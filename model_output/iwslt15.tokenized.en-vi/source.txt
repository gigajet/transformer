Whoa !

Not exactly .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Which was awesome .
Explore .
No kidding .
What a fish .
Sort of .
Ta-da !
Genius .
Absolutely .
Extraordinary .
It &apos;s true .
We love entertainment .
Awesome .
Yes , well ...
Nice one .
Thank you .
Will you ?
Thank you .
... yet .
Thank you .
1.5 million .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Yeah . Okay .
Guess what ?
Thanks , Tom .
A real school .
It &apos;s everywhere .
And they did .
They all matter .
Not very sustainable .
We know that .
They actually hurt .
This is hard .
Pretty simple .
So meet Al .
This is not ...
We love innovation .
We were poor .
Creativity .
That &apos;s scary .
That was us .
Thank you guys .
I swear .
They called me .
And he says ...
Thanks so much .
It &apos;s interesting .
It was faster .
There she is .
Wooo !
Is that all ?
after one week .
From Seattle ...
A few less .
This was the result .
I am a writer .
I resisted it .
These guys make money .
Oh , my God !
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t know .
So here it is .
It is generic .
He answers the door .
Yeah . All right .
Thank you so much .
Yeah , I know .
That &apos;s very good .
Thank you very much .
I represent children .
Is she conscious ?
Is that something ?
I &apos;m Tom .
Oh ! Oh !
It has sensors .
It sounds scary .
Like twice over .
It &apos;s personal .
So what happened ?
Raw data .
But many die .
It feels great .
I actually am .
Very different notion .
It was crazy .
That &apos;s huge .
Hard is hard .
I can help you .
It &apos;s a lot .
So I made one .
But it hadn &apos;t .
Thank you very much .
What was the result ?
Thank you . Thanks .
Thank you very much .
Good job ! Yeah !
But I felt worse .
Here &apos;s another example .
Thank you very much .
Listen to understand .
What would you say ?
Thank you very much .
The sun is rising .
Thank you very much .
It doesn &apos;t exist .
We are the soil .
And I was scared .
Hold it up .
Thank you very much .
1,000 , very good .
We &apos;re losing them .
Go home to where ?
Why not live longer ?
I was amazed .
Be a mentor .
Can I be honest ?
But the point is ...
Robert Gupta .
Thank you very much .
The farm &apos;s incredible .
What did they do ?
Next would be nuclear .
Oh , that guy .
There &apos;s no normal .
It &apos;s a crisis .
Thank you so much .
Just do your job .
Thank you very much .
And you love it .
It &apos;s about concrete .
This is a trick .
And that &apos;s architecture .
All right , ready ?
Thank you very much .
Ban is blank .
She can have fun .
Today I am 22 .
The answer is easy .
You can be extraordinary .
I lost all hope .
And that &apos;s important .
We &apos;re taking off .
What does it mean ?
Hey , why not ?
Thank you very much .
My hunches again .
after only one trip .
He is my grandfather .
Play &apos;s essential .
I don &apos;t know .
This is the cord .
We activate communities .
Why should I worry ?
So what happened here ?
And so I did .
But it gets worse .
An almost identical structure .
Does that sound good ?
These changes are coming .
Maybe 10 times more .
There is no feed .
And this was fascinating .
This is really exciting .
They really loved it .
Everything is different now .
Let &apos;s do this .
You could see Manhattan .
These are huge questions .
Thank you very much .
We take photos constantly .
It could take months .
What creates the illusion ?
He kept pointing here .
How engaged you are .
But you know what ?
Thank you very much .
Here is the video .
Good afternoon , everybody .
Is that your opinion ?
So they know everything .
Thank you very much .
It keeps you fresh .
This is really cool . &quot;
This is the last one .
It &apos;s in Seattle .
Each of us is conscious .
Many of them drown .
There were no back doors .
No , it didn &apos;t .
I was so shocked .
We have online criminals .
Ohhhh .
There were still fishes .
Just be who you are .
How about fitness ?
Quite a few more .
One is South Korea .
I don &apos;t think so .
Who does the very best ?
Fly away , cat .
The orange tractor .
This is Stephen Watt .
What about longevity ?
And it &apos;s pretty amazing .
Most die on impact .
What does this mean ?
We have zero infrastructure .
We victims need everyone .
What happens is this .
This happened around Christmas .
And that &apos;s nothing .
Score them again .
So what happens here ?
Superior technology .
And I thought about that .
I have to use words .
And he leapt .
This was the very first .
Peace . Thank you .
That was awkward .
But there &apos;s another thing .
It &apos;s spreading virally .
Solar technology is ...
And here &apos;s the thing .
And I felt really good .
So let me recap .
Okay , there &apos;s some .
The first : Cut .
I don &apos;t believe that .
It will get to you .
So let me remind you .
We &apos;ve been disconnected .
I was in awe .
He liked it very much .
I &apos;ve got a question .
And that worked pretty well .
It &apos;s completely directed .
JK : Both .
And the answer is no .
My name is Amit .
I &apos;ve loved only two .
Thank you . Thank you .
Now , who &apos;s normal ?
Yes , there it is .
Sound familiar ? Right .
inventing his own narrative .
So that started the journey .
This is South Los Angeles .
I live in South Central .
And here &apos;s me today .
Actually , for 10 years .
We have three main groups .
So here &apos;s another example .
So Scott gets this call .
And then it happened again .
I was devastated .
He retreated into silence .
And then everybody moved down .
Will I like the color ?
That &apos;s a great question .
Turn the camera off .
Isn &apos;t that awesome ?
They don &apos;t want that .
So this is for real .
And it took 18 months .
This picture &apos;s from there .
But it was very sad .
There &apos;s almost nothing left .
And here is a surprise .
That &apos;s super important .
Tremendously challenging .
You could have done better .
Very expensive real estate .
And the answer is yes .
And those days are gone .
And I always have been .
This is Ohio .
It is absolutely gorgeous .
And what is that thing ?
And it even got better .
She did it in secret .
Is it just imaginary ?
We are a smaller brand .
What else is risky ?
This would have been fine .
Well , I was next .
I wanted to support them .
What defines a story ?
How do we know that ?
This is an old study .
He had had the experience .
So this is a wish .
And I was an artist .
Finally : epic meaning .
So I set up everything .
The flows have increased .
This is really tough stuff .
This is a nice building .
And I looked like this .
No , not like that .
What would that be like ?
Other teams followed suit .
One was Jason .
Many are not so fortunate .
I &apos;m not for that .
How do we do that ?
I was kind of extreme .
I &apos;m actually an engineer .
Jack is our favorite . &quot;
How predictive is it ?
So why does that matter ?
I never will forget it .
Her mother raised her alone .
Here &apos;s the building working .
You saw the big peak .
Some have come and gone .
That is a fantastic question .
I remember my first fire .
I see this plus sign .
Let &apos;s call him Don .
Tremendously exciting .
And I tried something interesting .
Like that , you know .
There should be an understanding .
Many are not so fortunate .
That was a powerful moment .
You can enter inside it .
And here I am today .
That &apos;s the whole idea .
And then somebody complained .
Were we being followed ?
Ha . He &apos;s ready .
But they do the job .
There are billions of them .
And then it went international .
There were remixes .
And the family gathered .
And I memorized everything .
Okay , a bit more .
I couldn &apos;t bear it .
It &apos;s interesting to me .
So where do we go ?
Are you comfortable with that ?
The match begins -- silence .
Thanks for you patience .
I like really nice clothes .
I am not my father .
He never made it there .
You are speaking your truth .
No expensive staff time required .
Don &apos;t they sound incredible ?
And I was very proud .
Have you seen these guys ?
It connected those two people .
Three times out of 10 .
First overtime , second .
That &apos;s very risky .
Can we do this differently ?
I will never forget it .
Well , that &apos;s simple .
It was all very normal .
The ball comes off track .
Fans want that experience .
So I had an idea .
What is it , then ?
So I broke the silence .
He told me two things .
These girls were so lucky .
Or is it photography ?
They &apos;re using their hands .
So how does it happen ?
You always lose rare animals .
He was actually collecting fish .
I sometimes push too hard .
She did it for three years .
But I will do a trial .
It &apos;s not moving like that .
All right , let &apos;s go .
They were still kind of happy .
So , I just started playing .
They speared each other .
Does Canada have its own consciousness ?
You step up into the pocket .
It was more entertaining .
Now don &apos;t get me wrong .
It &apos;s much better than that .
He screamed a lot .
Italy wins . Yeah .
That &apos;s cool , huh ?
Aww , thank you .
So , here &apos;s what happens .
This is a lot of volume .
So let &apos;s have a look .
Don &apos;t be daunted .
He died broken by history .
So what opened my eyes ?
Here you see the city .
It &apos;s not our struggle .
And his answer was yes .
Because apparently we don &apos;t .
That moment changed my life .
Does it predict artificial intelligence ?
Think about your own choices .
I &apos;m the pet guy .
Um , my brand ?
It &apos;s not our problem .
I went to prison -- difficult .
So what was the next step ?
It can know where we are .
And I went back to work .
Why did I go into medicine ?
It &apos;s called batting average .
It &apos;s not our burden .
I mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
Centers were established .
This is not a finished story .
It &apos;s called The Cloud .
Your plant can blow up .
That &apos;s easy , huh ?
Who are these cousins ?
I wanted to keep us healthy .
How many people would choose creativity ?
It will look something like this .
I was exposed to him .
And I &apos;ve never seen them .
Everybody applauded politely .
He turns off the engines .
I don &apos;t love that question .
2.5 to one , great .
Who &apos;s going to be sure ?
If you burn coal , no .
They actually make us worse off .
The truth is more like this .
Leave that up to us .
It is the criteria .
Let &apos;s take a step back .
And everyone was doing the same .
See , I &apos;m an artist .
Let &apos;s call him Don too .
Remi knows what love is .
They sort of go like this .
Somehow this isn &apos;t working .
I mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
My mother phoned minutes later .
And this video is real time .
It cost 2.7 billion dollars .
Thank you very much , guys .
Keep going . Have fun .
And I grew up in India .
I &apos;ve lived a good life .
This is an ecological network .
&quot; Yes , &quot; he said .
But what are your fish eating ?
They flooded the canals .
I &apos;m going to stop that .
You have that much uncertainty .
I want to ask a question .
So , please forgive me .
Do you want them distressed ?
The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
This is a family portrait .
It was more like a restaurant .
And I was distraught .
But lions are very clever .
So they kill the lions .
But you have to maintain it .
And I will talk about this .
My family believes in me .
They sell certificates .
And it really changed the dynamic .
We worked well into each night .
Will it be under $ 20 ?
Now how could this come about ?
I think this is really cool .
I probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
And apparently it was quite popular .
You can see the water coming .
Want to feed the world ?
They literally flipped the switch .
It is a completely different notion .
You have not changed the story .
Everybody talks about happiness these days .
So that &apos;s a tough one .
First , we &apos;ve got population .
It &apos;s been constantly going up .
That &apos;s a little bit scary .
What do you think happens next ?
We made this game in 2007 .
So , you can do it .
And it was a huge success .
Well , what does that mean ?
Now , what does that mean ?
I could be that person . &quot;
There have been several close calls .
Are you still smart or not ?
How about that pancake ? &quot;
The most important thing is passion .
But they mean two different things .
They kill our livestock .
We see all the same symptoms .
So why did I do that ?
One of them was this grandmother .
Dwarves became columns .
It &apos;s not enough by itself .
But how do we do that ?
There &apos;s simply no privacy .
She absolutely loves her reflection .
And I know why it happens .
We do overcome some things .
Suicide is preventable .
Would you know what to say ?
It was called Talibanization .
Yes , I must mention it .
And what happens at the end ?
Let me tell you a secret .
Just go and read her book .
The book was published in 2009 .
This is a dead turtle .
That &apos;s the real zipper .
You can see all of this .
Do they know where we live ?
And I &apos;ll tell you why .
It may even be your story .
But most people don &apos;t agree .
Privacy is implied .
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
They stopped us from being inspired .
And this made me really sad .
Okay . Thank you very much .
So what happened on this day ?
Well she was back all right .
And there &apos;s hundreds of them .
They &apos;re all important choices . &quot;
This was my first sunburn .
Talk about getting by with nothing .
This is what suicide does .
You stood for the right cause .
You think the Internet was big .
I would have that hard conversation .
This person has never been born .
So planning has this blind spot .
You can give somebody an idea .
That &apos;s 20 Central Parks .
It &apos;s about all of us .
I want to make them public .
Is it something about the light ?
And fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
She was back and near death .
Now we see the opposite effect .
That &apos;s ammunition .
I had written these crazy things .
So I followed my hunches .
So what happened years afterward ?
Let &apos;s starting with sensing .
I like things that are different .
You brought your pictures , right ?
That &apos;s the two-cent tour .
Mark , Mark , come back .
And so we measured its motion .
It really comes from these artists .
This is an idea worth spreading .
Imagine a plane full of smoke .
It &apos;s part of our life .
What do you think happened then ?
You know , is it rational ?
They were seeing something magical .
I &apos;m a lawyer brand .
You can be logical and intuitive .
We certainly need one to succeed .
We truly thank God for you .
But my daughter never complained .
Not everybody gets to do that .
This is happening to us today .
We asked around and nobody knew .
But it &apos;s not documented .
I represent people on death row .
The only country in the world .
Life hadn &apos;t changed for centuries .
No had never been an option .
... Meaning not so optimistic .
I almost never cook with it .
It &apos;s just better than reality .
It &apos;s a vacation community .
Because architecture actually moves quite quickly .
And then , something amazing happened .
We &apos;re working with local communities .
Talk about what you heard here .
He needed them to feel protected .
How could we help you ? &quot;
Even cats were watching this video .
She shares her experience with others .
All the adults knew the risks .
So you can have this cloud .
This data was not available before .
You can zoom around very simply .
That does not hold for emotions .
Okay , we can do that .
We &apos;re constantly running into each other .
But the reality is far from it .
Didn &apos;t make sense to me .
Is it going to be my size ?
&quot; Best in the business . &quot;
Gamers don &apos;t sit around .
I &apos;ll get my sleeve back .
I wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
Everybody needs a fishbowl .
I &apos;m quite fond of it .
How do we take that next step ?
It was very time-consuming .
It &apos;s this , just like this .
And I kept asking myself these questions .
It was not drowned yet .
It would be unconscionable .
But what will come in the future ?
Which one would you like the most ?
He shook his head , no .
It doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
But they were right , you know .
How about living longer with good health ?
Well , that &apos;s not quite right .
What do you want to do ? &quot;
It &apos;s just not going to happen .
They haven &apos;t given up on government .
And the thing is , I am .
It makes life hard for us .
We talk about bold , fresh .
Tell me about this world .
She kind of set us up .
So Jesus , what a thought !
He showed it to Javier .
And I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
And the garden , it was beautiful .
They are far from being extinct .
Now we didn &apos;t write this app .
Oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
My name is Brian Goldman .
And it was what I was feeling .
But I carried on with my work .
Something stiffened inside me .
The roof also is covered with water .
I &apos;ve got something to show you .
Have a look what she &apos;s doing .
How many would opt for memory ?
And it &apos;s also very risky .
Now this is one of the images .
We love technology . We love creativity .
He pointed at the algae .
They reversed the flow of water .
So the correlation is low .
It is kind of a crazy idea .
And so that &apos;s a big challenge .
They are building an epic story .
And then they execute on it .
But there &apos;s another reason as well .
The official dogma of what ?
It &apos;s nothing if not ambitious .
This young child is eight years old .
This is a modest little app .
And it opens up a map .
That &apos;s the system that we have .
What am I going to look at ?
And it &apos;s a very easy question .
But what are we doing with it ?
But there are two problems with that .
I began to feel a bit better .
But , but , you know what ?
You should ask for some of that .
I talk a lot about these issues .
I lived in parallel worlds .
I never knew him in real life .
It turns out to be really difficult .
So just imagine that for a moment .
But I don &apos;t buy anything new .
Play is not frivolous .
These will be irresistible .
No , that &apos;s what I thought .
And so that &apos;s what we did .
He wasn &apos;t alone when he started .
If you burn natural gas , no .
Let me read you the entry .
It was really , really quite profound .
And so that got me very excited .
Five million people use it every month .
This is true . I believe this .
They &apos;re homelands of somebody .
And the problem is not technology itself .
Let &apos;s be a part of this .
So let &apos;s pull up some video .
Just wanted to drop you a note .
This is Jason Garber .
Hundreds of schools were lost .
This kind of thinking isn &apos;t new .
They have nothing to compare it to .
Some of these may be counterintuitive .
And really you do the same thing .
And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
You move around , you have fun .
We went and looked at a site .
One billion people will go hungry today .
They &apos;re feasting . &quot;
We need to get the message out .
I could draw . I could paint .
Now , this sounds crazy , right ?
And there are several reasons for this .
Why not think about it this way ?
I think it &apos;s odious .
We need to go far , quickly .
That image reminded me of something .
This is a completely unsustainable pattern .
And those are the neural structures .
It &apos;s an amazing multi-track movie .
They want to be their favorite player .
You just go out and react .
It &apos;s really the most scary thing .
What would we be capable of then ?
The machines would rise up against us .
Thank you so much . Thank you .
My friend got to come with me .
They are bird-blending machines .
And he was very , very sorry .
But today , it goes beyond that .
So go ahead and start inventing .
And it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
And every morning I hop on it .
How do I get this removed ? &quot;
Actually , I made two more mistakes .
She is no more a free individual .
Is there a single equation for intelligence ?
My interpreter told me their stories .
She also had duplicates .
We &apos;re pale , gray creatures .
We don &apos;t work from offices .
It &apos;s 150 feet by 10 feet .
You can see every step I take .
I &apos;m still breaking the silence today .
They will tap your Internet connection .
Introduce some mutations perhaps .
And they don &apos;t tell us much .
It might take a moment to load .
I &apos;m human . I make mistakes .
I am a redefined physician .
This is a photograph of the object .
You &apos;re an inspiring person .
And I began giving her my rap .
They had a concept of blue blood .
You can go all the way through .
You can play with a different type .
The whole building is made of water .
Just spread it as wide as possible .
Monday : Color is powerful .
That &apos;s a painting of a circle .
Imagine then just two other little changes .
So I guess that &apos;s my brand .
How would you guys describe your brand ?
He only has use of his eyes .
The captain waved me over .
So let &apos;s think about the atoms .
And then some very funny things happened .
But it is not only about me .
All this is possible with this information .
Who sends whom a text message ?
A morning that I will never forget .
Abuse thrives only in silence .
Today I have just one request .
Let me show you how they work .
But it has an unexpected twist .
And we built an iPad application .
That &apos;s about all it can do .
I don &apos;t take the same history .
We can &apos;t get rid of it .
Now it turns out you &apos;re right .
I &apos;m not sure where we go .
And women successfully argued that .
I knew then how to self-identify .
So let &apos;s start with Sunday .
And you know what I &apos;ve learned ?
That &apos;s usually not the route .
And let me begin with one example .
Now , that blew my mind .
So with that , I thank you .
And that can make a big difference .
These are cell phones of the future .
You probably saw it on the news .
These flows are increasing very rapidly .
Our magazines are read by millions .
These are not trivial activities .
But what if you are that person ?
There is help . There is hope .
He said , &quot; You listened .
She had irreversible brain damage .
Well there are opportunities all around us .
Do we really want to go there ?
It &apos;s morning , before the match .
You see some fun stuff happening here .
The disaster is for that two billion .
People were suffering . People were fighting .
So don &apos;t worry about climate change .
156 nations carry our television channel .
In 1997 , this building opened .
It &apos;s there right at its heart .
Kevin is straight , as he says .
That was all I needed to hear .
There is a problem with community meetings .
She &apos;s not North Korean . &quot;
They &apos;re obscure , weird programs .
The first principle of aid is respect .
Today , there are 2.3 million .
I &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
What should our report card look like ?
Everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away .
All of these are consuming questions .
We go through initiation rites .
So I go in a different direction .
That determines good teams from bad .
The bad ones have information overload .
And you know what he told me ?
But we came across a new phenomenon .
Never apologize for that .
We &apos;re trying to prevent an impact .
in the cold , windy night .
So we started retouching photos .
Fans want to be on that field .
So Scott was speaking person-to-person .
Well I went into the courtroom .
And he whispered in my ear .
They had to worry about being bombed .
They &apos;re in the back of our body .
Or , is it , perhaps , possible ?
So , what do we have to do ?
You can drill into a particular year .
So that &apos;s reassuring , you know .
It &apos;s about repowering America .
Instead , everything we touched we killed .
Because think about how you consume architecture .
That means something built in a city .
I think we all have closets .
You think they can &apos;t possibly exist .
They had been pushed genetically .
Does it predict human-level intelligence ?
I even went through an identity crisis .
I felt like anyone could do that .
What other brands are like that ?
People need to feel good about it .
Maybe we can see it as change .
It has emotions , anger and happiness .
Ask anybody I have ever dated .
You know ? You can be anything .
Every time I use my mobile phone ?
Hi . This is my mobile phone .
Because I have nothing to hide . &quot;
LEGO made it accessible .
So it &apos;s feeding back on itself .
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
I worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
One of two things is going to happen .
Huh . Hang on a moment .
And she &apos;s hitting a 257 .
Because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money .
And I &apos;d like you to read it .
We still think it is pristine .
We &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .
And yet , there is this disconnect .
And that &apos;s a very sensible question .
And there is this stunning silence .
France scores . Italy scores .
And I had to get out of town .
Raise your hands . Let me see .
That was more for emphasis .
I &apos;m a redundant person .
Now this cartoon makes a lot of points .
We &apos;ve won a bunch of awards .
There &apos;s one more part to the story .
It &apos;s to supplement the experience .
You want to navigate around the museum ?
The chef had overcooked it .
And the object of this is quite simple .
I wear jeans almost all the time .
Number one : Be authentic .
I &apos;m always the one taking the picture .
He has a selective one , though .
Here &apos;s a description of the road .
He kept pacing back and forth .
I didn &apos;t know the protocols .
And that was 19 yeas ago .
And this is Felix , actually .
And this is about shifting baseline .
Some I even considered like my second home .
You have to create a new profession .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s on the street .
Like me , they are dreaming big .
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
Let &apos;s see . Yeah , it worked .
and issue rogue certificates .
The shores are from a different location .
Something really weird is going on here .
So I &apos;m just going to enter in .
It &apos;s a complete denial of mistakes .
The three words are : Do you remember ?
Maybe I did it for a good reason .
The third technique : Categorization .
Here &apos;s their jam aisle .
Boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
But then reality &apos;s always unpredictable .
I was trying to preserve the body .
I want to help you calm down .
It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers .
I fell out of love with this fish .
It shouldn &apos;t take away from other things .
We have something that &apos;s not going up .
They divided the entire kingdom in half .
But it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
Now I put a bass line in .
This is the thing about symbols .
And we don &apos;t grow out of it .
Airbrushing is now routine .
What would that look like on the field ?
Oh my God ! Aaaah !
And , finally , this storage problem .
We have to gradually increase the complexity .
It &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
Defeat would have come too easily .
&quot; You have not let it go . &quot;
My mother asked us to feel her hand .
No apple has ever tasted the same .
We don &apos;t have that kind of situation .
That &apos;s about a 15-foot boat .
Who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
We &apos;ve got some places we can go .
Do they do that for the children ? &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
What are the emotions that can be measured ?
Everybody would like to make people happier .
If this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
Let &apos;s first begin with a thought experiment .
Also , these are intermittent sources .
It &apos;s the most powerful thing you own .
So , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
That was the first upright primate .
And this is a classic gaming emotion .
No . I &apos;m serious . I am .
Their problem is that they have too little .
Go bother Leonard Cohen . &quot;
It &apos;s not a science of explanations .
There &apos;s nothing we know about more directly .
These were the men I looked up to .
I am not here to inspire you .
More people watched games because it was faster .
This is the jaw-dropper .
And you observe a really strange effect .
They just want their own pain to end .
But then you really want to go deep .
Two ways of going in -- very simple .
And it also involved new choices for leaders .
&quot; Absolutely , &quot; I said .
And even Lomborg has changed .
Now , that &apos;s just an insurance policy .
This is the one with the greatest impact .
And it completely changed how I do movies .
And that &apos;s why I made the movie .
And there are also tons of collaborators .
They simply listen and then begin to speak .
And where are they looking to for inspiration ?
No knock on the neuroscientists .
Fans want to be on the field .
They like winning . It makes them money .
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
The world turned into a big black hole .
The technologies do not exist to do that .
So what you do -- you shut up .
You &apos;re working on other electrical inventions .
Because this time it wasn &apos;t coming up .
No one knows what the hell we do .
We did not prioritize right .
And there it was , a great revolution .
So what is the problem with vultures ?
Please don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
Where am I from ? Who am I ?
Privacy is not up for discussion .
And I put my challenge on 95 kg .
People seem to think politics is sexy .
It can know how we &apos;re holding it .
And why are these informations there ?
Let &apos;s make it Kogi . &quot;
Small windows , dehumanizing scale .
But let &apos;s show our kids the truth .
But it &apos;s also damaging health .
It may just take the right crazy idea .
Because teams always use technology to win games .
Ask me what I did not do .
I used education for emancipation .
Intelligence -- what is it ?
I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
I couldn &apos;t offer them any direct help .
Plus you get strawberries .
We had a victory on our hands .
And I figured , this has to stop .
Well you can see where this is going .
These devices aren &apos;t accessible to people . &quot;
The company headquarters are right here .
But it does require a lot of planning .
We &apos;re right at that point of transition .
I can remember that like it was yesterday .
The second mistake that I made was worse .
and to report back to my attending .
We all love baseball , don &apos;t we ?
And one time we caught a live one .
And we &apos;ve had some fantastic presentations .
Her father died soon after she was born .
We &apos;ll come back to these people later .
Second half . End of normal time .
Let me tell you a bit about it .
All right , what is brand Gerry ?
So that &apos;s kind of our battle cry .
The film hasn &apos;t even been distributed yet .
Your movie has smell and taste and touch .
And I said , &quot; What speech ? &quot;
Another important consequence is goal seeking .
This should be the first principle of aid .
What &apos;s the next one on your list ?
I got tired of seeing this happening .
It &apos;s about knowing you &apos;re not alone .
It &apos;s really become sacred to us .
We always wondered what they knew about us .
So littleBits is open-source .
He just wanted to share a rainbow .
One I thought had a kidney stone .
I actually learned about this from my grandmother .
But so many over the years were helped .
Play is not just child &apos;s games .
A has these benefits , and these risks .
And that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
This is just not some blue sky thinking .
This would be someone who &apos;s entirely intuitive .
You zoom in . You really go in .
It &apos;s hard to overstate the destruction .
We need to go for more research funding .
And so , we need energy miracles .
So , we can give ourselves a gift .
You know , what are the lessons learned ?
So , this crazy story might be true .
And then we get all this positive feedback .
What ? That really flipped me out .
We talk about drowning in data .
Here , he &apos;s bringing the sun out .
Now , this is an interactive cartoon application .
But my educated mother became a teacher .
My fourth technique : Condition for complexity .
My grandmother never let me forget his life .
So that was the reason for the project .
How are you going to feed the world ?
The second factor is the services we use .
So to him , they were just blocks .
New investments to create high-paying jobs .
So did every mayor in the world .
And her voice was the most powerful voice .
We just need to up the resolution .
Take the armor off . Be yourself .
And you know who we love ? Jack .
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses .
And when we do this , who knows ?
You have to fight for it every day .
Repower America . Find out more .
So a microwave is a similar system .
It &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
It could happen in learning time scales .
Jimmy Kimmel actually .
And I thought I could blend in .
Who could ever wish it on their own ?
You see the timeline on the top .
It &apos;s something we knew how to do .
The first is that we will not evolve .
And that &apos;s what these brands did .
They need to tell me about my brand .
I can &apos;t , but this guy can .
Unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
You can jump right into a specific issue .
Which is great , because we need that .
I wanted to restore health from disease .
And so , the question becomes , how ?
These North Koreans were not so lucky .
Because evolution could now happen within an individual .
We created an emotional reaction to these forms .
Nobody started a company alone . No one .
I &apos;m here to share my photography .
Baseball is filled with some amazing statistics .
They become rarer because we fish them .
So there &apos;s an opportunity to change that .
Okay , you really want to hear that ?
They did it by draining the land .
Simple information processing , simple consciousness .
There are no truly easy problems with consciousness .
The summer was a lucky summer -- 2006 .
They &apos;re becoming like computers in open air .
Now I work in the solar technology industry .
Failed writer-alcoholic brand .
But what this image represents was the problem .
But just substitute apartment building for cities .
So you could feel good about selling it .
This is the machine below Geneva .
And his whole work process changed after that .
Every system might have some degree of consciousness .
Well I say , more power to him .
That is their story , not yours .
This is on the street for a reason .
They are hardly monogamous .
And let me show you a simple example .
Goodnight sweet opossum . &quot;
And somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
Now we do the same with airplanes .
The responses mostly will be &quot; no . &quot;
It &apos;s hard to imagine it taking much longer .
I wasn &apos;t a citizen of that country .
One of them got caught up in the water .
Government ? Forget about it !
And here &apos;s where those guns come in .
This is Bjorn Sundin .
Oh , my God . Oh , my God .
They put her on a ventilator .
Do you want to come over and listen ? &quot;
We don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
And then my brother started staring at me .
I said , &quot; Okay , Mama . &quot;
I didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
Intersex comes in a lot of different forms .
Sexual reproduction enters the picture .
What are you going to do with it ? &quot;
This is about one percent of the total population .
And the form has something to do with it .
This is hitting the reservoirs .
There &apos;s a lot of techniques in this approach .
I made the decision to move to the U.S .
Are you ready ? You look a little nervous .
This guy &apos;s name is TEMPT .
So , it &apos;s not just about the words .
I hold the knife in my hand .
So this is what the supermarket is like .
No more having to worry about forgetting plays .
This is only virtual reality , V.R .
You take the snap and you drop back .
All this is possible with your mobile phone .
But boys are not immune to this either .
Or are you more of a down attribute ?
I want to shine a light on slavery .
Wrong . They were all enslaved .
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable .
Please -- don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
He has the most impeccable memory .
So you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
We &apos;re harnessing energy from the sun .
This is a chart of what it looked like .
But I &apos;m going to ask you a question .
Who are they actually supposed to be informing ?
We &apos;re constantly creating tensions and conflicts .
And I &apos;m going to admit something to you .
I said , &quot; Okay , Mama . &quot;
I didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
And it &apos;s not just in terms of sex .
But this is not yet augmented reality .
Or are you more of a down attribute ?
Tell me a little bit about that part .
That wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
I &apos;ve got it here on my laptop . &quot;
It &apos;s great , but I was in love .
Thank you , Danny Kahneman .
There &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
There is a lot of happiness coaching .
There &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
That &apos;s headed up to about nine billion .
You have to be willing to take those risks .
But those are all the roads in the U.S .
Every large image is the beginning of a section .
So here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
The fact is , coal isn &apos;t dirty .
so people who are much shorter than typical .
First question to answer for us : so what ?
So do you still not want to continue ? &quot;
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world .
I didn &apos;t know he was abusing me .
Also the noise will disappear in these pores .
What do you do with certificates ?
We &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
Someone made an old timey version .
Slowly but surely , it lifted .
Here &apos;s their olive oil aisle .
This was the sailfin grouper .
We don &apos;t really know very much about it .
A lot of my clients are very young .
I knew she had come to say goodbye .
I told my mother I couldn &apos;t do it .
It shouldn &apos;t be so easy to end it .
We have reached a kind of equipoise .
I wanted us to live long and healthy lives .
And ultimately , we have to embrace transparency .
When you look at the people you deal with ..
Thank you guys very much . That was awesome .
It &apos;s more than that ; it &apos;s deeper .
And every evening , they fly 150 miles back .
I said , &quot; Chicken pellets ? &quot;
You &apos;re teaching them to open doors for themselves .
It might sound like it &apos;s a bad thing .
Now I &apos;ll put some percussion in .
Third : escalation of expectations .
They &apos;re all on their way back underground now .
They &apos;re not doing anything out of the ordinary .
&quot; It &apos;s usually in the big hall . &quot;
I know what people think when they see this .
Here are the results we just obtained .
It &apos;s called &quot; Talk to Me . &quot;
So that made sense , that was a match .
We don &apos;t want Iran to get the bomb .
I want to achieve it through not dying . &quot;
We have been here for about 130,000 years .
This is another look at the tree of life .
The first on here is the classic , Apple .
What about me ? What about a regular guy ?
He says , &quot; Brace for impact . &quot;
And then what do you do with the waste ?
This is something that has to get to zero .
Well , I think number one is curiosity .
We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft since 1994 .
Now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
Why in the hell would they not okay this ?
Dosage has something to do with this .
And I see Greg LeMond now .
They manage the process , they understand the process .
Here &apos;s this couple on the Hamptons .
And if not , do your dance anyhow .
But that &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
Well , today &apos;s teenagers are rarely alone .
Why is there this inner subjective movie ?
How do we use this to win games ? &quot;
Blue 8 ! Blue 8 ! Go !
That must be quite the experience to be there .
Can I get a pancake , please ? &quot;
I want to introduce you to Kofi .
I shut up , and listen to them . &quot;
And let that be your weapon of choice .
Now , there &apos;s a profound irony here .
How much money does it take to do this ?
Here , let me give you an analogy .
What &apos;s the feed conversion ratio ? &quot;
Amazingly , it was still delicious .
There seems to be a discrepancy .
What we want to do is make the future .
I don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
Because they have special skills of facilitation .
Music is medicine . Music changes us .
Yes , I &apos;m afraid of all those things .
Well , imagine you &apos;re the quarterback .
I truly believe Kevin was crying out for help .
My prayers are with you for your fight .
The role model good girl should be very quiet .
Do not give them that sense of false hope .
And here you can see Roberto dancing .
&quot; We have no freedom , &quot; they said .
What can you do ? Can you make it ?
They were already drowning in manure .
So I figured that the problem is the solution .
They &apos;re our natural garbage collectors .
And here every piece is very well planned .
Then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
Save those . Kill off the rest .
It &apos;s about as far as we go out .
So , if you could bring up the lights .
Now I &apos;ve been talking a lot about magic .
Good , really good , maybe an all-star .
They had 348 different kinds of jam .
They were moving towards a naturalistic concept .
Each iceberg has its own individual personality .
It happened twice more on the honeymoon .
And we can &apos;t give you enough of it .
That &apos;s a lot to pack into 18 minutes .
She &apos;s just turned one and started to walk .
But this is still a science of correlations .
Science , by its nature , is objective .
They are not things to do with our bodies .
Ugh , getting tackled sucks .
There were no windows large enough to climb through .
We got dirty , and we loved it .
And my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
So I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
They own 26 square miles of vacant lots .
And this is how I decided to maintain it .
So you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?
That means they can be self-administered .
And that &apos;s a multi-million dollar corporation .
Engines , gearshift -- four choices .
I think I might have actually heard more hands .
Now who &apos;s ready to go on this trip .
It was this misguided war on drugs .
What would you say to someone who believed that ?
And I think that opportunity exists all around us .
And these women would get together and just talk .
Well I believe that our identity is at risk .
For a year we were penniless .
In many cases , people are actually perfectly healthy .
And anyway , Italy won at the end .
It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive .
And if not , Stuxnet does nothing .
But play &apos;s a shapeshifter .
Embrace fear . Embrace risk .
I know this might be broadcast broadly .
The permanent ice is marked in red .
It &apos;s also for jocks . Who knew ?
We have little option but to open this door .
The question , &quot; Why does she stay ? &quot;
So actually , I was in very good company .
Several times we can repeat that .
But wait , this is actually my favorite project .
The bricks are color-coded .
So I think the basics are quite simple .
And in this case , a neighbor saw it .
And who could have predicted any of this ?
Cats were watching other cats watch this video .
You can have a succession of changes .
They were maturing at five centimeters .
I believe that for every person on the planet .
This old man &apos;s grandfather refused to go .
My cousins would be running around everywhere .
Let me tell you about some of the pieces .
But in practice , how do you do it ?
Both are viable ; both take off .
The goal of this whole film is transparency .
They even can bring with them some financing .
The ones who make scientific arguments are very few .
You hope you don &apos;t need to do that .
That would power the U.S. for hundreds of years .
The Internet and its services are a miracle .
Let me give you good close look at this .
And it &apos;s also deeply embedded in our lives .
However there is a political battle in our country .
But the volumes are much larger than ever .
This is an annual melting river .
We &apos;re seeing this process feeding back on itself .
And guess what we found in the attack code ?
Are you mindful , sophisticated like 007 ?
They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project .
We found it was moving in really weird ways .
Now , would you choose the same vacation ?
We think of our future as anticipated memories .
An energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
But we &apos;re beginning to see a sea change .
He is our very first starchitect .
Even a photon has some degree of consciousness .
So there can never be a science of consciousness .
Some people say a science of consciousness is impossible .
The only good thing in the box was hope .
We might produce the next George Washington Carver .
So that worked . So booya for Scott .
Second , what economists call &quot; opportunity costs . &quot;
And so every drop was a little bit different .
And actually I become a character in the book .
What they need is a redefined medical culture .
So you don &apos;t lose abundant animals .
And the fish also were happy to be there .
So you can reconstruct a whole movement .
Think about this : this attack is generic .
So again , that was a real good match .
And ecologically , it was a disaster .
So here we have some natural fireflies .
The world today has 6.8 billion people .
Well let me work up some blood for you .
And then I &apos;ll explain why I explained it .
We did the exercise again with the same students .
I look forward to talking with all of you .
And I remember this just like it happened yesterday .
We can &apos;t expect to solve it overnight .
There is no harder , there is just hard .
And what I realized is I needed an expert .
Now imagine being in a plane with no sound .
So hard conversations are still not my strong suit .
Vultures also have tremendous historical significance .
Because otherwise , our problems would even be bigger .
I &apos;m going to deal directly with the artist .
We &apos;ve gotta figure out which brands .
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental .
We would never do that in our own countries .
Well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
You know how many people watch these TED Talks ?
Is it something about the details or the colors ?
So nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
So this is where we need digital safety systems .
So we start with a Windows dropper .
Make it possible , everyone in this room .
Thinking , you know , two percent .
Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics .
At least , I know about my consciousness directly .
Can they really store all this information about us ?
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
So he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them .
The more it changes , the faster it changes .
And we &apos;re actually doing some litigation .
And yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
But our lives are much more than our memories .
And we &apos;re not exactly sure why that happens .
And imagine each of them then controlled by people .
But we know very little about where things go .
That &apos;s more than 250 hundred-thousand acres .
How &apos;s that look out there ? Pretty good .
But settling isn &apos;t always such a bad thing .
But here &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to be thinking .
And instead of panicking , he just stopped .
But , what &apos;s the problem with all of this ?
Now how do we get to augmented reality ?
Thank you . That was so lovely . Thank you .
This wasn &apos;t a brothel , per se .
You don &apos;t get a chance to mess it up .
See , I have a legacy in South Central .
Sometimes you can create potholes with that .
They gave her medications to raise her blood pressure .
Here are two different jewelry displays .
Tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
Thursday : Confidence is key .
You don &apos;t know where it &apos;s going to land .
&quot; Look at their bellies , pink .
Here &apos;s the updated version of this entry .
It will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers .
So this is the specimen coming out now .
Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive .
I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
There &apos;s no hospital that can say &quot; No . &quot;
So , this is World Without Oil .
And as I move around my finger shifts .
I &apos;m going to go ahead and select government .
There &apos;s world records that are on this as well .
We had to take them out , which we did .
Hold on , let &apos;s get a little closer .
It &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
So , I &apos;m going to wrap up now .
My grandfather committed suicide by poisoning .
How would you like to be better than you are ?
It &apos;s like , who do I want to be ?
I only wish I could see my kids grow up .
It &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s tired .
I was there not long ago with Miguel .
Well , again , it should have the two elements .
It was almost beyond the threshold of imagination .
And these interactive portraits are aware of each other .
Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame .
So , the living give birth to the spirits .
This is the thing about postmodernism .
This is my niece , Stella .
This may sound a bit kooky to you .
So I have lived in this body a long time .
More people watched the game because it was more exciting .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
We are so close to being able to do this .
So within a matter of weeks , it happens again .
Tell us why your science is relevant to us .
These are 35,830 lines of information .
They clean up carcasses right to the bone .
Politics is not changing ; government is changing .
No one has to green-light your idea .
And I went back to my work on the wards .
And that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagnosis to make .
Somehow this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?
That &apos;s just a working title , by the way .
The flamingos eat the shrimp .
It has moments of experience , one after the other .
But I didn &apos;t let that daunt me .
We do not want to try to predict the future .
Who in the room has a mobile phone with you ?
There &apos;s step-by-step instructions on this .
So now they understand the value of prototyping .
The marshmallow has to be on top .
Now he &apos;s brought a tractor into the scene .
And they can also sense their motion and tilt .
And the world we now live in looks like this .
If your job is to dance , do your dance .
If you want to go far , go together . &quot;
And he supposes that phi goes along with consciousness .
I can &apos;t be certain that you guys are conscious .
I learn from other disabled people all the time .
We &apos;ve come a long , long way since then .
And this vicious cycle goes on , goes on .
So he jumps in and kills the animals .
What are you going to get out of those samples ?
How could it be possible that we would do this ?
Because MPs do not keep the environment clean .
I want to challenge that . Do you know why ?
Sometimes , I saw dead bodies floating down the river .
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
So in other words , I define what I wanted .
Ohhhhh , wowwww !
And it starts with one physician at a time .
And she said the three words : Do you remember ?
That &apos;s the kind of shame that is a teacher .
Because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
It was a store called Draeger &apos;s .
Well because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
They don &apos;t talk about God and God &apos;s nature .
That &apos;s the consequence that we have to face .
And this is the plot behind Stuxnet .
Grants and sponsors were sought .
It could take an hour . It could take weeks .
Dearborn , Michigan . Henry Ford .
So you got this scholarship . Yep .
And the indicator box makes the lights flash .
So I grew up hating lions so much .
That was , I don &apos;t know what happened there .
So luckily I brought an outfit change .
It &apos;s got one knob , on / off .
Procuring software usually takes a couple of years .
Writing down the DNA was an interesting step .
Well it was a Friday , this is true .
In 2010 , it was viewed 23 million times .
Given all of that , mistakes are inevitable .
Alone , ashamed and unsupported .
And at first I thought we were playing a game .
We talk about the curse of information overload .
So I think we have to be in the lead .
And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old .
What &apos;s the next one you want to talk about ?
It &apos;s all coming out of our own pockets .
But I &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; Please blow up . &quot;
Instead , let &apos;s look to the ecological model .
It &apos;s that acrid , tar-like flavor .
Every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm .
Thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure .
The teachers didn &apos;t know a switch had been made .
And I tend to think of it like my shadow .
And I talked them into funding an expedition .
So , let me give you a little peek .
OK , think of this as extreme self-motivation .
I was an obsessive compulsive student .
The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products .
I do get tired , as we all do .
And the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
So how specifically will we see Ban in the film ?
What do you think the response is going to be ?
So TEMPT is now completely paralyzed .
So get in the game . Save the shoes .
If you have something to give , give it now .
I don &apos;t see any reason why it shouldn &apos;t .
So where would you put your brain on this scale ?
I learned that it all changes in an instant .
Feasting ? I was totally confused .

Now sometimes , the list of fundamentals expands .
Now , I &apos;m a scientific materialist at heart .
If you know you are gay , just say it .

That &apos;s a key element of making that report card .
I &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
You know , I was a real science geek .
Architects and engineers , thankfully .
Yes . What this is really doing is discovering .
I &apos;m not at all comfortable with that assumption .
We dance in the temple and become God . &quot;
The ethnosphere is humanity &apos;s great legacy .
Size zero models still dominate our catwalks .
But consciousness doesn &apos;t seem to fit into this picture .
Consciousness also is what makes life worth living .

This is not about how happily a person lives .
And you can ask : What happens to these moments ?
In the nuclear space , there are other innovators .
So let &apos;s think : How should we measure ourselves ?
See , Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking .
Otherwise , go bother somebody else today .
And finally , we &apos;re not on opposite sides anymore .

And so we have this terribly simplistic idea .
You can see on the left side a small boat .
You can move inside , have different types of experiences .
You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading .
I mean , what am I going to find today ?
That is the sole test of survival and success .
That &apos;s what keeps us going and keeps us developing .
Thanks . I haven &apos;t come to the best part .
So I want you to think about a thought experiment .
The experiencing self has no voice in this choice .
Now I &apos;d like to introduce you to my brothers .

And on the C.D. , this was on .
And I also ask myself , does it really work ?
Stasi was the secret police in East Germany .
I mean , nobody &apos;s ever seen a particle .
Am I South Korean or North Korean ?
It &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
Because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .

And try that again and do that for another generation .
It &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
And so it all brings us to one big question ...

She cries when her homework is incomplete .
But what if patients could do this test at home ?
This is not a question between privacy against security .

I start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
As an artist , connection is very important to me .
I want to tell you how we found that out .
I mean I &apos;ve rarely seen lines so flat .
Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent .
So , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
We don &apos;t make money at these damn shows .
So what do you think happened to these design students ?
The New York Times called this building a miracle .
Right now , nobody knows the answers to those questions .

Wherever there &apos;s information processing , there &apos;s consciousness .
Zak Ebrahim is not my real name .

Now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
We had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
This hit me when I went to replace my jeans .
I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love .
But it also has some fundamental limitations so far .

So in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
And the difference then , they perceive as a loss .
Other than writing a check , what could we do ?
I tell them , don &apos;t ask me what I did .
I filmed in war zones -- difficult and dangerous .
So this is all of the meta-data information .
Look to Miguel , farmers like Miguel .
He said , &quot; The skin acts like a sponge .
There are other pleasures , but this is dominant .
Now , the experiencing self lives its life continuously .

But you have to fight for your self-determination today .
When one neighbor helps another , we strengthen our communities .
And there are projects like this at every level of government .
How do you judge people based on the content of character ?
We can actually do the same thing with much less energy .
And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop .
I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
Wouldn &apos;t we want to open doors for them instead ?
I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction .
It &apos;s like asking somebody to swallow the sun .
We used it &#91; 200 &#93; years ago to build banks .

This is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia .
There &apos;s still a lot of work that needs to be done .
It &apos;s not even online . It &apos;s not even streaming .
She &apos;s okay . The question is whether we will be .
This is six months of my life , into this file .
So again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
And if you use your mobile phone , where you are .
This is a visualization of six months of my life .
In fact , their life depended on doing the job .
We can handle more categories than we can handle choices .

I always wondered why they had lights but we didn &apos;t .
As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
These communities of cells , again , began to abstract information .
We see the same thing with the disability rights movement .
If we fix cities , actually it &apos;s a big deal .
EEEEEE ! No , thank you .
Now the example I showed you was all about finding details .
It &apos;s a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .

A fish farm , but also a bird sanctuary .
So , I say : Let the world-changing games begin .

They probably even know the shoe size of the operator .
And the predictions , as you &apos;ve read , are serious .
She is a transgender beauty pageant manager .
Every day , I am so grateful because I am a woman .

The other place that &apos;s very interested in city building is Singapore .
I no longer want to postpone anything in life .
This second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
but one of them is distinctly worse than the other .
And it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
So , what can we synthesize out of all this ?
That was -- the creativity had to find its outlet somehow .
Probably many of you in the room know this trick .
Blaise , that is truly incredible . Congratulations .
And it &apos;s doing that based on the content inside the images .
I couldn &apos;t have done better . I didn &apos;t settle .
And no , this isn &apos;t Burning Man or San Francisco .
&quot; Before I die , I want to be completely myself . &quot;
I have that black lab , and I have that minivan .
I met Conor on a cold , rainy January night .
And I don &apos;t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .
But it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
He types &quot; Opossum &quot; into this official knowledge base .
But I think that there really is something coming along after us .
And yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the options of it .
So find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers .
Do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
We called it Digital Water Pavilion .
Now you don &apos;t find several thousand targets in that area .
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollingbroke .
In other words , play is our adaptive wildcard .
Now , chimpanzees are well-known for their aggression .
It caused immense celebration in the control room .
There &apos;s designers and builders of cities who are very interested .
Well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economically .
He &apos;s a biologist at Veta La Palma .
&quot; Well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
Now , the two selves bring up two notions of happiness .
Well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
But if you ask me today , I &apos;m not so sure .
Now , I also agree that that is rational , for now .
There &apos;s an economist named Edward Castronova .
We don &apos;t get that kind of constant feedback in real life .
Right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
With Pivot , you can drill into a decade .
So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
Why do they market to us if we can &apos;t buy them ?
And do you know what the answer to this question now is ?

They said , we don &apos;t want this data retention .
He kept one in the glove compartment of our car .
And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
You put a blue to a green , you can make light .
A few years ago I started developing littleBits .
The other thing is we know where all the gas stations are .
I &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
And that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
What they need is an environment to be able to do that .
I &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that I do .
It &apos;s about 120 feet above the water , or 40 meters .
It &apos;s both 3D scanning in real time and motion capture .
That &apos;s , imagine those pixels could actually start flying .
Can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco ?
You see , we hear a lot about transparency these days .
All of them are victim to injury , illness and violence .

He said , &quot; We farm extensively , not intensively .
There is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers .
The last three of the five , I &apos;ve grouped together .
We have to start making the real world more like a game .
And everyone knew that this is how it functioned , right ?
Clean coal -- you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
I never get to slow down and smell the roses . &quot;
The other was a man I spoke to for about an hour .
Or a musician to get the music out of his head ?
But I would say nothing , and I would seethe inside .
And for me , it becomes necessary to integrate the two .
Finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
And a mother is very uncomfortable for having a girl child .
I &apos;m 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana .

I dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
When I say realism , I mean photo-realism .
Well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds .
The child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities .
And you make amends and you never make that mistake again .
If I start you off easy , I learn how to choose .
But they don &apos;t perceive what happened before as a loss .

We &apos;re looking at some very interesting developments in our work .
Before I close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
So I wear two hats in most of what I do .
I wanted to show you the last project we are working on .
That &apos;s how they communicate -- so run their finger along .
The system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-renewing .
And he &apos;s an economist . So , he &apos;s rational .
Here &apos;s what happened : Not one team had a standing structure .
And we get to re-invent ourselves as often as we like .
If we could overcome this , what that opportunity looks like .
Now , about 20 years ago , all that began to change .

So this is great . This is the digital meeting the physical .
Opossum ? Check . Living ? Yep .
It &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
So those tended to live longer , get expressed more .
And these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid .
Imagine the first piece : a man burning his life &apos;s work .
You see the person puzzled about what was going on inside .
Well today , we know everything about where our objects come from .
Now , I thought , &quot; How could I really capture this ?
That first one , it was more like a passionate affair .
I &apos;m going to keep writing anyway because that &apos;s my job .
One of the coal industry &apos;s ads around Christmas was this one .
We &apos;re not real people . We are there to inspire .

This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
Well , that night , everybody went to celebrate in the center .
So the leading force behind that is the cyber superpower .
Does it apply to others , or does it apply to us ?
We know that money is very important , goals are very important .
So you agree to dig it out when it snows .
In many communities , people had to worry about being lynched .
It &apos;s not like they &apos;re mutually exclusive or anything .
It was called the Automatic Binding Brick .

I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then .
I &apos;ll do it for you , and then I &apos;ll explain it .
superimposed on top of a NASA geospatial image .
Frosty the coal man is a jolly , happy soul .

So why would I out myself and potentially put myself in danger ?
It &apos;s unpredictable -- like this odd country road .
The members of our group came from many different walks of life .
My brand is FedEx because I deliver the goods .
You can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas .
This tool use ability will have applications for smart manufacturing and agriculture .
I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain .
A playful , mindful brand . What is your brand ?
Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set .
How would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them ?
Ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals ?
And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps .
Or this one : &quot; Before you quit , try ! &quot;
To solve this problem , we thought of self-healing materials .
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
In the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
Wealth , not culpability , shapes outcomes .
But that being said , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
So you can ask : How happy is the experiencing self ?
So scientists and engineers , please , talk nerdy to us .
And I believe the key to opening that door is great communication .
It brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch .
The smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world .
I &apos;m not telling you about it because I want to use it .
And the doc says , &quot; But I &apos;m not you . &quot;
But when they go away , so does much of the drinking water .
We &apos;re all born . We all bring our children into the world .
So I think we &apos;re at a kind of impasse here .
The good teams stream it in a way that the players can use .
I &apos;m sure many of you are familiar with Google Glass .
Otherwise , she will be called disobedient .
I &apos;ve got my Gloria Steinem quotes .
Hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
So for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
And those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better .
Storytelling is becoming more and more multi-sensorial .
It was busy , I was in a bit of a hurry .
And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
That &apos;s enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants .
It is Natanz , and it is only Natanz .
Evolution does not necessarily favor the longest-lived .
Our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria .
These are the people who shape the way I look at the world .
So a few years ago , I set off to do just that .
There &apos;s a lot of great books that have been written about this .
It &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
I &apos;m not good enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
You take all that information , and you stream it to your players .
When Kevin came back over , I congratulated him .
My mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat .

Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship .
And that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flashlight .

And if you don &apos;t , someone can steal it from you .
Maybe I didn &apos;t want to be a high-maintenance resident .
It &apos;s the same information . It &apos;s the same number of choices .
This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay .
At the end you want to sustain miserable leftovers .
And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle .
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t put limitations on yourself .
And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience .
I &apos;m sorry , man . Am I freaking you out ?
Something fake becomes something real because of someone &apos;s perception of it .
I &apos;m only showing the top 500 most popular Wikipedia pages right here .
If we overshoot , we can pour a little bit back .
So if I put them next to each other , they get interested .
And you are asked , &quot; Who of them suffered more ? &quot;
&quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; he said .
And yes , I &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see .
So that &apos;s OccupytheSEC movement has done .
Things just can &apos;t possibly keep changing as fast as they are .

The system is so healthy , it purifies the water .
We found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self .
And it was much worse for A than for B , in memory .
They knew all the bits and bites that they had to attack .
I &apos;ve got a picture here of a place in Kentucky .
And we became a family , over a four-and-half year period .
But it is not , by any means , an optimal situation .
So I can step back , pop right back into a specific section .
They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time .
And the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
This opens up the way for you to do science with it .
And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship .
And I was like , &quot; Cool . Bring it . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to live off the grid . &quot;
I was 22 . I had just graduated from Harvard College .

It &apos;s when Italy won the soccer World Cup .
And that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three-month period .
Well I &apos;ve been trying to say something about our criminal justice system .
As we look , we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas .

Evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment .
So , sir , can you help me ? I need help .
You &apos;re going to see the whole thing take place in this movie .

It is actually the true integration of the man and the machine .
He asked Octavio to be his chief of staff .
I no longer try to be right ; I choose to be happy .

Take a good long look : this is today &apos;s clean coal technology .
I grew up in a very small country town in Victoria .
It was a doomsday for my family and for me .
She is not welcomed , neither by father nor by mother .
You just know what it feels like to live in a closet .
I could get them in a worse situation than they were already in .
Oddly , I had been to many of these places before .
Within two weeks , I had 150 people wanting to join in .
And a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow .
Growing one plant will give you 1,000 , 10,000 seeds .
It will make tons of people watch , because people want this experience .
A child in India says , &quot; I saw a monkey today . &quot;
They want to tell their stories . They want to share their stories .
Let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buying a car .
Because it evokes something that in a sense has been lost .
And the first story is about Charles Darwin , one of my heroes .
And he was born looking like a boy -- nobody suspected anything .
The secret is that play is the key to these capacities .
This is the real cool part . It &apos;s called Collections .
Open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
So the next day , just before the event , I called Don .
Well , their experiencing self is not going to get happier .
There are some innovations in nuclear : modular , liquid .
We barely break even . There is no fame in it .
And she said it was like a thunderous train of air .
And what we found was that indeed there was a correlation .
Who hasn &apos;t been low before without suffering from a true mental illness ?
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the brilliance of my daughter .
The only story that matters is the one that you want to write .
These are the guys , they helped me unload the truck .
Gardening is my graffiti . I grow my art .
But then I said , I want to go out with this information .
Conor first physically attacked me five days before our wedding .
And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
We &apos;ve also been taking littleBits to design schools .
Secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
You have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
So we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
And in fact , we &apos;re such a multi-cellular community .
In both cases , they had their operations and they did okay .
People are always upset when I say , &quot; Cut . &quot;
Are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species ?
We don &apos;t inherit an identity ; we get to invent it .
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums .
Well , talking , on its own , only gets you so far .
Suicide from the bridge is neither practical nor probable . &quot;

But where would be the nearest AED to help this patient ?
The greatest fear was of pirates , rape and death .
So we &apos;re seeing this in all sorts of places in human life .
Early afternoon , people here and there , making calls and moving .
This is what we call , in our lab , sensible design .
If you think you look good in something , you almost certainly do .
Now that &apos;s why , for instance , antibiotic resistance has evolved .
If the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
They raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands .
It &apos;s got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to one .
So , with energy , all I could come up with is this .
We can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times .

All of this choice has two effects , two negative effects on people .
It has memories , like scenes from your childhood playing before you .
I called Petaluma police and reported him missing that evening .

We &apos;re trying to end life without parole sentences for children .
That really is my skin . That is not a Hollywood special effect .
I did . The very first picture is a picture of my family .
And more than anything , are you being the best parent you can ?
Now , the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories .
Now , what if that picture links to all of your pictures ?
That &apos;s because there &apos;s never been a good feedback loop in architecture .
You both were on the right path and God will protect her . &quot;
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy .
That &apos;s a lot . Almost everybody today has a mobile phone .
The other question everybody asks is , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?
Also , I realized there was a wide gap between North and South .
Yeah , I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come of this .
And that urgency , that purpose , has really changed my life .
The main problem we have here , it &apos;s kind of like AIDS .
And no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk .
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . Thank you very much .
Turns out though , that that &apos;s not even where it stops .
In the trenches . Richard Turere , you are something else .
And I got in my car and I went to this courthouse .
How do we get to augmented reality , A.R. ?
They &apos;re using their hands to write applications that make government work better .
Last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance .
And so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively .
And how has that been for them ? Has it been successful ?
Well our objects , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
Let &apos;s start by asking : How are we going to feed ourselves ?
Sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
Words , for so long his friends , now mocked him .
What defines a story are changes , significant moments and endings .

So here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
And it felt like technology should enable magic , not kill it .
And we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture .

How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are ?
And they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
Well , unfortunately , the skeptics come in different camps .

I looked at his throat , it was a little bit pink .
He said , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with you ? Have some beer . &quot;
Now in practice they don &apos;t actually test people for their chromosomes .
This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg .
And I &apos;m going to break it down for you for just a second .
Ah , the majority . That makes me feel very good as a doctor .
That &apos;s literally covering just like a two and a half-week period .
Maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e-book .
So the awards were like , &quot; Oh , this is fantastic . &quot;
But augmented reality is not just an enhanced playbook .
Boy , did I have to straighten that one out . &quot;
And this video had actually been posted all the way back in January .
And as soon as I walked inside , the judge saw me coming in .
And I &apos;d go over there and I would , I would just listen .
Now don &apos;t get me wrong here , it didn &apos;t go like this .
It &apos;s creating hyperlinks , if you will , between images .
It &apos;s very gratifying to have this kind of reception here .
There &apos;s some magical amount . I don &apos;t know what it is .
And that was my first time to be acquainted with that .
Obviously , this cannot be done by a human operator .
And one night , there &apos;s a knock at his hotel room door .
So the pinker the belly , the better the system . &quot;
They don &apos;t survive on sunlight-based system the way we do .
It was , &quot; In perpetuity . Forever . &quot;
&quot; Ash , have you ever been to the Castro ? &quot;
I don &apos;t want to say we give up entirely on anatomy .
These results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor .
EMC presents : &quot; Embrace Transparency . &quot;
I sell pet toys all over the country , all over the world .
But it is also the aging population that is multiplying in numbers .
That &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remembering self .
Why am I doing this ? What do I get out of it ? &quot;
On the one hand , it &apos;s a datum that we &apos;re conscious .
I &apos;m learning not that I am luckier than them , though .
Because I believe that we can use augmented reality for something more .
Now this is something that will create massive excitement in the game .
During that time , he shook my hand on three occasions .
&quot; Hi , Kevin . I imagine you &apos;re at the TED Conference .
But most importantly , I met some of my best friends in that community .

Some of my doozies have been in the last five years .
Well it turns out , he didn &apos;t have a strep throat .
So we talk about a 300 , a batter who bats 300 .
I &apos;m going to show you one example of what I &apos;m talking about .
Okay . Anybody who &apos;s ready to take him up on his offer .
And I think that &apos;s the orientation that we have to change .
And I actually believe that the TED community needs to be more courageous .
We &apos;re trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted .
I was giving some lectures in Germany about the death penalty .
Think about this as a pixel , a flying pixel .
It &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been preparing for it our whole lives .
Because when that water leaves , it dumps out into the Atlantic .
I think it &apos;s better if we encourage our great creative minds to live .
And I think it starts with one physician , and that &apos;s me .
I talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill .
&quot; Because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
So how do we operationalize the question of content of character ?
And when they are compromised , then real bad things can happen .
And we often went into just a dead end and had to recover .
The gray boxes that you see , these are real-time control systems .
The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm is actually quite simple .
So there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience .

But it would be worse , except for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when I first started telling people -- when I was a teenager -- that I wanted to be a writer , I was met with this same kind of , sort of fear-based reaction .
And I think mostly in images , and so for me that became a key metric -- how to get these mental images that I use as a way of rapid prototyping , if you will , my ideas , trying on different new ideas for size , playing out scenarios .
Years later , I was on my second teaching round in a Melbourne high school , and I was about 20 minutes into a year 11 legal studies class when this boy put up his hand and said , &quot; Hey miss , when are you going to start doing your speech ? &quot;
And , because I was born without the fibula bones , and had feet turned in , and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that , he had to be the bearer -- this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news .
It also has three big problems : Cost , particularly in highly regulated countries , is high ; the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human operators , that the fuel doesn &apos;t get used for weapons .
Instead , what I do and what the designers at Thinking Machines do is we think at some level of abstraction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much farther and faster than we could ever do .
Actually , my student Thanasis , I have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy .
This is was the problem : transparency -- free from pretense or deceit ; easily detected or seen through ; readily understood ; characterized by visibility or accessibility of information , especially concerning business practices -- that last line being probably the biggest problem .
So I take a deep breath and I look down and staring back at me is a four-year-old girl in a pink dress , not a challenge to a feminist duel , just a kid with a question : &quot; Are you a boy or are you a girl ? &quot;
I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa , but then I saw what the Americans were doing , what the English were doing , what the French were doing , and after seeing what they were doing , I became quite proud of our project in Zambia .
But when I was on the phone with him , asking why he was going to do this surgery -- this was a very high-risk surgery -- his answer was that , in this other nation , these children were going to be treated very badly , and so he had to do this .
And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; Well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; And I say , &quot; Great , let &apos;s make that language Yoruba . Let &apos;s make it Cantonese .
Over 85 percent of abusers are men , and domestic abuse happens only in intimate , interdependent , long-term relationships , in other words , in families , the last place we would want or expect to find violence , which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing .
And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere , and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations , intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness .
Now if you take this picture -- I &apos;m Italian originally , and every boy in Italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom -- but the reason I &apos;m showing you this is that something very interesting happened in Formula 1 racing over the past couple of decades .
We traced genealogies back eight generations , and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it , they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we speared him anyway .
As we did some of our subsequent expeditions , I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that I had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them .
So what happens in &quot; The Greatest Movie Ever Sold , &quot; is that everything from top to bottom , from start to finish , is branded from beginning to end -- from the above-the-title sponsor that you &apos;ll see in the movie , which is brand X .
So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms , a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land , a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in , to go live under those rules or not .
Because there are no vultures , there &apos;s been a spread in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites , and when you have feral dogs , you have a huge time bomb of rabies . The number of cases of rabies has increased tremendously in India .
I went to school , I got good marks , I had a very low-key after school job in my mum &apos;s hairdressing salon , and I spent a lot of time watching &quot; Buffy the Vampire Slayer &quot; and &quot; Dawson &apos;s Creek . &quot;
The coolest thing about this -- and this is what &apos;s completing the whole circle -- is that in April of this year , at the Geffen MOCA in downtown Los Angeles , there &apos;s going to be an exhibition called &quot; Art of the Streets . &quot;
Alex Wissner-Gross : So what you &apos;ve just seen is that a variety of signature human intelligent cognitive behaviors such as tool use and walking upright and social cooperation all follow from a single equation , which drives a system to maximize its future freedom of action .
And this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be captain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explosion , doubled demand and things like that .
So my theory is that when you apply media to this pendulum , it starts swinging faster and faster , until it &apos;s at both extremes nearly simultaneously , and that effectively blurs the difference between innovation and symbol , between us , the architects , and you , the public .
And it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience I &apos;ve ever had , because I would know before I turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it , because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
Over the next few weeks , I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where I felt alone , isolated , not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues .
So whereas the fathers were extremely attentive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept , what we would have is more of a concept of , not just how to protect , but how to care for each other .
Additionally , that very few who have jumped off the bridge and lived and can talk about it , that one to two percent , most of those folks have said that the second that they let go of that rail , they knew that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live .
So , she &apos;s running to the house and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the poem passes through her , and she grabs a pencil just as it &apos;s going through her , and then she said , it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it .
Even still , he has a dream that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activists like Free the Slaves , and it &apos;s this sort of determination , in the face of unimaginable odds , that fills me with complete awe .
And in a miracle , he lifted his own violin and he started playing , by ear , certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete -- Mendelssohn , Tchaikovsky , Sibelius .
He said to me , &quot; I had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence , and you &apos;ve been making liar out of me ever since . &quot;
The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water , responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living , so that for that brief shining moment , the acolyte becomes the god .
He said , &quot; When we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an orientation of the spirit , a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and be a witness . &quot;
What if you could change the sperm and the ova , or change the newly fertilized egg , and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life -- eliminate the diabetes , eliminate the hemophilia , reduce the risk of cancer ?
If we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility -- or potency , to be even a little bit more dangerous -- we can release the power of so many more children , and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
And this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video &apos;s really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play -- such as testicles -- and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust -- while at the same time being tremendous fun .
I &apos;m a historian by training , and what I study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy -- meaning human bodies , animal bodies -- how they dealt with bodily fluids , concepts of bodies ; how have they thought about bodies .
I have talked about four techniques for mitigating the problem of choice overload -- cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives ; concretize -- make it real ; categorize -- we can handle more categories , less choices ; condition for complexity .
In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter , I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale , but I &apos;m also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis .
The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution , and , even in the 1900s we &apos;ve seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air-conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
There are the New World vultures that are mainly found in the Americas , like the condors and the caracaras , and then the Old World vultures , where we have 16 species . From these 16 , 11 of them are facing a high risk of extinction .
I was 22 , and in the United States , women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages , and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners , boyfriends , and husbands in the United States .
In my 20 years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism , I &apos;ve made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors to learn everything I can , from one of the first articles I wrote for the Toronto Star to my show &quot; White Coat , Black Art . &quot;
But in our game , instead of just having five people on the dream team , we said , &quot; Everybody &apos;s on the dream team , and it &apos;s your job to invent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of health , the future of security and the future of the social safety net . &quot;
If you should ever have the chance to staff your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow Scott Silverman did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an opossum stuck in your house .
We &apos;ve been working with Roberto Bolle , one of today &apos;s top ballet dancers -- the √©toile at Metropolitan in New York and La Scala in Milan -- and actually captured his movement in 3D in order to use it as an input for Flyfire .
But the process , and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie , the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble , and released it kind of back where it came from , and realized that this didn &apos;t have to be this internalized , tormented thing .
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grandest challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we don &apos;t know about it and understand it , then the work isn &apos;t done , and I believe it &apos;s our responsibility as non-scientists to have these interactions .
I hope that these images awaken a force in those who view them , people like you , and I hope that force will ignite a fire , and that fire will shine a light on slavery , for without that light , the beast of bondage can continue to live in the shadows .
I believe a significant -- not the only , but a significant -- contributor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they &apos;re at fault .
Like the others , I wear a flickering , cheap flashlight tied to my head with this elastic , tattered band , and I can barely make out the slick tree limbs holding up the walls of the three-foot square hole dropping hundreds of feet into the earth .
And I think that there &apos;s theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with RNA , but I &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them .
It &apos;s Friday , Friday . Gotta get down on Friday . Everybody &apos;s looking forward to the weekend , weekend . Friday , Friday . Gettin &apos; down on Friday . So you didn &apos;t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope .
And you know , that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever I wasn &apos;t in school I was out in the woods , hiking and taking &quot; samples &quot; -- frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water -- and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscope .
People in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , &quot; Well yeah , that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there &apos;s a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be bleeding .
Now , I may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appetite I have for consuming memories , but even if you do more of this , there is a genuine question : Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
They are constructions , and they are constructions by a group of professionals , by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production , and they build this . That &apos;s not me .
So what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes , the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable anatomical categories that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fuzzy than we thought .
And we were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist , trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses that were totally internalized .
Now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . FoxP2 , for example .
Now , all these photos had been damaged by water , submerged in salt water , covered in bacteria , in sewage , sometimes even in oil , all of which over time is going to continue to damage them , so hand-cleaning them was a huge part of the project .
Now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full percentage , that will be very tricky , and agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard , but the toughest one here is this long-term issue .
The reason is that they &apos;re getting poisoned , and the reason that they &apos;re getting poisoned is because there &apos;s human-wildlife conflicts . The pastoral communities are using this poison to target predators , and in return , the vultures are falling victim to this .
If I show you 600 magazines and I divide them up into 10 categories , versus I show you 400 magazines and divide them up into 20 categories , you believe that I have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if I gave you the 400 than if I gave you the 600 .
And she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her , she could collect it and grab it on the page .
And if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experiencing self of Patient A worse off , and you have the remembering self of Patient A a lot better off , because now you have endowed Patient A with a better story about his experience .
If we take a look back at the history of how intelligence has been viewed , one seminal example has been Edsger Dijkstra &apos;s famous quote that &quot; the question of whether a machine can think is about as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim . &quot;
And , one day , he came in to my session -- exhaustive and unforgiving , these sessions -- and he said to me , &quot; Wow . Aimee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , I think you &apos;re going to break one of those bands .
The main reason for this is because , we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls of mayonnaises , mustards , vinegars , jams , but we can &apos;t actually do the math of comparing and contrasting and actually picking from that stunning display .
What you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to take all the CO2 , after you &apos;ve burned it , going out the flue , pressurize it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it stays there .
But in fact , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those extraneous redundant options , well there &apos;s an increase in sales , there &apos;s a lowering of costs , there is an improvement of the choosing experience .
Nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder , but while serving time on lesser charges , he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen New York City landmarks , including tunnels , synagogues and the United Nations headquarters .
But today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick , elastic bands -- different colors , you know -- to help build up my leg muscles , and I hated these bands more than anything -- I hated them , had names for them . I hated them .
But we did get 17 brand partners who were willing to relinquish that control , who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn &apos;t be able to tell -- stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind .
But we don &apos;t even blink when we hear somebody say this because we &apos;ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we &apos;ve completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry , in the end , will always ultimately lead to anguish .
Take your science , subtract your bullet points and your jargon , divide by relevance , meaning share what &apos;s relevant to the audience , and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you &apos;re doing , and that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding .
So , I wrote this piece called &quot; Avatar , &quot; which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects , of CG effects , beyond , with realistic human emotive characters generated in CG , and the main characters would all be in CG , and the world would be in CG .
My equivalent of that statement to pass on to descendants to help them build artificial intelligences or to help them understand human intelligence , is the following : Intelligence should be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid constraints in its own future .
As I looked through the photos , there were some were over a hundred years old , some still in the envelope from the processing lab , I couldn &apos;t help but think as a retoucher that I could fix that tear and mend that scratch , and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same .
And other times she wouldn &apos;t be fast enough , so she &apos;d be running and running and running , and she wouldn &apos;t get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape , looking , as she put it &quot; for another poet . &quot;
In our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or , indeed , a prognosis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don &apos;t put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable someone .
You know , genocide , the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned , but ethnocide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not condemned , it &apos;s universally , in many quarters , celebrated as part of a development strategy .
Pretend that you &apos;re an alien race that doesn &apos;t know anything about Earth biology or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence , but you have amazing telescopes and you &apos;re able to watch the Earth , and you have amazingly long lives , so you &apos;re able to watch the Earth over millions , even billions of years .
In fact , most of my career , I &apos;ve been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging , that make them interesting , that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience .
In fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not , and so it &apos;s through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that , yes , with the right material &apos;s approach , this looks like it would work .
To actually do the software , buy the supercomputer , hire all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
Those may make some contribution , and if they can do better than I expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look daunting , because they all have significant challenges .
He doesn &apos;t remember if he stole my chocolate bar , but he remembers the year of release for every song on my iPod , conversations we had when he was four , weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of Teletubbies , and Lady Gaga &apos;s birthday .
So L.A. Times got ahold of it . Steve Lopez did a story on it and talked to the councilman , and one of the Green Grounds members , they put up a petition on Change.org , and with 900 signatures , we were a success .
I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep , the three of us still in the same bed .
And that &apos;s that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the DMV and all those other things that we &apos;re really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of Tim O &apos;Reilly , &quot; What we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
The Neolithic Revolution -- which gave us agriculture , at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed ; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood ; we created hierarchy specialization surplus -- is only 10,000 years ago .
But unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the runway , every single one that was hired , and of the 677 models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non-white .
However , if you take a look back and think about what have been the most empowering innovations that enabled us to build artificial machines that swim and artificial machines that &#91; fly &#93; , you find that it was only through understanding the underlying physical mechanisms of swimming and flight that we were able to build these machines .
These guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
And what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been deployed all across the world -- that &apos;s a cellphone network -- and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network , that &apos;s collected anyway by the operator , in order to understand how the city works .
I mean , we &apos;re all assigned gender at birth , so what I &apos;m trying to do is to have this conversation that sometimes that gender assignment doesn &apos;t match , and there should be a space that would allow people to self-identify , and that &apos;s a conversation that we should have with parents , with colleagues .
There &apos;s always one continent left out , the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs . Well , of course , they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era .
So what that means is that people will be able to ‚Äî People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .
So you see these astonishing demonstrations : Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity , a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation .
I encourage all of you to read Steve &apos;s book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bond , and ultimately was instrumental -- if you &apos;ll pardon the pun -- in helping Nathaniel get off the streets .
What if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down , so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next , we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
And finally , I believe that , despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating , we will ultimately not be judged by our technology , we won &apos;t be judged by our design , we won &apos;t be judged by our intellect and reason .
However , there are 6.3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with incurable weakness , tremor , rigidity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Other outcomes include long-term stalking , even after the abuser remarries ; denial of financial resources ; and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children , who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother .
So we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes , in bars , and your dedicated buddies who will do to you , what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic , somebody who will say to you , &quot; What do you need ?
But with only one company , one agency willing to help me -- and that &apos;s only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years -- I realized that I would have to go on my own , I &apos;d have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team .
You know , one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stones polished by rain , taste it in the bitter leaves of plants .
Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia , in the wake of the conquest , these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain .
Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a question-and-answer session after one of my lectures reported a story , He said he &apos;d been listening to a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording , there was a dreadful screeching sound .
When I was working in the field , I brought lots of candles with me , and with the help of my interpreter , I imparted to the people I was photographing that I wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight , so when it was safe for them , and safe for me , I made these images .
Up attributes are things like being playful , being fresh like the Fresh Prince , contemporary , adventurous , edgy or daring like Errol Flynn , nimble or agile , profane , domineering , magical or mystical like Gandalf .
I made this last year , and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community , so my civic center colleagues and I made a tool kit , and now walls have been made in countries around the world , including Kazakhstan , South Africa , Australia , Argentina and beyond .
But since publishing &quot; Crazy Love , &quot; I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out , who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened , and who rebuilt lives -- joyous , happy lives -- as employees , wives and mothers , lives completely free of violence , like me .
And , as I &apos;ve been looking over the last year for models for how to do that I &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and I &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people , sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity .
So actually , the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our healing machine -- this is the big version we have made to go on the real road -- if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road , which of course saves a lot of money .
If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects : the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the indirect effects , in that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adjust to these rapid changes , and so you get ecosystem collapses .
Porous asphalt , a material that we use now in most of the highways in the Netherlands , it has pores and water can just rain through it , so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides , and you have a road that &apos;s easy to drive on , so no splash water anymore .
Now , I don &apos;t know if this theory is right , but it &apos;s actually perhaps the leading theory right now in the science of consciousness , and it &apos;s been used to integrate a whole range of scientific data , and it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough you can write it on the front of a t-shirt .
And then the Renaissance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was let &apos;s put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine .
So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi and Alessandro Previtero , we did a study with people at ING -- employees that are all working at ING -- and now these people were all in a session where they &apos;re doing enrollment for their 401 plan .
As we started down the path , we pushed aside the vines blocking the way , and after about an hour of walking in , found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains , so I hoisted the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest .
So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
With an amazing group of women , I co-founded the Libyan Women &apos;s Platform for Peace , a movement of women , leaders , from different walks of life , to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace .
And since then , I &apos;ve conducted about 70 design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects , even the CTOs of the Fortune 50 , and there &apos;s something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and I &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book , this memoir called &quot; Eat , Pray , Love &quot; which , decidedly unlike any of my previous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , mega-sensation , international bestseller thing .
Another example : a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old , who was born a boy , raised a boy , had a girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside .
And the insight of President Lobo was that that assurance of enforcement that I was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust .
I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing , it was so ludicrous , but I &apos;d just gotten past &quot; mangled , &quot; and my voice broke , and I had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed .
I have five sisters , and none of them could go to school , and you will be astonished , two weeks before , when I was filling out the Canadian visa form , and I was filling out the family part of the form , I could not recall the surnames of some of my sisters .
The great 20th-century geneticist , T.G. Dobzhansky , who was also a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Church , once wrote an essay that he titled &quot; Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution . &quot;
But if you &apos;re an alien race who doesn &apos;t know any of this , doesn &apos;t have any concept of Earth intelligence , you &apos;d be forced to put together a physical theory that explains how , up until a certain point in time , asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet mysteriously stop doing that .
This building was already a part of this community , and then that first summer , when people started arriving and sharing the building on social media , the building ceased to be just an edifice and it became media , because these , these are not just pictures of a building , they &apos;re your pictures of a building .
Well , to conclude , I can say that we made a material using steel fibers , the addition of steel fibers , using induction energy to really increase the surface life of the road , double the surface life you can even do , so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks .
you know , when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses , at the end it said that he took the hammer , threw it at the Moses -- actually you can still see a small chip underneath -- and said , shouted , &quot; Perch√© non parli ? Why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
The second is media and celebrity culture , then how to handle teasing and bullying , the way we compete and compare with one another based on looks , talking about appearance ‚Äî some people call this &quot; body talk &quot; or &quot; fat talk &quot; ‚Äî and finally , the foundations of respecting and looking after yourself .
Even though he held those loaded guns to my head , pushed me down stairs , threatened to kill our dog , pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway , poured coffee grinds on my head as I dressed for a job interview , I never once thought of myself as a battered wife .
And I was afraid , not for myself , but I was afraid that I was going to lose him , that he was going to sink into one of his states , and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin if I started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy .
Here he &apos;s seen taking a bath at the well , pouring big buckets of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are sitting here talking today , Kofi has been reunited with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe .
And I wound up getting involved with the space community , really involved with NASA , sitting on the NASA advisory board , planning actual space missions , going to Russia , going through the pre-cosmonaut biomedical protocols , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3D camera systems .
In South Asia , in countries like India and Pakistan , four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered , which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct , and the reason is because they are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a painkilling drug like Diclofenac .
What I &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as I can , is some foundational work , some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago . This is Seadragon , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data .
But as a result now , he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes , the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding and then disappearing for days , wandering the streets of Skid Row , exposed to its horrors , with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him .
A few days after Malala was born , my daughter was born , my cousin came -- and it was a coincidence -- he came to my home and he brought a family tree , a family tree of the Yousafzai family , and when I looked at the family tree , it traced back to 300 years of our ancestors .
The human ability to adapt , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity , and I &apos;m going to make an admission : This phrase never sat right with me , and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and I think I &apos;m starting to figure out why .
Well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . Now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
And if you would choose a different vacation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in terms of memories , you might get another answer .
Enveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees , men , women , children , entire families in fact , were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust , while mechanically stacking bricks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and carrying them from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away .
Unfortunately after you &apos;ve gone to school , and you have a r√©sum√© and you &apos;ve done a few jobs , you can &apos;t say anything anymore , so if you say you want to be the President of the United States , but your r√©sum√© reads , &quot; Underwear Model : 10 years , &quot; people give you a funny look .
175 salad dressings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 extra-virgin olive oils and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings , in the off-chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you .
He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series , all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of Beethoven &apos;s Fourth Symphony .
Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape , we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the &quot; noble savage , &quot; which is an idea racist in its simplicity , or alternatively , we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are .
If I were to walk into a room filled with my colleages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what I &apos;ve just told you right now , I probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable , somebody would crack a joke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .
They believed that a genius was this , sort of magical divine entity , who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio , kind of like Dobby the house elf , and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work .
So by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic defects like depth of field , desaturated colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
But my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the CO2 constraints , then the skeptics say , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out CO2 , I kind of wish it did put out CO2 , but I guess I &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than what &apos;s come before . &quot;
I decided when I was 27 years old to only respond to people , and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation , where you never initiate anything , you never motivate anybody , but you become a servant of the local passion , the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person .
You know that healthy kind , when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then your best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions , but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say , I &apos;ll never make that mistake again .
I mean , most of the moments of our life -- and I calculated , you know , the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 600,000 -- most of them don &apos;t leave a trace .
I know a family of seven sisters and one brother , and that one brother , he has migrated to the Gulf countries , to earn a living for his seven sisters and parents , because he thinks that it will be humiliating if his seven sisters learn a skill and they go out of the home and earn some livelihood .
If I can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about information overload , what I &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible .
Several years ago , I was working at the South Side Walnut Cafe , a local diner in town , and during my time there I would go through phases of militant lesbian intensity : not shaving my armpits , quoting Ani DiFranco lyrics as gospel .
In the 19th century , Maxwell figured out that you can &apos;t explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of the existing fundamentals ‚Äî space , time , mass , Newton &apos;s laws ‚Äî so he postulated fundamental laws of electromagnetism and postulated electric charge as a fundamental element that those laws govern .
And he &apos;s speeding along , and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of melody , that comes into his head as inspiration often comes , elusive and tantalizing , and he wants it , you know , it &apos;s gorgeous , and he longs for it , but he has no way to get it .
It is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose , then the one that chooses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be chosen .
Due to weathering , due to U.V. light , due to oxidation , this binder , this bitumen , the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink , and if it shrinks , it gets micro-cracks , and it delaminates from the aggregates .
In this picture , I &apos;ve put a bush with a center branching out in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms : it has survived ; it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment .
We have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion , the energy and imagination of your own people .
But I &apos;m also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it &apos;s great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I &apos;d had more agency in my career , because maybe then I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I got my first job , or maybe I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I paid for college , which seems so important right now .
So with help from old and new friends , I turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chalkboard and stenciled it with a fill-in-the-blank sentence : &quot; Before I die , I want to ... &quot; So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk , reflect on their lives , and share their personal aspirations in public space .
And the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy , &quot; which makes it sound like a good thing , but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision-making from somebody who knows something -- namely , the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions -- namely , the patient .
I &apos;m wondering what you would say , especially to parents , but in a more broad way , to friends , to family , to anyone who finds themselves encountering a child or a person who is struggling with and uncomfortable with a gender that &apos;s being assigned them , what might you say to the family members of that person to help them become good and caring and kind family members to them ?
So from 15 to 17 years old , I joined the most prestigious pageant to the pageant where it &apos;s at the back of the truck , literally , or sometimes it would be a pavement next to a rice field , and when it rains -- it rains a lot in the Philippines -- the organizers would have to move it inside someone &apos;s house .
And so , that would be your response to the Bjorn Lomborg argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth , it &apos;s a stupid waste of the Earth &apos;s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
Because I usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and I thought that , since I was among friends here , I would tell you what I really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it .
So when I was writing this talk , I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance , because on the one hand , I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say , &quot; Look I &apos;ve received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor , &quot; and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with , &quot; and it doesn &apos;t always make me happy . &quot;
No biologists , for example , would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity -- scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity .
Curious historical footnote -- when the Moors invaded southern Spain , they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; to &quot; Ol√© , ol√© , ol√© , &quot; which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances .
And so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of , say , coal , and so -- if you can deal with the negatives , which are essentially the radiation -- the footprint and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment , and I got frustrated , and Conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream , and he used the chokehold to hit my head repeatedly against the wall .
And I helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany for 60 cents a kilo , but we found a way to take the fish for sushi to Japan for 15 dollars a kilo , and the farmers came to talk to me , said , &quot; Hey , you helped them . Can you help us ? &quot;
This idea , it saved me when I was in the middle of writing &quot; Eat , Pray , Love , &quot; and I fell into one of those , sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , this is going to be the worst book ever written .
The computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots -- all taken near Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- all these shots were taken . So you see elements here of stabilized slide-show or panoramic imaging , and these things have all been related spatially .
Just a week ago , the National Academy of Engineering awarded its Draper Prize to Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer , two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way -- what Frances Arnold calls &quot; directed evolution . &quot;
In turn , the word &quot; raheem , &quot; which is known in all Abrahamic traditions , has the same root in Arabic as the word &quot; rahem &quot; -- womb -- symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity from which the male and the female , from which all tribes , all peoples , have emanated from .
A couple of years ago , the Lasker Prize was awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell , a fibroblast , and by manipulating just four genes , he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell -- a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body .
That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw and the Crooked Beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world , spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation .
Finally , Richard Feynman , famous physicist , once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed and you could pass only a single concept on to our descendants to help them rebuild civilization , that concept should be that all matter around us is made out of tiny elements that attract each other when they &apos;re far apart but repel each other when they &apos;re close together .
So I went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this , and we were like , &quot; Well wait a second . If we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things , why don &apos;t we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser and he could do graf again ? Well that would be awesome . &quot;
And , to dimensionalize this , I went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made -- for cars , for computers , for phones , for flashlights , for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses , and what I found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone , who &apos;s now in her 90s , but she &apos;s been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia , she would be out working in the fields , and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape .
Now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this -- something that monitors the car in real time , has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car , transmitting this information into the system , and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected .
This equation has four factors , a little bit of multiplication : So , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , CO2 , that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the services each person &apos;s using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy .
You know , I think that allowing somebody , one mere person to believe that he or she is like , the vessel , you know , like the font and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , unknowable , eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile , human psyche .
Now , of course , this was a simple ploy on Dr. P &apos;s part to get me to do the exercises I didn &apos;t want to do before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward , but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me .
The older ladies sometimes hadn &apos;t seen a scanner before , but within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo , they could give it to us , have it scanned , uploaded to a cloud server , it would be downloaded by a gaijin , a stranger , somewhere on the other side of the globe , and it &apos;d start being fixed .
In the early &apos; 80s , I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti , infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier &apos;s strength and Tonton Macoutes , and securing the poison used to make zombies .
Well , we haven &apos;t picked a particular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear , &quot; so we &apos;ve got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in Russia , India , China -- I &apos;ve been back seeing the secretary of energy here , talking about how this fits into the energy agenda .
It means that a young kid from the Andes who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined .
So , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea , so I &apos;ll say it again , let it sink in : If we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , obesity , I believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade .
I &apos;d like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth-century Persian poet named Hafiz that my friend , Jacques Dembois told me about , and the poem is called &quot; The God Who Only Knows Four Words &quot; : &quot; Every child has known God , not the God of names , not the God of don &apos;ts , but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them , saying , &apos; Come dance with me .
What happened was women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the Founding Fathers &apos; concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and said , &quot; The fact that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn &apos;t have the right to vote , the right to full citizenship , the right to own property , etc . , etc . &quot;
So if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice HMI , and the client says , &quot; Cameron , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
That &apos;s right , some lucky individual , corporation , for-profit or non-profit , was going to get the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity -- because I &apos;m sure Chris Anderson will never let it happen again -- to buy the naming rights to the talk you &apos;re watching right now , that at the time didn &apos;t have a title , didn &apos;t really have a lot of content and didn &apos;t really give much hint as to what the subject matter would actually be .
And I &apos;m telling a story that many of you know , because Steve &apos;s columns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez , and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers , the Juilliard-trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia .
And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us by confessing his secret , which was that , as a very young boy starting at age four , he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather , and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade , even though he was very smart , and he &apos;d spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life .
Implicit in this phrase of &quot; overcoming adversity &quot; is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience , as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics , or what other people perceive as my disability .
I could go back to my girlfriend and my gay-loving table and mock their responses , chastise their unworldliness and their inability to jump through the politically correct gay hoops I had brought with me , or I could empathize with them and realize that that was maybe one of the hardest things they had ever done , that starting and having that conversation was them coming out of their closets .
Now we teach entrepreneurship to 16-year-olds in Northumberland , and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson &apos;s autobiography , and the task of the 16-year-olds is to underline , in the first two pages of Richard Branson &apos;s autobiography how many times Richard uses the word &quot; I &quot; and how many times he uses the word &quot; we . &quot;
If somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are , then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data , and I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space , into that meta-verse , using everybody else &apos;s photos , and do a kind of a cross-modal and cross-user social experience that way .
The young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years : two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s womb ; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother .
And yet , in this country , in the states of the Old South , we execute people -- where you &apos;re 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white -- in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched .
We proposed a building that was audacious , that was different than any of the forms that the community was used to , and we were scared and our client was scared and the community was scared , so we created a series of photorealistic renderings that we put onto Facebook and we put onto Instagram , and we let people start to do what they do : share it , comment , like it , hate it .
I led an initiative by the Libyan Women &apos;s Platform for Peace to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law , a law that would give every citizen , no matter what your background , the right to vote and run , and most importantly to stipulate on political parties the alternation of male and female candidates vertically and horizontally in their lists , creating the zipper list .
On my show , on &quot; White Coat , Black Art , &quot; I made it a habit of saying , &quot; Here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; I would say to everybody from paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery , &quot; Here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; What about yours ? &quot; and I would point the microphone towards them .
So the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fosters in a loving , supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mistakes , we &apos;re rewarded for coming clean .
In fact , I used to argue with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes -- who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s -- I used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hallucination .
And Ms. Parks used to come back to Montgomery every now and then , and she would get together with two of her dearest friends , these older women , Johnnie Carr who was the organizer of the Montgomery bus boycott -- amazing African-American woman -- and Virginia Durr , a white woman , whose husband , Clifford Durr , represented Dr. King .
I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague , and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes , 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution .
You observe that , over the course of the millennia , Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids up until a point , and that at some point , corresponding roughly to our year , 2000 AD , asteroids that are on a collision course with the Earth that otherwise would have collided mysteriously get deflected or they detonate before they can hit the Earth .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from Flickr . You just type Notre Dame into Flickr , and you get some pictures of guys in t-shirts , and of the campus and so on . And each of these orange cones represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model .
I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so petrified , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere , and abolitionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own , so that now they do the same back-breaking work , but they do it for themselves , and they get paid for it , and they do it in freedom .
If you had told me that this smart , funny , sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup , how short my skirts were , where I lived , what jobs I took , who my friends were and where I spent Christmas , I would have laughed at you , because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in Conor at the beginning .
Just as some animals can use objects in their environments as tools to reach into narrow spaces , here we see that Entropica , again on its own initiative , was able to move a large disk representing an animal around so as to cause a small disk , representing a tool , to reach into a confined space holding a third disk and release the third disk from its initially fixed position .
Ladies and gentlemen , this plight of millions of women could be changed if we think differently , if women and men think differently , if men and women in the tribal and patriarchal societies in the developing countries , if they can break a few norms of family and society , if they can abolish the discriminatory laws of the systems in their states , which go against the basic human rights of the women .
Now we all , or a big part of us , use Gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran , where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections , so the local government can &apos;t snoop on their discussions .
Now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid , take out your personal communications device -- I give you permission -- and perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz &apos;s book on being wrong , because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you .
And we know it &apos;s hard but we need you out here , no matter what your walls are made of , because I guarantee you there are others peering through the keyholes of their closets looking for the next brave soul to bust a door open , so be that person and show the world that we are bigger than our closets and that a closet is no place for a person to truly live .
I would like to jump straight to one of Noah &apos;s original data-sets -- and this is from an early prototype of Photosynth that we first got working in the summer -- to show you what I think is really the punch line behind this technology , the Photosynth technology . And it &apos;s not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments that we &apos;ve put up on the website .
Margaret Mead , the great anthropologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities .
And so , when you have all sorts of urgent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later , and a somewhat uncertain pain thing -- in fact , the IPCC report , that &apos;s not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say , &quot; OK , that isn &apos;t that big of a deal . &quot;
Now let &apos;s take a step back in time to the Big Bang , 14 billion years ago -- the Earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years -- the first signs of proto-life , maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth -- the first multi-celled organisms , perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species , finally emerging in the last 130,000 years .
And what we &apos;re doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradually , one by one , the central revelation of anthropology : that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being .
And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo , or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti , or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya , the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes , or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara -- this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma , Everest , the goddess mother of the world .

At one point , Javier said to Octavio , &quot; What if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an embassy -- give some to the U.S. embassy ; give some to the Canadian embassy -- and then if people want to go work under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States , they can go get jobs , do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do ? &quot;
And at the end of this amazing initiation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sunrise . And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory . And the priest steps back and says , &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you .
Instead , Conor came home one Friday evening and he told me that he had quit his job that day , his dream job , and he said that he had quit his job because of me , because I had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn &apos;t need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore , and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive , dysfunctional family , and move to a tiny town in New England where he could start his life over with me by his side .
One of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , you know , what salad dressing is ? -- it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better . And what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made , and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made , even if it was a good decision .
There &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet , but they have , nevertheless , through time and ritual , forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it , but on a far subtler intuition : the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness .
I will leave the final word to an English scientist , Humphrey Davy , who , I suspect , when defending his protege &apos;s useless experiments -- his protege was Michael Faraday -- said this , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our triumphs are complete , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . &quot;
So , as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects -- along with my adviser Pattie , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi -- I started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop , what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically , arranging it the way we wanted ?
How can I speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations , about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four-year-old girl huddled with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea more than 30 years ago , bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today ?
The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood , whether winning a second grade spelling bee , marching with the Girl Scouts , you know , the Halloween parade , winning my college scholarship , or any of my sports victories , and he was using it , and integrating it into teaching resident students , med students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School .
And so what I did in Esperance that first year was to just walk the streets , and in three days I had my first client , and I helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage , was a Maori guy , and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth , to get organized , and then the fishermen came to me to say , &quot; You the guy who helped Maori ? Can you help us ? &quot;
When you come back to the shore and you say , &quot; We had to do this , and the fiber optic , and the attentuation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the difficulty , the human-performance aspects of working at sea , &quot; you can &apos;t explain it to people . It &apos;s that thing that maybe cops have , or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
Certainly , from a medical standpoint , my legs , laser surgery for vision impairment , titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them -- not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self-identify , to claim their own descriptions of themselves , so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing .
Now , Conor did not come home one day and announce , &quot; You know , hey , all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great , but I need to move into the next phase where I isolate you and I abuse you &quot; ‚Äî ‚Äî &quot; so I need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scream and out of this city where you have friends and family and coworkers who can see the bruises . &quot;
Wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away ; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to : whether it &apos;s the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan -- a nomadic people from Southeast Asia , from Sarawak -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers , where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away to the South China Sea , where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest -- or , in the case of the Yanomami , it &apos;s the disease entities that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
The oil shortage is fictional , but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve run out of oil . So when you come to the game , you sign up , you tell us where you live , and then we give you real-time news , videos , data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs , what &apos;s not available , how food supply is being affected , how transportation is being affected , if schools are closed , if there is rioting , and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true . And then we ask you to blog about it , to post videos , to post photos .
For some time I have been interested in the placebo effect , which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that I do , which is , &quot; Something fake is believed in enough by somebody In other words , sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies , the placebo effect , just because the person thinks that what &apos;s happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a -- for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way , or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning , or that in the Himalaya , the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma , is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made , albeit successfully , many generations ago .
What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation , but the elaboration of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines , harmine , harmaline , mildly hallucinogenic -- to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness -- but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis .
And it means that a building doesn &apos;t have to be beautiful to be lovable , like this ugly little building in Spain , where the architects dug a hole , packed it with hay , and then poured concrete around it , and when the concrete dried , they invited someone to come and clean that hay out so that all that &apos;s left when it &apos;s done is this hideous little room that &apos;s filled with the imprints and scratches of how that place was made , and that becomes the most sublime place to watch a Spanish sunset .
