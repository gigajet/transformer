the most striking example comes from hungary , where prime minister viktor orban demanded the repeal of the decrees adopted in 1945 by president edvard bene benes ( decrees which confiscated the property of the german and hungarian populations from czechoslovakia during this period and which remove their citizenship ) in the context of a reelection campaign which did not result in a fair election .

the fact that orban was supported by the stoiber requirements has been seen as a gift of the skies from the slovak nationalist nationalist meciar in his new attempt to become a prime minister , because it allowed him to say that his national opponents were prepared to give in to the pressure of the european union and to force slovakia to compensate the hungarian refugees by benes in 1945 .
