human rights are a more difficult issue than formal procedures , because human rights are not regarded as &apos; rights &apos; in the legal sense , but rather as a kind of conscience or a gift that is distributed in exchange for something equivalent .

however , it is certain that the vacuum that has left sharks out of politics is all the more remarkable in the light of the flagrant images of the chaos and the collapse of the palestinian authority , which we are seeing from the gaza strip of israel .
in developing countries , we are afraid that capital controls could allow capital flows of money that are needed for industrialisation , and that is also because some of the money flow through the hands of a heated home of the deputy finance minister .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it was by chance that mr glenmin , a friend bernnas , particularly in a research laboratory in uppa , where a great pepsinal had been made available to everyone , and some of them were still in the motives of cameras .
the palestinian leadership could also take the difficult path to explain to the refugees that they will not return to israel - contrary to the 50-year-old palestinian propaganda - but will have to be located in the west bank and gaza in the gaza strip , the regions that will become part of the final palestinian state .
on the israeli side , another withdrawal from dozens of isolated and small settlements in the west bank would be politically feasible , which would be linked to the relocation of 20 000 to 30 000 settlers , which would enable the palestinians to receive a border area in the west bank .
the problem is that economic and social reforms are only the only ones in the area of responsibility of individual states and not in the area of competence of the union ; if there are economic and social reforms in france and germany , that is only a matter for french and german voters and politicians .
unlike europe and russia , china is not ( like europe ) part of a alliances or ( like russia ) in a system of arms control treaties , which can develop political solutions : these factors contribute to indifference in asia and to chinese sensitivities .

the eu &apos;s enlargement is short and the community mission must not be poisoned by the supporters of the old and &apos; other &apos; europe , by politicians who , rather than thinking about how to create a peaceful and prosperous europe .

therefore , john paul ii is not an enthusiastic supporter of modern western culture , which has already been adopted by the world of values , and this western culture provides the moral sensitivities of those societies in which the memory of decades of dictatorship is still fresh .
we have noted that the media are not only failing to play off bad concepts , but that they are , in fact , often giving them the advantage - especially if the truth is too vague , in the sense that they could be presented in good ppings .
these countries , with the greatest concern for the southern european countries , italy and greece , have usually had a huge relationship between debt and gdp and a relatively high nominal nominal nomination , and , as i said , because of their perseverance with regard to inflation .
in the political left , a moderate line taken by the british prime minister , mr blair , and mr blair , mr blair , who is the central leader of the fringe of the fringe of the united states leader , mr president of the united states , mr clinton , is taking a line of discrimination against the british labour philosophy of the british prime minister , mr blair .
it has not been possible for the various conservative parties to decide for a modus operandi of political rights to decide either on the example of the traditional ideology of west preparedness or , as a specific hungarian toy , with a mixture of nationalist fanaticism and populism .
it is not the case that the end of the european monetary union would be on the agenda , it is simply that people have begun to present themselves , if not likely , future scenarios in which the end of emu may be placed on the agenda .
today , across europe , we have seen how , on the basis of the common trauma and condolences to spain , we have seen an unprecedented level of solidarity ; we have to build on this enormous potential to create a logic of solidarity in our world .

it is a matter of supporting the &apos; european project &apos; when it comes to linking germany so closely to france that no one ever considers it worth wasting a war on which language is spoken in elastic thumb .
in the end , john paul ii will not be able to preach a shuffle and often find it contradictory : the rejection of the compromise with the ecumenical , rigorous , intellectual openness with the insistence on theological orthodoxy .
there is a need for sugar brot in this area , because it is of great social benefit to cover the fact that , for example , interminable flowers or footwear or computer software can be produced at low cost , since such recognition can also lead to the investment of other entrepreneurs .
in the same way , the payments in the death of one soldiers amount to only 500,000 dollars , a sum which is also well below the usual estimates ( between 6.1 and 6.5 million dollars ) for the long-term economic cost of a death if the so-called value of a statistical life is a result .
in recent years , the others have , in many cases unilaterally , expressed their interest in the early introduction of euro , even before the actual accession , and this position is strongly expressed by the polish national bank , but also by the hungarian and czech national bank .
they have reduced the debt burden of future generation to investors , who have not reduced the first signs of an increase in prices from the bond market , or who are buying property , when inflation has reduced the real value of their mortgage debt .
if kosovo is independent , and believes that it could force the contact group to postpone the proposal to the security council if it is held back in this year , then it would be an attempt to postpone the proposal to the security council when it is held in this year &apos;s elections .
in addition , the immediate , annual hospital costs resulting from medical effects have not been taken into account by dollar earnings in billions of euros , with the suffering caused by sickness , which does not lead to hospital residence ( or death ) .
for a long time , the rich have fought against taxes which would have been necessary for increased investment in education and health care for the poor , which would further increase the social clout and provide many people with no health care and training , as they would need international competition .
since 1991 , india has paved the way for the devaluation of the unscrupulous path and towards the full exchange rate release , with the indian federal reserve ( rbi ) bank already relaxed a series of trade restrictions on currency exchange .
in addition to the lack of adequate civil and security senate , which each ethnic group would have given the feeling of security , the total lack of legal mechanisms has led to an additional tension in order to ensure that the crimes committed during and after the intervention are brought to justice .
at the global war on terrorism , america is on the verge of partnerships : governments of other countries are cooperating with information and enforcement ; trade partners guarantee the safety of containers , private credit institutions , disbursing medications with which terrorist networks will be used .
however , europe should also think about its own practices , also through its trade policy , in which the eu systematically operates , to redistribute the global trade agreements for the benefit of the developing countries , and despite the promises that these unfair practices should be rectified in the current round of trade talks .

in this way , the budget deficits in the accession countries have increased enormously in the candidate countries , without the delegations , in hungary , to over 9 % of gdp in 2002 and to more than 5 % in poland , the czech republic and slovakia , while huge capital rivers have placed their currencies under strong pressure .

both politicians will be a two-way politician , but the glaring party will be in the hands of the stones who will be in the dark , at the heart of the fmd , loyalty loyalty loyalty to the gates , who will be forced to make a joke of the joke of the joke .
however , it is not the founder of a chancellor who is not the go-ahead of his wife at the very heart of the party that he has shown to be part of the constitution that he has been held , that there is a lack of power , but that it is based on the rhint of the rhine , which he , within his own party , is fighting for within his own party .

the two top candidates for his aftermath , dominique de villepin and nikola sarkozy , both in the government , are acting against each other with a reform agenda , but the years before the election have not been waited for action .
for example , the bush government has done everything it can to dismiss the high number of soldiers who have been seriously wounded , and up to now the 16,000 people who have suffered around 20 % of serious hirks or copper injuries .
you are afraid that the central banks continue to insist on monetary shortages , even after the implementation of structural reforms , to make unemployment support less attractive and to increase the ability of workers and businesses to move towards work or labour .
did mr sharon really convince himself of the demography that the &apos; big israel &apos; , which once seemed to be its dream , would actually mean the end of the jewish state , or did his return strategy of gaza mean first &apos; gaza alone &apos; ?
the situation in mexico , thailand , korea , brazil and other countries reminded us of the panic in the united states in the year 1873 or the crisis of austrian central banks in 1931 .
in reality , there are no measures for a more relaxed monetary policy - especially since the young european central bank wants to show its credibility in terms of combating inflation - and the steps to implement structural reforms are half-hearted , hesitant and small .
nevertheless , it is time to recognise that our governments are insufficient to understand the difficult technological challenges and opportunities facing the world today - and that new methods are needed to resolve a wide range of increasingly pressing global problems .
it is important to bear in mind the intellectual scrapping of the liberal idea of security - or , in fact , to understand - that this safety of international institutions is guaranteed by international law .
on the other hand , it is true that , even today , the general ban on imports carried out by the developing countries was originally introduced by the developing countries with good or bad reason : the protectionist shooting of markets in the industrialised countries during the major depression had disastrous consequences for the economies of developing countries .
at the end of 2001 , argentina &apos;s crisis at the end of the year of the year of the barbarity crisis in 1890 - with the difference that politicians and international bankers were able to wait 1890 with better ideas on compensation than they were today .

while the americans claim that nmd is opposed to no one and anything that the united states wanted , whether it be the protection of its citizens against states such as iraq or north korea , almost everyone else thinks that the russians fear that america wants its military suitability ( russia and russia &apos;s subsistence ) ; the chinese are concerned that nmd is showing a willingness to send a signal to taiwan in respect of independence , and that europeans are concerned that the american tensions could lead to russia and the united states of europe .
in the face of the serious problems of germany - a uniquely uniqueness of the release of the vlorry people &apos;s party , a glaring labour market and a vague and confusing tax system - even though it appears to be far too timid in the face of the serious problems of germany - many of the preparedness of the hostages of the coffers , in particular the foot of the goats , especially the glimpse of the fmd , are regarded as a bad trace in the street , as a sign of a bad trail , a little less than a bad family-asy tax system .
the advantages of such accession often remain unmentioned : the unique geopolitical situation of the country at the crossroads between the balkans , the south caucasus , central asia and the middle east - regions of crucial importance for european security , turkey &apos;s role as an important transit country for energy , the military capabilities of the country at a time when the eu &apos;s new defence policy is developing its new european union and the great economic potential of turkey with its young labour force .
although the protection of missiles , of clinton ( hesitant ) and of george bush ( enthusiastic ) ) - with massive support from the american congress - is different from the protection of missiles against missiles , from clinton , from clinton , to the national missile shield ( pdb ) , which is intended to provide only a modest number of celebrations , and to offer no comprehensive anti-missile protection against anti-missile missile missiles .
in the middle of 2004 , a recent election in the autumn of 2006 will be used more clearly to boost the economic recovery - and there will be a shortage of people who are expected to be on the agenda for 2010 as a &quot; economic , social and social reforms &quot; agenda 2010 &quot; , which will be a founder of the trademark of the trademarks of the trademarks of the trademarks of its national chancellor , mr president .
even though the social democrats have never known the shadows of the cease-fire ( and it certainly did not send it to the unforgotten willy bronly bronly ) , they have followed it , or they have , as long as they followed it after 16 years of frustrating in the opposition of the chancellor , mr kohlliant , who was the only guarantor of the success of the ballot box in the ballot box , who was the only guarantor of the electoral success of the ballot box .
many details have been taken into account : thailand has fled ambassadors to the interested parties , so that they have been able to provide help to their compatriots ; people who have lost their money and their passport in their homes ; the last suppliers have been created to identify easy and find solutions to find solutions that deal with problems related to the lack of light and cows .
secondly , over several years britain has seen significant economic growth as most of the other member states , so that , even in comparison with france and germany , it is one of the richer countries of the eu , and thirdly , the new member states are so much poorer than the poorest members that the new immoral right to a generous share of the budget , regardless of the size of this budget .
it is clear that carbon dioxide has come into the atmosphere in the light of the fact that carbon dioxide has come into the atmosphere , if people are burning carbon dioxide , and that co2 emissions , such as a huge product , such as a result of the decline in oilseed , and the downgrading of the forthcoming ban on oils and the heat of the earth .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , mr president of the commission , ladies and gentlemen , ladies and gentlemen , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to say that i would like to say that i am in favour of the rapporteur &apos;s desire to be once again elected to the prime minister , because he was able to argue that his domestic political rivalry was prepared to put pressure on the eu and force slovakia to compensate the people of 1945 who were displaced by the displaced by hungary .
however , what we want is structured cooperation - which means that some european states can push ahead with the development of european defence capacities - because we are not prepared to force us through the more cautious and hesitant tragedy of the 1990s in the balkans : europeans were unable to act at the time , and they were unable to act , and the americans did not do so for a time ( the americans ) .
a rare fdeman who ever visited his lawyer without having visited a university could convince his voters that a new era in the korean politics , which also takes into account the growing prosperity of south korea and the balance of the middle korean economy , will be eliminated and will be eliminated .
it seemed to be reassuring when the party of vi-urban was held in the recent parliamentary elections , but other politicians were all too tempted to catch up with unnationalistic governors - lad klaus in prague , and istober in germany , vladimir faciar in slovakia - and i still see in slovakia - and nationalism , plus the ballot box of the ballot box , in spite of the ballot box .

would one of the experts who would be presenting them : one of the experts who would consider one of the arguments in conflict and the conclusion that the most likely thing was that things would go further , or one of the experts who would be looking at their matches with their maturity with warnings , who will get out of the radicals and who will ensure that the amount of oil shooted into the oil shocks will end ?
on the other hand , i would like to say that , in the same period , you have made an exaggerated reference to the negative changes in the same direction , which have resulted in the most exaggerated positive effects of the future , as well as in other areas ( i am still waiting immediately for the forthcoming case of canada , nigeria , india , indonesia , indonesia , south africa , south africa and the south african , south africa ) .
the make-up , bragg levels , individual nuclear facilities , which are at the end of the case , will be ravaged in certain coffers , whose size has been determined by the nuclear power station - the purpose of calculating the exploration of the earth &apos;s order - and the make-up of a nuclear power station in a nuclear power station .
in the united states , the bush administration is sceptical about the strength of monetary policy , with greater budget deficits being reduced , and we hope that the risks of continuing deficits - investment , slow growth , the loss of confidence , the loss of exchange of exchange rate and exchange rate value - will be reduced , at least in any case , or at least not before the president of the council of president bush , before the end of the term of office .

the international trade relationship between developing countries has deteriorated : the prices of primary goods have decreased in relation to industrial goods , such as the prices of tropical agricultural products , contrary to the moderate climate zone , and the prices of general industrial prices in products that have been protected by copyright and intellectual property rights , are protected by intellectual property rights .
at a time when he has come to the end of the day - but with an animal from the zoo - to visit or play a golden game , a game which is one of the many &apos; civil liberalisation &apos; , which has so far been able to penetrate its by means of its reform , which has been able to penetrate by the hero of china .

as a result of my concern that the bush administration could give the world public the cost of the war in iraq the same light as iraq &apos;s weapons of mass destruction and its links with al-qa &apos;ida , i am in a position to go together with the academics of the university of harvard , so that the cost of the war can be borne by the war .
if no definitive progress is made on kosovo &apos;s final status , the situation will deteriorate in the balkans , thereby blocking serbia &apos;s rapprochement and its subsequent membership of the eu , which is undermining ethnic minorities in kosovo in a dangerous situation , in a weak situation , and in bosnia and herzegovina , as well as in the countries of bosnia and herzegovina .
mr sharon , in his country , has developed into a country that is developing people with almost some fear , and large parts of the western public believe that his policy is potentially fatal for any political hope in the region - even if it goes on in large parts of the arab world - if it remains silent and hate in large parts of the arab world .
it is only a few years ago that the people of the region and the world of a fascinating world , all the more so as its final intentions will remain the subject of unfinished discussions tomorrow - at the heart of it , and today , among those politicians who are politicians who are looking for the successors .

mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mr chávez &apos;s discredited predecessors have been forced into the hands of his mismanagement ; in the congress , a negative head of government for hostages was appointed in peru , a president of a cradle of the discredited chávez , who was forced into exile after months of exile and forced into exile .
however , during iraq , there is an increasing degree of chaos , diplomats and political leaders need to ask themselves whether it is justified for the international community to intervene as a whole , if a country does not appear to be ready or willing to act in the face of genocide , to protect its citizens against genocide and ethnic genocide .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , many votes in favour are too often in line with the iacs before they go into more complicated matters : &apos; yes , my fellow member is right : the saudi monarchy is vulnerable , but they are rare and the government has the means and the means to resist it &apos; .

on the other hand , there is no doubt that , in the light of the fact that , in 1985 and 2005 , we have seen the excessive annual forecasts for the future of 10-year forecasts , which will give rise to the great opportunities for positive changes both to the financial markets ( for example , a pro-active financial markets with 36000 points of the world &apos;s policy ( such as those in the middle east and dynamic growth in africa ) , such as those in the middle east and dynamic growth in africa , for example , in the middle east and dynamic growth in africa .
