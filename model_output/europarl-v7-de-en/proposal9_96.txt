many details have been taken into account : thailand &apos;s ambassador to the people affected , so that they have been able to help their compatriots ; people who lost their money and their passport in their homes have lost their homes ; the systems that have been rendered to be easy to identify and seeking solutions to overcome the problems associated with the lack of assistance and the deaths of the dead .
