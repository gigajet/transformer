thank you .
thank you .

is that ?
well , yeah .

that &apos;s all about .
thank you .
thank you .

pretty simple .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
whoa !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
seattle ...
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s the singing .
but it &apos;s all about .
it &apos;s not happening .
yes , hello .
we love innovation .
solar technology is ...
this is not ...
we were poor .
are they all ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
after a week .
great trick ?
we were .
a few less .
and he says ...
we know that .
ta-day !
wait twice .
here it is .
this is going fast .
they need time .
music as language .
that &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... not yet .
thank you .
what a fish .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
that &apos;s efficient .
wonderful , wonderful ?
completely inefficient .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much .
hold your head .
the only chance .
not a hospital .
thank you very much .
stephen watts .
three out of 10 .
that was incredible .
thank you . thank you .
yeah , kind of like .
it &apos;s terrible .
long , yes .
fantastic , right ?
the sun goes on .
oh my god .
we love entertainment .
we get off .
where do you go home ?
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we lose them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
a whole lot .
does that sound good ?
the whole environmental debate .
sounds familiar , what ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
that &apos;s great .
that was fascinating .
can i be honest ?
the farm is incredible .
what did you do ?
robert gupta .
this is the system .
this is all about .
yeah , good day .
lento , slowly .
all i &apos;m interested in .
we can do that .
what do you say then ?
not very sustainable .
yes , milliseconds .
that &apos;s our present .
they have similar principles .
yeah , good day .
good job ! yes !
just do your job .
this was the result .
thank you very much .
and she did .
so they meet al .
it &apos;s essential .
they &apos;re all important .
very different term .
it &apos;s incredibly exciting .
that &apos;s me even .
it &apos;s realm .
yes , that goes .
flying cat .
this is the last one .
can we change it ?
these days are over .
these people make money .
what happened here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
guess what ?
and that &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know .
centers have been built .
what happened here ?
but you know what ?
what was the result ?
i was amazed .
it &apos;s generic .
so they knew everything .
you could see manhattan .
here &apos;s the video .
it has sensors .
why not live longer ?
he opens the door .
a few more .
that &apos;s very good .
oh , so the one .
there &apos;s no normal .
yeah , i know .
pretty good , not ?
but you know what ?
i have a question .
okay . thank you .
i stood up with him .
players don &apos;t sit around .
so they can do that .
they &apos;re bad . &quot;
so let &apos;s see .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
what do these people need ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i thought about it .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
they use their hands .
so how does this work ?
how they are .
that would have been okay .
what are media today ?
you can go in .
so where do we go ?
so it &apos;s true .
how do we know ?
because you know what ?
it &apos;s not a country .
why do we do that ?
not very often .
bg : thank you .
this is a wish .
and i was artists .
let &apos;s call him .
not school management .
and the one has to go back .
we can do it differently .
they even do weh .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
an incredible challenge .
there &apos;s no food .
it &apos;s against justice .
but the wrong things are happening .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
i &apos;m a writer .
here &apos;s another example .
i assure kids .
it feels great .
i swear it .
i wonder .
it &apos;s not going to do that .
thank you for listening .
why should we do that ?
thank you .
here &apos;s an example .
you see it immediately .
not toxic inside .
but i kept working on .
or before bombs .
i &apos;ll go in here .
there are two options .
we need energy miracles .
why does this happen at all ?
oh . wait a minute .
let me tell you .
what do you want to do ?
this is what happens to us today .
and i was working on .
so she was back .
and so it was .
yes , here it is .
i agree with you all .
and why is that ?
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what would everything be done ?
i mean the soul .
you compare the same thing .
in china , it was different .
luckily , yes ?
but that &apos;s not a protection .
you have pee opportunity .
does anybody see something specific ?
and i &apos;ve always had .
very expensive mobility .
people were playing crazy .
what creates the illusion ?
my gut feeling again .
just after a journey there .
first of all , just limited .
i created one .
yeah . well . well .
imagine the camera .
jk : both .
but it gets worse .
here you see it now .
thank you very much .
be a mentor .
maybe 10 times a lot .
but it wasn &apos;t .
the data came in .
this is a great question .
i will never forget it .
it has billions of them .
have you seen these guys ?
but there &apos;s something else .
here &apos;s another example .
is it even photographery ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
ohhhh .
and then it became international .
there were remixes .
let me summarize .
okay , a couple more .
the answer is no .
it &apos;s just a lot more fun .
my name is amit .
he had the experience .
it keeps you frozen .
this is a great question .
is that your opinion ?
a nearly identical structure .
and it was even better .
that &apos;s what she did .
it has very loved it .
here you see the city .
good afternoon , all together .
will i like the color ?
ooh , thank you .
some have come and gone .
i think rather than that .
dk : 60,000 .
there &apos;s an old study .
don &apos;t be terrified .
the game is from 2007 .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
he &apos;s called paul open .
what do you think was happening ?
who will make it safer ?
first , we have the population .
i don &apos;t like that question .
but what do your fish eat ?
let &apos;s also call him don &apos;t .
this is precise .
the work of the interpreted .
but where are we useful ?
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
how do we actually work ?
... his own story .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
so , what does that mean ?
now , what does that mean ?
privacy must be given .
there are online criminals .
we have three main groups .
it was still fish .
he always showed up here .
and then it happened again .
i felt really good .
and a lot of people forget this .
crisis . death . death .
it would be untired .
it &apos;s not our fight .
it &apos;s not our problem .
we lost the contact .
why not think about that ?
we love technology and creativity .
it would be knowledge .
we constantly reject each other .
and this opens up a map .
but what do we do with it ?
that &apos;s kind of like this .
what do i look at ?
his name is tempt .
is it going to have my size ?
that sounds crazy , right ?
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
we need to spread the message .
this is what most of us know .
you also have to understand that .
this is what you see down there .
i want to ask you something .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was destroyed on the floor .
they look like this .
is it about light ?
i grew up in india .
this is the shortcut .
you see the water coming .
i had a good life .
so what did years after that ?
who are these conversations ?
i wanted to keep us healthy .
these changes come in .
how about fitness ?
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
but the crucial thing is , ...
he &apos;s working on the following .
and then they put it up .
what actually happened ?
the orange gene .
they really loved it .
but i felt bad .
the two called me up .
woman : legendary technology .
very scary .
what &apos;s the soul ?
we &apos;re not producing anymore .
i can claim everything .
he went up and down .
what else can we do ?
this is what the chart looked like .
now , i &apos;ll come to the end .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
it may sound silly .
we were twenty people .
so we &apos;re too many .
you can &apos;t have a bones .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
or is it possible ?
for conflicts of creativity .
so what do we need to do ?
they didn &apos;t have books .
this is felix .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
thank you for your attention .
this was the beginning of the journey .
i &apos;m awe for awe .
and then everybody went down .
they saw the great suggestion .
first extension , second .
well , i was the next one .
you know , who &apos;s normal ?
and ultimately , epic meaning .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
the same thing , only bigger .
who &apos;s the most successful ?
you want to feed the world ?
i wanted to support them .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
i just loved two .
one place is south korea .
again , you have it again .
this is a kind of natural thing .
my wife told me that .
and how did that feel ?
that &apos;s what you can train .
do you make that curious ?
so it &apos;s circle .
so , why are hacking ?
this happened to christmas .
what is this thing ?
it &apos;s about , you know .
they could have done better .
the answer is yes .
i don &apos;t have to worry about it .
and that &apos;s not anything yet .
is that rational ?
so that &apos;s the good news .
it was a huge success .
so they saw something magical .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
but no problem can be .
they &apos;re always saying , why ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
it wasn &apos;t just invented .
well , it should work even more .
does anybody know what that is ?
for example , this perception of context .
this is a game outside .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
but it was very sad .
so let me remind you .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
and it &apos;s the crux .
sometimes i push too much .
but they &apos;re doing the job .
they align these two people .
her mother moved to her alone .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
think about your own decisions .
this picture is from this place .
i see this little sign .
and it took 18 months .
tell me about this world .
this is very risky .
and that worked very well .
and the chase showed him four .
i learned everything .
and there are hundreds of them .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there &apos;s good news .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
i was really sad .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
but it &apos;s not that fast .
how can we help you ? &quot;
sometimes the illusion is the illusion .
no , never had been a chance .
the story is not over .
what happened this day ?
well , then we want .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
so they feel good . &quot;
they come from artists .
i should not say that .
the power can explode .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
she did it for three years .
you can have these cloud .
the data has not been available before .
game is not silly .
now , how could this happen ?
is that all that education ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
so that &apos;s what we can do .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
they don &apos;t changed the story .
everyone talks about happiness today .
tastes don &apos;t taste very well .
play doesn &apos;t mean just child games .
and that was 19 years ago .
what would you like most ?
they create an epic story .
they have so much uncertainty .
the data is constantly infecting .
nobody has ever said that before .
so paul is a terrorist .
and he actually says that .
don &apos;t take anything for you .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what should our toolbox look like ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
i almost never do it .
she was back and forth .
and of course , it &apos;s incredible .
and again , the representation .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
an autistic student .
when it &apos;s garbage right now .
so not like detox .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
we depend on two countries .
everybody needs a goldfish glass .
let them be me . &quot;
people were still happy .
it was my first sunlight .
in fact , he collected fish .
my name is brian goldman .
they share their experiences with others .
the white lines are for population .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
he showed up the algae .
this is simply not technological .
there are four and a half thousand people living there .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
and we &apos;re very happy about that .
every waste is nutritional .
and we &apos;re too many .
so the question is : how ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and it was an incredible experience .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
but there are two problems .
i started feeling better .
but , you know what ?
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
that was a great diluo .
i talk a lot about these questions .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
that &apos;s it , really simple .
we &apos;re in an area .
and that &apos;s what we did .
basically they do the same thing .
now this is one of the images .
what are the other brands doing like this ?
and then something weird happened .
you can play with different ways .
the whole building was water .
italy wins . yeah .
on the morning before the game .
that would not have been a problem at all .
creativity had to wait out .
nowadays it &apos;s all too easy .
the nurse asked the nurse .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
maybe even in our cell phones .
and it starts with a doctor .
i &apos;m going to tell you something .
we use the energy of the sun .
this is all the metadata .
because i can claim everything .
it &apos;s always going to be similar to you .
and slowly , it lasted .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
what are you trying to achieve ? &quot;
as that &apos;s not what we &apos;re going on .
what lessons have we learned ?
and the form plays a role .
you can &apos;t store energy .
then i can transmit that .
okay , that &apos;s really what makes courage .
once we started a vivid .
my second mistake was worse .
and they beat a 257 .
we all love baseball , right ?
somehow , kids don &apos;t do it anymore .
that &apos;s about five meters long .
they become free in the computer .
because anybody here has masks ?
and then it &apos;s too realizing .
among other things , things should not suffer .
this has the largest impact .
the movement of the reasons to write it .
anyway , not to navigate .
and that &apos;s very beginning .
the truth is more like this .
do you want jeans with holes ?
you can &apos;t do anything like this .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
their family gathered .
thank you very much for your patience .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
what else is risky ?
just be , who you are .
i remember my first fire .
what about a story ?
dark in . dark .
i was trying to do something exciting .
but really and effective , yes ?
but we need the impact .
zeroes , yes ?
this is completely belonging .
let &apos;s get the quiet down .
hmmm , my brand ?
that &apos;s frightening .
that sounds scary .
next : nuclear power .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
i really wanted to be normal at the time .
this is what i &apos;m going to show you .
as soon as the judge looked at me .
we can &apos;t just do that .
so i went to court .
i got a bit scared of technology .
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
and there are several reasons for this .
they sell certificate .
it &apos;s not going to document .
why am i going to the medicine ?
it can know where we are .
it spreads rapidly .
all adults were aware of the risks .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i like things that are different .
i went to jail -- hard .
it didn &apos;t make any sense .
this is a child game , right ?
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
and this video is in real time .
the game starts -- swiss .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
what about longevity ?
they &apos;re just better than reality .
so the correlation is low .
so , look what happens .
it &apos;s really changed the dynamics .
so i just started to play .
and then we said , okay .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
i &apos;ll shoot something through the head .
have you ever been disguised ?
this is like learning from weekends .
because for me , it means memory .
how and what does he feel ?
we say in germany .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
music is medicine . music changes us .
it turns out to be really hard .
and you know what i learned ?
these will be inevitable .
but what will happen in the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and this is a very simple question .
that has nothing to do with science .
and this can make a big difference .
but there &apos;s another reason .
anyway , we need a solution .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
i &apos;m listening to it , thank you very much .
they fought the canals .
in the assumption , maybe two percent .
we started it 15 years ago .
how far do you get there ?
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
do you know what neither is ?
so the first step to an interpretation .
and it &apos;s still not an interpretation .
that has to be the difference .
when you get to that , yes ?
you can show me , i was there .
this is just the minimum .
we can win our nutrients .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
on the book and on the picture .
this image reminded me of something .
i find them off .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but perhaps this is not the case .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
i want to prove that to you .
it was a pretty bad project .
here he leaves the sun .
this is the storage .
these rivers are taking very rapidly .
a has these benefits and risks .
our magazines are read by millions .
lego made it possible for everyone .
privacy is not the debate .
they were genetically inherited .
i &apos;m definitely the new doctor .
i don &apos;t take the same amount .
baseball is full of great statistics .
because we live on a planet .
do we really want to go to this direction ?
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
and these are the neural structures .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
oh , my time is over ?
something went into me .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
so we measured his movement .
this is a picture of the object .
it was quite popular .
you see something fun here .
i really like beautiful clothing .
he can only use his eyes .
but the truth is far away .
you can do that all the time .
so this crazy story could be true .
who would ever be a wish ?
the defeat would have been too easy .
her father died shortly after her birth .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have cents .
we need to increase complexity slowly .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
here &apos;s her march .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
but then you really want to get deep down .
you want to orient in the museum ?
that was more concrete .
okay , you really want to know ?
and i had to go out of the city .
we won some prices .
who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
it &apos;s enlightenment with kids .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
no , i mean really serious .
i hold the knife in my hand .
and the goal is very simple .
i shoot my sleeve back .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
now i see greg moon .
a billion people will be hungry today .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
i loved from this fish .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and this sounds very different than before .
he &apos;s been on sixth .
i started a institute .
they even get funding with funding .
the film hasn &apos;t been spent yet .
we need to think about what brands are .
what do you do with it ? &quot;
i call this the bright thing .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 .
it &apos;s not necessarily bad .
this is ideology , not science .
and it took me so through me .
today , 6.8 billion people are living .
just like this , it &apos;s going to come .
it &apos;s busy with snails .
the hot projections today .
automatically , he goes to the right idea .
that &apos;s how the natural things are done .
but it requires a lot of planning .
we can invent everything again .
as we think from north .
and it depends on phosphorus .
often in the third one , forget .
longer than these two networks are .
the rocks are colored .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
it &apos;s about changing change .
i started with my usual talk .
this is a very sensitive question .
i learned that from my grandmother .
now we do this with airplanes .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
and every morning i jump on that .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
the peaks are very good .
what are they going to describe ?
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
there are also worlds .
to ask , what is the right thing ?
when people are talking about the urine .
i don &apos;t know who knows what .
the living rooms .
they gave their blood pressure .
thank you , but the best part comes .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
happy productivity . fantastic !
the result of that was catastrophic .
and everyone in this room has to be in .
here &apos;s the olive oil .
bjvillan sundin .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
risk is not a simple game .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
we &apos;ve been running a lot of procedures .
this may be transmitted .
my brother was staring at me .
these are the app saras .
i talked a lot about magic .
who could have looked at everything ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who do you really want to inform ?
completely , a certain goal .
what do you think happens next ?
they have them . they always have them .
so this is a tough one .
it &apos;s now constant .
they literally set up the lever .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
i hope you forgive me .
most of all , when he died .
so there are two circles .
the side product is clean water .
that sounds very unusual for the first time .
we built unique elements here .
you always decrease rare animals .
she &apos;s going to touch her deeper .
he died , broken through the story .
here &apos;s how the building works .
they drilled each other .
tell them what they feel .
the other one had died .
let &apos;s do a little interactions .
here you have this little mechanism .
there it &apos;s been tuned .
the interest is interested in fireflies .
the question is , what &apos;s coming now ?
students are divided to notes .
these things are logical correctly .
and here you feel it already .
and for energy , i noticed this .
i tried to understand them .
all of these generations need just a few milliseconds .
and nobody seems to get up .
i had written these crazy things .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
and curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
this is also a paradigm shift .
a daltiner , right .
you can see from the back to the front .
so from modern society in modern society .
and that &apos;s what they do .
we need to get far and quickly .
it &apos;s a new supply of america .
they &apos;re all embarrassed questions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they &apos;re the hot countries of somebody .
we are running through initiational rituals .
now look at this curve .
widesperately belong to our lives .
i &apos;m treating people in death .
they were inspired to be inspired by us .
leadership might have some mutations .
so scott gets this fruit .
we worked until late the night .
so i made my gut feeling .
he moved back into the silence .
now we saw the reverse effect .
have all applauded audiences .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
so , not so optimistic .
he switches off the cracks .
let &apos;s start with this .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
they had a concept of blue blood .
i believed everybody could do that .
i never met him personally .
even cats look at this video .
there was jimmy kimum .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
how would you describe your brand ?
we &apos;re talking about kitchen , fresh .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
no , that was what i thought .
i &apos;m a redundancy person .
that &apos;s not the route .
this is a painting of a circle .
the roof was covered with water .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
and women argued the successfully .
we can support them , be good .
look at what it does .
the main man winds me .
sexual reproduction goes into the image .
i &apos;m going to read you the entry .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
that &apos;s the truth . i think that &apos;s what i believe .
we &apos;re talking about twenty of it .
it was really immensely profound .
he shook his head , no .
this is going to happen next april .
we also have very detailed data .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
the mechanism is from the lie .
but with the right design , please .
we can support them , be good .
just saying , what &apos;s information ?
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
there was never time before like this .
and even lomborg thinks about it .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
and also , these sources are undermined .
how will you feed the world ? &quot;
this is an ecological network .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot;
the chef had cook him .
you &apos;re doing this kind of box .
this is such a trajectory .
the thing that had just been represented .
what is a fifth milliseconds ?
i see the daltiner .
it might take up until it is .
maybe you need to have a look behind it .
no , no , no , missed .
and this picture was taken by atatlas .
156 nations are sending our national television channel .
they created their internet connection .
but today we are far beyond that .
she wasn &apos;t drunk yet .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
that &apos;s the system we live in .
but i kept asking myself to these questions .
and that was what i felt .
we expect an extraordinary couple of decades .
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
you also want to wipe your wish .
something very strange happened here .
and that was the outbreak of that .
i learned a couple of simple things .
it can know how we keep it .
so it creates a feedback loop .
boston is not just a call center .
this is a modest little app .
this is from another place .
&quot; you haven &apos;t let you go . &quot;
i lived in parallel space .
somebody did an old-fashioned version of it .
and i &apos;d like to read them .
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
you can be logical and intuitive .
tell me a little bit about this part .
do it possible -- all of you here .
tempt is fully paralyzed .
does anybody even know what that is ?
so this is the reason for this project .
it &apos;s &quot; i jump with me . &quot;
let me tell you a little bit about that .
there &apos;s no way of these things that we don &apos;t exist .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
we can give ourselves something like this .
so the first exciting primat .
and there &apos;s hence in a way .
daniel hneman : sure .
everyone would like to make people happier .
the domain also plays a role .
and why ? intelligent food changed .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
we have masses now in this country .
not the truth will be free .
because now you can apply a sentence .
you see the timeline at the top .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
thank you , danny kahman .
we get an absolutely flat line .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
because we don &apos;t want genes around ?
we don &apos;t want seed companies .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
they lead the process , they understand it .
there are some things that need to come together .
and what do you do with the garbage ?
bad ? i was completely confused .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and then he can walk away .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
his personal versions of the seas .
i &apos;m trying to do this in an example .
it has to be devastating as a present .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
this is a annual water river .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
it &apos;s a little virus killing bacteria .
now this level of intuition is very important .
so little-open source is open source .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
grow five centimeters .
maybe i did it with good reason .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
let &apos;s get something else out there .
it comes out of our own bags .
normal people are not accessible . &quot;
as an artist , it &apos;s very important to me .
this is roberto dance .
and no matter , italy won the end .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
but the game is a formal transformation .
thank you . i have a question for you .
he had 20 minutes of music .
now , i &apos;m going to show you .
this is just a conversion .
it should reveal the two elements .
shake the environment , make less waste .
but i &apos;m going to talk about that in a minute .
yes . she doesn &apos;t do anything other than discover .
the goal of the film is transparency .
one language is expression of the human mind .
it was a zaceh .
what they need is a new medical culture .
alone , shame and without support .
do you want to get there and listen ? &quot;
i think our identity is threatened .
many of my clients are very young .
my cousins all over the place .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
here are two different jews .
now , who is ready for this journey .
i &apos;ve got it here on my laptop . &quot;
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist .
a whole snake of cool food .
the difference is perceived as loss .
in two hours , they &apos;re building everywhere .
the emergency room had all the strands .
no insurance can make itself quantum .
there are lots of great books in this topic .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputer .
this country is different from 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
you can predict the future . why is that ?
what kind of apple do i do ?
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
don &apos;t half the one or a quarter ? &quot;
so what can we do from all this ?
so basically a translation of translation .
no tree is carbon neutral .
and on , now you see him always .
the next step is now happening within this communities .
he had uploaded a lot of natural videos .
this is just the labor worker .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
thank you very much . that was incredible .
so , he &apos;s sitting there . right .
this really solves the fuel problem .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
this is a piece of you .
it just wasn &apos;t before , you know ?
in other areas -- the world of communication .
this is my supermarket . no big .
but western governments also help themselves .
sleeping lack is ubiquitous .
i &apos;m going to be tired of how we all do .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
if you burn coal , no .
you say there &apos;s no prediction .
can you play me in blue ?
no , we emphasize what &apos;s inside .
and there &apos;s a central point .
right ? everybody &apos;s eaten .
so it &apos;s more like the norm .
now , what are archaean models ?
and the list is going on .
so , that was my primary motivation .
they &apos;re new america . they &apos;re finding more .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we asked around , and nobody knew it .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
monday : color is something full .
it has a sense of serenity .
and then it looks like this .
do you remember the winch again ?
so , help me a little bit .
imagine mozart &apos;s kind of efficient .
i &apos;m excited that i &apos;m there .
the water quantities have a bigger scale .
you care about the bad thing .
man 3 : i &apos;m the guy &apos;s museum .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a lippie pen .
in between , the instruments have evolved .
i want to quickly explain this a little bit .
in fact , it didn &apos;t want to make a viral video .
in this three-sentence , three sentences come in .
three phrases are still from school .
you can zoom in and zoom out .
now i add a bass .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
if not , squeeze somebody else .
this is the machine below genesis .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
they laughed more than they &apos;re doing .
your problem is that you have too little .
third , escalation of expectations .
the official dogma of what ?
you just stop talking , and then you start talking .
let me show you how they work .
it &apos;s a game called following .
i call them &quot; the income billion . &quot;
we think of energy tonight .
it &apos;s about . thank you .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
you &apos;re walking around and you &apos;re flourishing .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
imagine an airplane too .
that means something that &apos;s built in the city .
second half-time . end of the normal game time .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
imagine that for just one moment .
raise your hands . let me see you .
maybe we can see persistence as change .
dumb is not much better .
people suffered . people fired .
and let them start with an example .
you know that science is not a company .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so , this really struck me .
i tried to preserve the body .
life had not changed for centuries .
but that &apos;s how many years got to help .
my grandmother never forgot me to be alive .
my fourth technology : predicting complexity .
the third technique : categorization .
it includes a thousand square miles .
you get to two because -- very simple .
you &apos;re supposed to tell me about my brand .
it was something that we knew .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
donic &apos;s : self-confidence is the key .
they are in the back of our bodies .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
i wanted to rebuild the health of a disease .
now , if you think about a piece of things .
what ? that really left me .
we regardless of food .
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
we forced them . puff puff .
my parents are 80 on the ferences .
and there &apos;s the laughing problem .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
we &apos;re talking about drinking information .
you can jump directly to a particular copy .
you can dive in a particular year .
because that &apos;s what &apos;s evidence about it , right ?
shake the environment , consumers need less energy .
that &apos;s what &apos;s called osit-sized model .
now you &apos;re looking at the daltiner .
and the two of them are also here today .
yeah , i &apos;m scared of all these things .
that &apos;s where you have to go down , down to zero .
i didn &apos;t let myself escape .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
and over time , you can react to other people .
our goal was to just say , okay .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go back again .
everything about this is compost .
it &apos;s all in it , it &apos;s useful .
this will be done in china in a second .
the phosphorus problem is much critical .
anyway , they do that in the middle .
the permanent ice is marked with red .
and if not , dance still dance .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
my mother asked us to embrace their hand .
seriously -- the sign of the lecture .
now , this cartoon is doing some excitement .
here &apos;s a couple on the hampton .
so this is how the supermarket is .
i thought i could integrate myself .
we still think they &apos;re originally originally .
the three words said , do you remember ?
i remember it was yesterday .
here &apos;s the chance to do something .
well , i went to the courthouse .
i said , &quot; ok , oma . &quot;
we &apos;re in the middle of this whole point .
i work in the solar industry .
and let me show you a simple example .
but it has an unexpected waste .
so the point made it fit together .
but we seem to be very satisfied with it .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
scott was interrupted by man .
and here &apos;s each piece of very well planned .
after that , it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
is it about the details or the color ?
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
no one has to have ideas of green light .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
i think i may have heard more hands .
this would be somebody who is completely intuitive .
eeeternal ! no , thank you .
and this is a million-dollar concern .
so we need digital security systems .
so again , the fit really well together .
the internet and services is a miracle .
interspecies comes in many different forms .
so they get rid of them ; they save the shoes .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
we &apos;ve been here for 130,000 years .
what we want is to create the future .
i &apos;m not going to be in real life of this feedback .
there &apos;s a lot of fortune coaching .
let me show you the nearby .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
complaint . commend .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
they were just like the people in this room .
my grandparents got this number to 70 .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
we need to be used for more research .
there &apos;s every footprint on it .
i would normally take the needle now .
there &apos;s somebody sitting in the back , who had no childhood .
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
so we &apos;re going to have a machine here .
what happened to these design students ?
this becomes a key element of this tooling .
they live with help from chemosynthesis .
i was totally enthusiastic , you know .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
and every evening they &apos;re flying 240 kilometers back .
every morning they &apos;re flying 240 miles to the farm .
how is the feeding ? &quot;
natural light then offers smart tone .
nobody else did it in the world .
picasso responded , just wait .
we create new tensions and conflicts .
the ecology of ecology is a global one .
now i &apos;m going to do something even more .
they &apos;re all on their way back .
and they had to remove what we did .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we just signed up .
but here &apos;s what you should think .
they can &apos;t get them wrong .
what do you do with certificate ?
this is alfred gonzalez .
there can be a sequence of change .
and this is very important in medical research .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for this .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
then he whispered me to the ear .
the rest of time is delusions .
i start with some simple examples .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask major questions .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
the question is why people accept that .
and i got back to work .
it &apos;s connected through oxygen and silicon .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
then i asked myself , how could this happen ?
first of all , i thought that would be a game .
the storytelling needs more and more senses .
and try that whole again with another generation .
today , a lot of people have given up the government .
the next week is going to go to market .
she &apos;s got a button .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
thank you so much for the invention of behavioral economics .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demands .
the first is a classic , apple .
it &apos;s as i &apos;d like to be .
these things have a positive effect .
no one wanted to do something about the movie .
what do you think the answer will be ?
on the left , you can see a little boat .
that &apos;s why i think we need to be leaders .
so we have this awful simplistic idea .
so two pairs , each towel , every baby .
ladies and gentlemen , their relatives .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
the teachers didn &apos;t know something was changed .
it was ah beyond the imagination .
the best part is coming -- in a second .
so every concert is a different concert .
so , not saving , avoiding , avoid .
and everything is packaging or content .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
they support other people from their mistakes .
i put them and made me care of the treatment .
you know how to call you a 4,00th ?
notice two things about this curve .
and i have to say , there was my force .
my mother was the youngest of their 10 children .
at 16 , i started illustrating books .
that our contribution to the system is choosing .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
he hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
i don &apos;t want to change anything else in life .
so i spoke a couple months later at a conference .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- that &apos;s how their fingers walk along .
i want to show you a little bit here .
and of course , it did , but then it made click .
it was summer , and i had shots .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
and they &apos;re not just going to die of masses .
what happened is that we could do this .
they don &apos;t invest time in power .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
&quot; great , i said . i put it on .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
anyway . that &apos;s what i want to do for everybody .
technical circles are the same as it is .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for 9 .
i put it here in particular .
at the beginning , the tribal society gets through language .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
so , you &apos;re supposed to be able to get away from the outside .
we don &apos;t raise identity ; we invent it .
it was much los angeles , and i was in eggs .
and i &apos;m going to just summarize it for you .
now everyone &apos;s trying to figure out something out of this pattern .
he came to me and hugged me .
all of those who were like this started sharing .
but it &apos;s definitely not a optimal situation .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you do that crazy ?
the country on the land she would roll up .
so smartings , a huge topic everywhere .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
we want to do something against death penalty companies .
there &apos;s a couple of interesting developments there .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet , a realistic level of realization .
so the theme of the day : financial saving .
in fact , no , that was not the mistake .
and what i say now is very important .
and we need to improve a lot more of this device .
it happened four and a half years ago in italy .
and i &apos;m saying that that &apos;s good .
this is a problem that many players have .
i &apos;ve summarized the last three of the five .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
stores this , lions the rest .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
well , what is the brand of marry ?
i want to help you calm yourself .
both of them are survival , both healthier .
as i said , amanda contributes our elephants .
there was no canny outs .
have you taken all your vitamins today ?
so this was a highly strange experience .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
there &apos;s this wind blowing around , virtually .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
the only thing that had was your head .
so for him , they were just cloth .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
this is a dead turtle .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
i &apos;ve got something here that i want to show you .
how would it be longer to live in good health ?
we don &apos;t want companies to patent companies .
and i found this incredibly exciting .
they have the flow of water .
so we can &apos;t wear these things .
in the countries where people are getting money .
and what &apos;s it like , because actually , in there ?
we understood that the weather is global .
and in this head , the memory was remembered .
you saw it in the news .
this is a completely unsustainable pattern .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
everyone in my neighborhood is neighborhood .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
there seems to be an uninterdependence .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
we did it in the last 1,000 years .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
now they understood the advantage of prototyping .
this is the u.s. for hundreds of years .
i think the first place is the curiosity .
the flamingos eat the garden .
these were the very first calculations of six years ago .
but maybe you can also agree with them .
but today we &apos;re only talking about the biological systems .
not to be compost , of course .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficiency ?
and we see it goes through .
because we don &apos;t feel effective money .
yes , what should be biohacking ?
here &apos;s a couple of people who test it .
the fact is , coal is not dirty .
there are those that are much more spatial .
the headquarters are exactly here .
i thought he had kidney stones .
and then i &apos;m going to give back to my doctor .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
we want to reduce the number of prisoners .
the swiss is ozone .
the dutch dna was an interesting step .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
but what happened to &quot; daunting &quot; is different .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the labels .
no apple ever shocked again .
good night , sweet rat . &quot;
now he puts a tractor in the scene .
and they also feel their movements and their tendency .
if your job is dance , dance .
so we complained about 50 of the magnets .
this is footage over a six seconds .
but leaving is not always such a bad thing .
in our own countries , we would never do anything like this .
they &apos;re going to be rare because we &apos;re going to catch them .
so you don &apos;t necessarily miss the animals .
all these things are error inevitable .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
i still remember it was yesterday .
and i &apos;m going to come up with a figure in the book .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
so each one was a little bit different .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
i put my job on 95 kilograms .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
i said to my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
we found that it really moves around .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
the answer is probably going to be &quot; no . &quot;
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
this is something like our championship .
that &apos;s how they can move the whole movement .
here &apos;s the results we &apos;ve just got .
but how do you do that in practice ?
and it &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
i don &apos;t want to reach it by dying . &quot;
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
that &apos;s the problem i try to solve .
that &apos;s not how happy a person lives .
and you ask : what &apos;s going to happen to these moments ?
... that the dose has a role .
probably a lot of you here in the room know this trick .
yes , they &apos;re right . we &apos;re going to fix that .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
and why ? because paul vaccine made a vaccine .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
well , i understand that . that &apos;s what i do .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
these silly films don &apos;t bring us any money .
i can turn the sequence during them .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
for nathaniel , music means seek health .
that &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
because in fact , this person is not interested in evidence .
because we can &apos;t live without those liescalators .
he &apos;s just faking them and not himself .
why do i have to afford that little car ?
a phrase with his own breath .
the interpretation is barely spoken at the beginning of class .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
it &apos;s kind of a connectivity of a pooe .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say that .
or they didn &apos;t have any photo spectators .
and this leads us to one of the big question .
it &apos;s virtual reality , and it &apos;s not computers .
yes , what do we do now ?
and the world in which we lived like this .
and we can navigate these very simple navigation .
if you do it , this is what happens .
and that was not a hard thing to diagnose .
i was a twenty obsessive student .
all right , really good , maybe an all-star .
wealth , not debt , affects the outcome .
she had the last word in every family string .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
and we use this word with these kinds of versions .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and that worked . applaud for scott .
i made the decision to go to the united states .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
and finally , we should be transparency .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
or are you rather a downstairs ?
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
so what are we going to see in the movie ?
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve figured it out .
and this is the planning behind stuxnet .
i learned that it &apos;s all different .
each polar mountain has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature &apos;s nature .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
look , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
it &apos;s nating and it &apos;s just nating .
we have the passion of an innocent innovator .
that &apos;s moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
we want to create mass extinctions . &quot;
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
now we do this with drills and machines .
this is the call center center for service and information .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
we have all navigation systems in our cars .
but at the same time , we know it &apos;s not possible .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , let me show you a little bit more of that .
here we were , and this is the painting .
emc : &quot; give transparency to transparency . &quot;
there was a whole lot of crazy things going on .
from the avian age to machine age .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same thing in disabled movement .
but are we going to make the best out of our game ?
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
so we have 1.5 billion players at all .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
but do you know what you don &apos;t have a right ?
i thought we &apos;re going to take the pockets right now .
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
and so i came up with something unusual .
so my two passions were kind of passionate .
you do something that &apos;s actually a bit different .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
i don &apos;t know who knows this picture .
i &apos;m just going to say that &apos;s logically .
it seems to me that it seems to be very important .
the question of death penalty is an interesting question .
the child in me is really enthusiastic about this .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamics .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
the underwater part comes from a rock .
when i say reality , i mean photo-real reality .
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
and how was that for them ? what was it successful ?
a little bit more about them , they &apos;re not .
it was &quot; forever , forever . &quot;
tuesday : adaptation is completely overrated .
the dog ! i was linguistic .
do you want to be more attractive and self-conscious ?
it wasn &apos;t meattered , and it was blue .
people in the side of the rooms come in now .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and some of them didn &apos;t work and mankind .
so we walk before , and where are we going ?
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
but the phosphorus will not be replaced .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
we wanted to develop a tool for language learning .
i may have another 40 years of work in me .
do you know what the answer to this question is ?
if you want to create hyperlinks between the images .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not perceived as big loss .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
this is the kind of teachers at the bottom .
now there &apos;s a whole lot of studies now .
and we learn trust and the rules of play .
probably one of these numbers has to come close to zero .
and i said , &quot; yes , very like . &quot;
you can say things here , the world &apos;s influence .
... if you could just point the slide .
just as i think we &apos;re going to play a game today .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the need for aid .
and i went over and just stopped .
it also turns out to be in other places .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
another favorite picture of me , star holiday .
these results have been achieved by several weeks of hard work .
this player is in front of a episode .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going to come out ? &quot;
there &apos;s a program that maybe some people know about this .
i &apos;m very grateful for the size here .
you know , he was 35 here .
and yet , we still don &apos;t understand the possibilities of it .
my mother suffered from the boat .
these are the people that shape my view of the world .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the borders .
we see this in all sorts of different areas of the human life .
and just as it was after the three months .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent .
the main problem here is similar to aids .
the logic doesn &apos;t do anything about reality .
i have a nice example of this .
then i say , heart suffering , yes ?
and we find ourselves as often as we want to .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing kids to the world .
his whole labor process has changed after that .
i said , &quot; i promised , oma . &quot;
it &apos;s hidden and weird programs .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
there are some places that we can turn to .
we called it the digital water palion .
because they have special skills of processing .
so here are some natural light bulbs .
the second factor is the services that we use .
so , my way of making films completely different .
it &apos;s hard to overview the destruction .
so you could feel comfortable to sell him .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
that means the ants are much more than we do .
and we can look at that now .
go and squeeze leonard cohen .
so , pull them off and start inventing them .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
so , just imagine two other little changes .
how many would choose for a good memory ?
and this is like &quot; bible the message . &quot;
so please listen to me , if a music is played .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
the logic doesn &apos;t say anything about what it is .
the first two sentences are logical .
in fact , we know something else is the case .
now that should actually not be a joke , but .
and then they do that again and then they experience the sentence .
we can do these things in different examples .
what remains us is , it &apos;s the mother-in-law .
they moved to a natural nature concept .
so these women were getting together and they were just getting together .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and we created an ipad app .
darwinian and sponsors became healthy .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzles .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you zoomed in . you can really go in .
you can see in all these museums there .
how much money is required to save that ?
think about it . this attack is generic .
and if it doesn &apos;t , it doesn &apos;t do anything .
so we &apos;re starting with a wind-winning drones .
he says , &quot; give up to the pronounce . &quot;
imagine a soundscape plane .
it &apos;s a totally denial of errors .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .
this is another view on the tree of life .
they divided the kingdom into two .
this is one of the classical expressions of play .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
we had no child paralysis in this country .
and i took a while to figure that out .
we repeated this practice with the same students .
you have to be willing to take risks like this .
&quot; look at your walks , pink .
there &apos;s no overpopulation problem in trees .
then you &apos;ll notice that it has a change .
and the third area that explains himself really himself from themselves .
i &apos;m looking at the conversations with you !
every big picture is the beginning of a section .
you wouldn &apos;t starve out , and you know what ?
or are you more like a downstairs ?
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
this is the consequence that we need to imagine .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i said , &quot; please fly in the air . &quot;
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
play is the tickle that keeps us apart .
if you give something to you , you &apos;ll be able to do it now .
how would you want to be better than you are at the moment ?
they teach them to open doors .
antony : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
and here are two patients . these are their records .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive cognitive bite .
i think that &apos;s true for everybody on the planet .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
so , a climate change will be terrible for you .
i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times website .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
so , it &apos;s also always interesting to know as a designer .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
but the volume are much bigger than ever before .
it grows in winter and shrinking in summer .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
everybody knew your genius was a bit lap .
we repair them , repair them .
and the world in which we now look like this .
but these are all roads in the united states .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
child mortality has dropped to a tenth of 10 .
this is also where it comes back .
manias is something that &apos;s half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
and you know what my answer to all of this is ?
we walk into the arms of the placebo industry .
there are other innovative companies in the nuclear sector .
where is the biggest interest of what &apos;s really going on ?
and also , the energy source is very important for them .
we went to the wreck of titanic .
because artists have dumped local ratio .
and at all , you &apos;ve worked a lot less than i do .
or b because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
i &apos;ll never play more like this , right now .
it &apos;s the form of reform , yes ?
and less usable or usable is it .
how can i make a difference ?
i don &apos;t see why that shouldn &apos;t be .
so how do we work when we look in there ?
each society is precise by a primary medium .
and these interactive portraits are perceiving each other .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fossil generation of fourth generation .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built watermarks .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
they get a model that comes out of the whole earth .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
and she said the three words : remember you ?
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
so in other words , i want to define what i want .
and i see the same process combined by photographs .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it was looked at almost 200 million times a year .
they had 348 different kinds of marrow .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
he described one of them as very usual .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
in a place , the screen is filled with leaves .
so the pyeecology movement has done it .
and there are projects like this one on every level of government .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
we should put the bear in the cage .
are they mindful and monkeys like 2,000 ?
the living self has no voice in this choice .
they are in the united states , in europe and japan .
and in the world , everything made a sense for me .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
quotes , in a moment of the head .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
so gender can emerge in many different varieties .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s going to be a girl .
and no , it &apos;s not science or san francisco .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open towers ?
here &apos;s the recent version of this trajectory .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
and this was kind of the first of people of developed toys .
as a consequence , we build stronger social relationships .
they never get a job they can &apos;t solve .
i mean , i rarely saw flat lines .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
and the film is called &quot; the science of action . &quot;
well , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
well , we presented the mayor &apos;s mayor .
now , today we know everything about where our things come from .
frankly , a gate . italy makes a gate .
how do you enlist people because of their characteristics ?
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressive .
he drives five of hopeful hope from my consciousness .
is it true for others or is it affecting us ?
so i say , let &apos;s start the world changing games !
edward castva is a national scientist .
now we spend three billion hours a week playing online .
the biggest difference between you is the transition with time .
we tried to get to the automation point .
bg : one energy breakthrough is the most important .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t tell you yourself .
with pivot , you can dive into a decade .
but for many people , that &apos;s a little too radical .
so , i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i understood that this is exactly the nature of art .
in fact , the notes are very vague and unprecedented .
because we don &apos;t do things anymore .
there it is going to be more like my glasses .
as i said , it &apos;s only begun .
this is an interactive movies .
and wool√© ! it &apos;s for you to get to the point .
i &apos;m still going to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and everybody knew that it worked like that , right ?
i &apos;d rather do this work that i love .
and the question is , are these good news or bad news ?
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
here it says , &quot; your fingers on every light . &quot;
the next step was to find the apps for it .
we know one more , where all of us are available .
so , you just go to google &apos;s nuclear project .
what other metamtamaires do they go through ?
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money trying to see .
this constant feedback is not in real life .
i &apos;m going to explain it for you , and then explain it .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
a research mester : a research issue of design
i &apos;m also going to dissolve the same thing that &apos;s in there .
you don &apos;t know anything in this gold glass . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great things .
in the future , most crimes will play online .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
now it &apos;s on the red list of dangerous species .
30 years ago , this may have been ridiculous .
but i really believe that after we come to something .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
the cellular communities started to abstract information again .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital physician .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacine .
&quot; don &apos;t &quot; get caught as untrue .
i didn &apos;t know how to use this .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s being put together .
also , urban designers and construction are very interested .
it &apos;s not even online . it &apos;s not a stretch .
that &apos;s how it doesn &apos;t work at all for memory .
our steps at digitization of life were exponentially exponentially .
this is star ennight , probably never seen before .
in the course of that discovery journey , i learned a lot .
as a child , i used to draw comic books and so on .
when we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
this is now a wider target of our goal .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things at the same time .
we were advising around the same way as we were .
many talk about 80 percent reduction until 2050 .
i was quite obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
so when sound says , there &apos;s no soul .
this is the most difficult part in my talk .
i can &apos;t play the way in 20 years .
both of my cases were on me , framing me .
so a lot of testosterone , but not a reaction to that .
so the growth rate accelerates itself .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my axes .
1m is the highest thing i saw .
a manhattan project ? how do we get to goal ?
that &apos;s the way we think about how to think about how to think .
these are spaces that can respond to smart people .
now , how do people die in such hacks ?
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
i sell smart animals all over the country , around the world .
this is my meat , and i can turn it around .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
no , that throwaway is exactly the right thing , yes ?
many of you are covered by faces .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
in both cases , surgeries and they went well .
she had no treatment of brain damage .
the ethnicity is the great legacy of humanity .
and the fish also was lucky to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the language of language .
it was the mismatch . it was missed against drugs .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
there &apos;s more behind it , it &apos;s still deeper .
but we just know a little bit about where the things go .
ok , imagine that like extreme self-motivating .
i know what people think when you see that .
ask questions , ask your evidence , demand it .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
as it used to be , it was happening on the village .
this is what happens to be the genesis machine age .
there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
they put them on the beatty machine .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental disorder .
it could happen within a period of time learning framework .
... it gives the crowdsourcing view .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
i worked in a coal miner -- dangerous .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
and there was crunchy root and he meant like that ?
that means going back to the board .
so , like a human being is dealing with some kind of things .
and of course , as design takes influence in terms of perception .
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
it &apos;s just breathtaking .
lawyer : i &apos;m a lawyer .
we have a abstract abstract language .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
but actually , it was a little bit more fun in this night .
we had to worry about the lawyers , etc .
it was called &quot; automatically de stein . &quot;
diginar is a certified place .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
what are they going to consume ? what are they going to do ?
he took a famous photograph . how was it ?
it slows down for one of our big problems .
we see the process that feeds itself from itself .
guess what ? yes . alive ? alive .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
but combined , you can create something special like this .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
because the images eat it for them to recommend .
well , you &apos;re in the museum , you &apos;re in this museum .
the idea is to lift a digital security system .
or other models , or even technological specifications .
and this is actually a conservative estimate .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain it .
we can put this time machine into everything we want .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
in fact , the advanced society is based on energy progress .
this was not a movie , no hd , it was real .
i was not there long ago with miguel .
because , you know , this is a fun process .
have you ever seen a clipneutral tree ?
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i described .
if you want to get too far , go together . &quot;
you know , america is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
froze , the man will clean every day .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
so i take a step back and i look at the other way .
i filmed in warfare -- hard and dangerous .
so we should soon figure out what the goal is .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
if we &apos;re building cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
when the child is born , it looks like a girl .
in other words , play is our adaptation .
can you imagine something good that comes from tobacco ?
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds across their pain .
you can just call some names and people will understand .
diphy , tutorn , baby paralysis ...
this is a variation of a thing that was made .
well , the power of epiphany is about time .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
it caused immense juvenile juvenile space .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s this little bit of effort . it &apos;s taste .
the shrimp eats the physical lankton .
and that &apos;s how he &apos;s flying his elders .
and then there &apos;s a whole lot of simulations .
however , this was not as common in the aciental years .
the musical instrument is the extension of our bodies .
he lived only nectless than three years .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
a baby needs about a sixth of wind .
so i know some of the people who didn &apos;t wear .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
in 25 years , it will be gone from here to here .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to shine the sun .
please follow me , because the circle will come back .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
this is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
they get to thabo mki in south africa .
but then i thought , you know what , we &apos;re honest .
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
bruno ussaniti : thank you . thank you .
i have a friend who &apos;s going to drive a passage .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound of sound .
and because we &apos;re getting older , we &apos;re going to get the wind bigger .
this is the time where you fall in love .
and we &apos;re still very , very , very strong stories .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and the predictions that you &apos;ve read are serious .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
and i don &apos;t expect that to be going to change .
it &apos;s also my great , life-long love and fascination .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
why don &apos;t we buy them if we can &apos;t buy them ?
you have to admit that this is a great choice .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
a few years ago , i started developing littlettes .
the brochure makes you still seem untouched .
my grandfather was in the prohibition in prison .
she was a taper , strong woman , she had impact .
so , in a sense , the technology is giving us the technology .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it realistic ?
but what if you want to see the paintings ?
but my logical side has not liked it either .
i just want to say a little bit about salatdressing .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . heart wish .
we also brought littlettes to design schools .
this is the chesapeake bay .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to get against injustice .
my uncle died of alcohol diseases .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also worthwhile .
in fact , we &apos;re such a multi-cellular community .
what is this new condition that takes the world slowly ?
let &apos;s call the animal act , it costs a lot of money .
if a neighbor helps the other , we encourage our communities .
ohhhhhh , woww !
you always worry that you &apos;re losing the real estate .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and my talk today is mainly arrested by these cognitive biases .
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
open the card , and jump it with a click .
you know , we hear a whole lot about transparency .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
you could also use ordinary design -- technology to spread .
one of my friends did it -- richard bollollle .
imagine these dots could actually start flying .
i smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
these are the kinds of questions that we have to face .
i was fascinated by the elephant and beauty of biology .
and i can tell you , it was a change experience .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
and this is from an economist . so he &apos;s logically .
i mean , how much do we honor our memories ?
the more money you earn happiness you are .
that all of our survival with the survival of every single one is connected .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a pause .
right , bryan , the judge has magicians .
and yes , i have a task , as you might recognize .
secondly , photos should have the same lighting of lighting .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
for example , this person who is completely logical .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be made of it .
i have . the first picture is a picture of my family .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the film of statements .
and the film is going to be called &quot; the science of blood . &quot;
i &apos;m jessi and this is my suitcase .
just that i think it &apos;s more like , not true .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy it . thank you very much .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why do we fight this ?
that &apos;s a lot of towns , 20 , per hour .
so there should be better at the beginning of my death .
because they &apos;re the people who are also experts for taste .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
i mentioned this at miguel , and he was kidnapping .
so the furniture the more the system . &quot;
and then i think of it immediately , that &apos;s unfair .
and also , what you would think today in the spirit .
and the oil will replace us by others by energy .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not able to do it .
like algae -- and other terrible things .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
it was completely closed that it could fail .
so that really throws me right , and i wanted to do more .
and immediately , i see another pattern that is available .
yeah , this is a little bit down there .
it &apos;s not resource efficiency , it &apos;s more effective .
we &apos;ve been using over three years now .
and if you can , i will find some of the strange ones .
i know now that it was the reason of the sea .
and that was the first time i learned this .
i studied a printer and she was in breathtaking .
and the time i gathered more and more knowledge .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 , when a vacuum 300 .
in 2010 , we had just connected two billion people online .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our justice system .
and the lighting path through the rest of the book .
&quot; because she &apos;s been holding this morning , &quot; he said .
we have the capital of the techno-philanthropic philanthropy .
this approach is true for anything that we &apos;re doing creative .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
now , your living self will not become happier .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
here &apos;s a picture of an orchid in kentucky .
he &apos;s got a feed of 15 .
i can say the canadian is a man .
we &apos;ve been moving forward before in the so-called avian age .
this is about 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
this is the audience that we just finished recently .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
but you can , if you &apos;re in a foreign foreign .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
and all of a sudden he seemed no longer in human being .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
or do you want to be more powerful , more force .
and i don &apos;t mean just less successful , even though that &apos;s heard .
my great-grandparents died when they were 60 .
now , where are we going to go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
that &apos;s kind of like all of the delusion of delusion .
and of course , you can never give it to germany . &quot;
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
and the more i talked about , the more i should tell you .
and i celebrate , i wine like a little child .
obviously that &apos;s not going to fit everything into my tiny little suitcase .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re pulling other happy people .
gamers are in spiders in spiders of social networks .
how can we transfer these feelings from play into reality ?
so it was made out of the same , bad team of one of the best .
the fact is that this insecure should make us worry .
so people in the west really thought about creativity for a long time .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
one of them was that the phone was never broken .
according to his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
a few months were going on , and i had just forgotten everything .
even who kills someone , it &apos;s not just a killer .
for example , the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
and this video was actually already finished in january .
each of these themes , of course , has lots of smaller decisions .
there are many other ones , but i &apos;m missing the time .
today , i want to tell you about circles and openings .
they &apos;re interacting with their surroundings and their experiences .
this trick can lead to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
you know , there was no mandarin paradise .
yes , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
it &apos;s all that &apos;s beautiful in life , it &apos;s not efficient .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting .
i apologize that i have to bend so strong .
second , what economists call percussion .
and i think that &apos;s what the world looks like .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
so it doesn &apos;t change anything , and yet it changed .
we &apos;ve just overtaken the 7-billionaire .
and then let &apos;s try this analogy in the future .
so , if you ask the light again .
it was a store that was called wire .
are you so far ? you see a little nervous .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
the things that are only used are going to go into technical systems .
so the device that you see there doesn &apos;t work .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean coal technology .
they did that by providing the country .
bryan venson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
welcome the fear of welcome . watch the risk of welcome .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
there &apos;s just the second best , the firefighters .
they can throw away from where they go and stand .
an amazing error . one out of nine innocent .
i want to give you two , maybe three examples of present .
very rarely , you actually become a wheelchair of a wheelchair .
this is somebody in the remaining four days of 10 .
we used to be used to the fact that things happen linear .
i had a 14-year-old , poor young black men as mandela .
you &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the gangs .
and then people could eat it and not be blind .
because this is where the actual government work is happening .
&quot; 2.5 to one what ? what &apos;s your feet ? &quot;
and then we started negotiating with insulin .
the conventional system all over the world looks like this .
i play explained what these sounds could mean .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re helping asking people for a second .
but also , our perception of how they deceive us , because too .
and other examples are the ambitious , smart systems .
how many doors have the house where they live ?
we think it &apos;s clean -- and also greece .
i believe it and i feel like we should teach that .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
some people were disappointed that it was not a poetry .
i sent them home without talking to my doctor .
the cost of solar energy fell in the last 50 percent .
we need to be committed to the government of government .
there &apos;s a direct sequence for this .
the software takes off of software in a few years .
and clearly we can find fastest chains .
cats look at cats that look at this video .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
and what happened was i needed a experts .
looks pretty much like old-fashioned fashion .
i just wish i could see my kids grow up .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
it has eyewitness of life , one after the other .
and i talked to her to fund a expedition .
we &apos;re talking about the fluctuation of information overflow .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering .
well , the first year is half of his advertising .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
so they &apos;re moving around and making art installations like this .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
i was shocked , and i was crushed to the inside .
i went home to my way home .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
i say that because i think identity is very important .
because all these new technologies today feed themselves .
because their lives depend on whether they did the job right .
and these people know what we lost from the eyes .
i knew she was coming to pass .
today , we don &apos;t just find a little bit about something that we do .
a typical walmart gives you 100,000 products today .
do you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you is what is truly fantastic .
in the previous example , it was about finding detail .
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask for questions .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought in .
if it wasn &apos;t moving anymore , you &apos;ve got it buried .
would you not want to make these changes in your genes ?
what would you like to do if you could only have one ?
again , what potential do we want to call ?
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , two reasons .
if we looked at how emotion is changing with income .
and this is a little hard to justify , i think .
there was no christmas trees . we did it all .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is it .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
look at gguan , farmers like miguel .
ever heard of a farm that feeds your animals ?
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not so sure .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
the words , as long as his friends , are spoken to his .
and we found that there was a correlation in fact .
do you know how many choices you make on a typical day ?
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
so the driving force behind it is the cybersuperpower .
i didn &apos;t have two years anymore with my wife .
the pilot sent the machine to the hudson river .
the revelation is , death is a part of life .
it keeps us at the distance , and it keeps going on .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
it &apos;s about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
you see the person who asks what &apos;s going on inside .
most of my activities , i have two chickens .
as it turns out , dna synthetic is very difficult .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we think about our future as a formal reminder of memories .
now , the memory itself is a storyteller .
what it ruined was the memories of the experience .
we &apos;re going to meet in the next few days .
there &apos;s a step-b-paced-up manual .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
a fish elevator , but also a bird reserve .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love story .
this first one was more like a passionate monkey .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s disappointed it .
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate .
and most of all , first of all , to ask what is the right thing .
but i &apos;m just doing it just a little bit more curious .
i started thinking , i should just put the project in the project .
we can , of course , look at the garbage problem .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
just to precise newscores , they agree .
if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
so you can ask : how happy is the living myself ?
most of you are completely ignored by the memory of the self .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
has a single audience in the audience ever seen a massage ?
it &apos;s the question of whether you can get it to zero .
you can test it after my talk in your room .
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum , very diverse ideas .
and she asked him what is because your hobbies ?
so , in every store , you can get the things back .
so the question is , how do we deal with these windmills ?
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
so , for example , shy the environment , less car .
and life lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
so when i put them on the side , they get their interest .
do i look like i could just write a song ?
she said it would be like a threshold of air .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
and you say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
you add a blue to a green one , and you can make light .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition goes very quickly .
yet , we &apos;re still coming to the galapagos islands .
more and more people came in , because they were angry .
it was fear of terror , the life of her life .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
we have a lot of cells that are not linked to themselves .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot of it later .
and what &apos;s below is what we call bureaucracy .
but where would the next aed to help this patient ?
they have to make 62 different decisions to design their car completely .
well , don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go like that .
almost as if we were to prepare our lives for it .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego room .
i was the only one who could talk to the airplanes .
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
think of this as an image , as a flying point .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going to do .
this will affect politics , i think , in the coming years .
we found this in terms of happiness .
they evaporate their urine . they almost never do .
usually most people start to orient themselves into the task .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize .
if you walk , yeah , everyone destroys footprints the floor .
if we overrun it , we can shake a little bit .
the most powerful mountain worker is the director of massey .
this is most of the coal in west virginia .
there &apos;s a magnet . i don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe this is an artificial species to read an e-book .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
because marine protected areas , we &apos;re basically returning the past .
i want to close with a story that really excited me .
sometimes i lift the balance . a story to conclude .
i found that technology should be possible and not kill .
so we &apos;ve now restored the timeline again .
so today evolution can happen in time period of microseconds .
here , he lifts a rare glimpse .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
we could reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
autocolors , outside of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
they don &apos;t even come from the museums .
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
i really like your way , sergey brin .
i became the miracle part of this day .
it &apos;s called eyew , and you can see the description .
this is the average size of a greenland ice cream .
i mean , what does anyone do with so many output ?
and as a general term , we can use the word for treating sexuality .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think it &apos;s happening .
we all need to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , he &apos;s called miguel .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to do today &apos;s pile is to go first .
and then the same thing happens in a good conversation .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
we take images of this mini-big bang all the detectors .
economists call this a partisan improvement .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what enables us to make modern progress .
the way to maximize choice is to maximize .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
this is a whole book , an example of non-m data .
and of course , we all share the same adaptation .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s happened in the fine direction of inferotar .
there are cases in front of us , like the intangia .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
innovation , creativity , creativity and development is not just coming out of our heads .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
ceos are about average . but this is where it gets interesting .
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
this is one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
this deputy ran over to the elderly black .
i don &apos;t know how recipient people will be .
you &apos;re about the block and you take it out as a revelation .
so at the end of two weeks , we went back to the pace .
bonobos are related to chimpanzees with our nearby chimpanzees .
the first of these is a contradiction , towards complexity .
they invest a lot of their time in the assembly of the growing structures .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little is going to be supported .
usually you &apos;re just dancing , and some are not .
now he mentioned the mineral needs of physical lankton .
i take the breathing of the audience , consciously or unconscious .
you feel that &apos;s the real truth behind the origin .
but the question i want to throw out is : why not ?
and the best thing about it is that we might expect in health .
this is technology supported innovation that there are today .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so difficult , so painful .
wr wants to help people who were convicted .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
how did he get to look for this particular kind of help ?
let &apos;s jump back quickly to moma again in new york .
tempt is going to be part of the show , which is pretty tired .
we &apos;re producing androgen and we &apos;re talking to androgens .
and when you make it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this is skandals , and we should be ashamed .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple practice .
but as you &apos;ve talked to different people in the world about these possibilities .
they have a renewable energy rate of five percent today .
and they did it with this so-called lead-maps .
but crucial is when i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so i &apos;ve been busy busy doing what is natural or intuitive .
and these are just the biohacker , the individual people .
it means we have a cultural impact beside the scientific achievement .
this struck me when i wanted my jeans to exchange .
he invited the king from sider to dinner .
but somehow , we &apos;re getting away from this problem .
and that &apos;s also what i had in half last year .
but instead of being in panic , he just stopped .
how about tears that we can &apos;t even predict ?
if you look at the people they have to do with .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
imagine that every single person is controlled by people .
okay , let me put you a little bit of blood for you .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
new investment to create well paid jobs .
six : social waste . speaker : 65 deaths .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with me like this and play .
that means that the player is safe from 10 faiths .
a long time ago , there was gray whales -- 500 years ago .
in many , you &apos;re going to say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
the x-rays of a piece of a piece is this comparable .
i looked at the janitors from my eye , and i saw the janitors going up and down .
light bulbs in a glass , i always found quite exciting .
for example , this image , for example , has about 10 billion dots , i think .
so i decided when i was 15 , deaf .
here i &apos;m going to tell you something . we &apos;re looking at exactly here at the center .
and within less years , lego went into every household .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
i haven &apos;t learned that in my work as a lawyer , by the way .
and i want to show you my outbreak for this week .
56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t come from court .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely new .
i asked him how he &apos;s become such a fish experts .
there was the core research leobeds .
this time is talking about an anecdote that you might know .
no longer required to sing a joke or a whistle .
and six milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is a lot further back in the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
so i think it &apos;s a very unsadable hack .
i think somehow , you know , shots or something like that .
this actually has taken only a thousand in eight really form , this networks .
finally , a solution that is large enough to solve our problems .
so , this looks like a basketball plaque .
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
i wouldn &apos;t have been able to do it better . i don &apos;t have left me .
now , in fact , the number of violent crime doesn &apos;t change very much .
i first eaten it in a restaurant in southern spain .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
it was always so inspiring , so refugees .
the death penalty in america is defined by irritum .
turn the garbne on the side . went home .
so this airport alone has a surface of 100 square kilometers .
i like things that are special . i like weird things .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
so maybe you should , before the interview , a little bit of that . &quot;
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leaders .
this is a clip of this attack .
we got his bed so he can see outside .
we degraded a human being that has value for our society .
we use games to get the suffering of the real world .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust into the system .
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take this . why not ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : you .
the secret is that the game is the key to this skills .
this is actually the real waste of man and machine .
a few . probably like many creative people here .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
they produced the highest construction in the least of time .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of tons for each planet on the planet .
i grew up with a wooden science fiction .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re going to build siv , not intensive .
so here was finally a company trying to do it right .
the component is always going to be more and more to the friend you live with .
and i &apos;m not so sure they &apos;re really going to stay tired .
the interesting thing is , if i can make a little trip .
there was , i think , a very good code .
in fact , nasa has shown that there are many of them out there .
they like to increase the paralysis and sensations of happiness .
now , i wondered , how can i really get this up ?
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all the minerals .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view of the world .
somebody was broken , and the system had fostered .
photographs like this : a building along a much ridge road .
the biggest fear was feared before piracy , rape and death .
so it turns out it &apos;s very hard to get all these extensions out .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange land road .
but from that , it &apos;s a very good meditation opportunity .
i brought seven of them together , and that &apos;s all .
but a lot of people get caught in a very strange position .
our gut is a wonderful friendly environment for these bacteria .
now , the two ways of throw two terms out of happiness .
well , the living self lives his life continuously .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness .
it &apos;s just a bundle calories . it &apos;s mighty .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
ah , the majority . that &apos;s what i like to see as a doctor .
my inspiration comes from an event , which is 2,500 years back .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
now , what about the placebo effect ?
smallpox . the smallpox have killed billions of people on this planet .
it &apos;s the renewables of how often they &apos;re called .
this is a fish elevated in the southern western corner .
because i &apos;m asking , how is it that was more profitable ?
the notites have the function of the letters of a writing .
then these are lasers of the pre-industrial cultures .
that means you navigate navigating about sound and rhythm .
so that &apos;s just one application of many that you can do with it .
and then we created this kind of cooperation that we did .
last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
this is what we call in our lab , perceptive design .
54 percent of the deaths cut through drilling .
basically , the concrete building became the building of our time .
how about a new sentence , never before are hearing voices .
how can a judge turn someone into something that he &apos;s not ?
in many areas , people had to have fear of lynmobs .
so programs that can make up the former numerous animals .
for example , the fish had been recorded on a glorious flight .
opportunities that were not allowed to be explicitly encouraged .
so i was going to do this a couple of years ago .
finally , at the end of the presence , we should be monitoring the willingness .
an eighty , verke . how is your brand ?
why is it important to start ? what &apos;s the red ?
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely displaced by limitations .
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
now , in this night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
and the key indicator for this is the extinction of languages .
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s no such a test .
and this is called androgenic receptor .
we &apos;re developing a collaborative credibility , heart nature .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
at the moment , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about genetic change .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
so i offered a $ 100,000 price on software for the winner .
one day this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
there was no piano at the time when the instrument was not a piano .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
even if you were to shoot now , you would have emissions .
most people know the most people know this from the software wareter .
this is actually live in the internet . you can test it .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nunvals .
but nothing was invented , that would leave me up until now .
and the best part is that they connect with magnets .
some of my sons happened in the last five years .
i looked in the wheel , and it was a little bit embarrassed .
so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said , in this particular tongue .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
so the dramatic figures come to the prisoners of prison .
i &apos;ve given some talks to germany about death penalty .
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkeys today . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
this is my wboy waking . a very simple thing .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
what context is to think about the thoughts and feelings of themselves ?
and when the threats are dangerous , then really bad things can happen .
and this urgency , this goal , has changed my life .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
if we don &apos;t take any phosphorus and give it away .
this piece of 50 years of old technology became the magical thing for me .
but youtube is more than 48 hours of video per minute .
if they could do it for the people , they could also help me .
and just so disappeared all of these companies , one after the other .
i &apos;m sad that we never know each other as adults .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one deserves us about this .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big thing .
and so when we think about it , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of individual capitalism .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individual alism .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go to the house .
if you could have one of them , it would be a very different world .
specialized skills and processing skills and their combination lead to success .
people here have contributed to the development of this miracle .
and somehow we need to get change to zero .
we still find other odds of what their rights are .
this is the dream of most perceptions we have .
this is our youngest bean tester down there .
at the end of march , the lhc will be able to be able to do .
and this is the message i took in medical college .
you know how to call a 3,000-pound in baseball ?
i think that in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
if someone lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
and so i think the ted community should be a horse .
and she &apos;s spreading away , organic , of course .
my friends from honduras asked me to say , thank you ted .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
well , finally , the film has a very big deal with it .
this is actually just a period of two and a half weeks .
these people will be connected to the film forever -- forever .
so all these green areas , these are the targets .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; college . &quot;
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of god to become a far more lost .
i went to the car and was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
in the short time here , i realized that ted has a identity .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good set of intuition to actually do experiments .
in my opinion , mass incorporates have changed our world .
this is all reality today , and in the future , will be much more possible .
so that allows us to assemble the assembly of commitment , trust and trust .
here it says , the more you overwhelm , the better .
people said , do you have no fear of never succeeding ?
i don &apos;t remind you of me , but i can live with it .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely unfinished .
i love this : &quot; watson forcing human enemy . &quot;
i looked at her and ridiculous , but she looked very serious .
three months later , i moved around , and the adventure went on .
it &apos;s about creating needles out of scarf goods .
i like a lot of black colors , lots of gray sounds and stuff like that .
and his brother said , &quot; i want to just talk to tony .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impulse for the flyte .
and the question was : how could you connect technology to connect new technology to it ?
for example , i don &apos;t want to give you the same rights as people .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
and that &apos;s something that we need to learn , and that &apos;s very fast .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s feeding concert .
the man is supposed to be the monkey ancestor or a common ancestor .
and loud signs , f and b , etc .
how were his circumstances , how did society and politics ?
on september 10th , last year , the machine ran the first time .
we have littletted kids , and they &apos;re looking at them .
and when i listened to her , she made crucial noises .
and i was good at claude .
but when i ask you , how do you do that with your wife ?
you collect information about the piece in the seafood .
there &apos;s a lot of people working there with them , and they can all be engaged .
but how would it be if the image connects you to all your images ?
you say that you never die of the name of those who never die .
but it does something that doesn &apos;t do other regional technologies .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
so i sat down , and you played the tedtalk .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
we should be able to rotate everything we want .
and i tend to see my shadow as a shadow .
we &apos;ve done some studies in order to see if that &apos;s true .
you can see what enormous speeds there are .
this is a natural mice from asia , where all of japan comes from japan .
because a good engineer has either built great cars or nuclear power plants .
this was the first beginning of a musical expression .
you can only have numerous missions if you &apos;re not there .
it &apos;s good . the question is , how will we go ?
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
the official faith of all western industrialized societies .
&quot; do you remember the patient you met after your home ? &quot;
we live on a planet that covers 70 percent water .
just swap the construction of housing against the cities .
that &apos;s how to lie , that you can just apply that logic .
often the music class is so that you learn to read the notes .
that &apos;s just the letters that you learned to paint .
8 : tsunami warning . 9 : cyberattacks .
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
bruno guisi : mark , mark , come back .
just when it doesn &apos;t seem hard to play , perhaps most of the time .
so we don &apos;t have to control the people , be slightly bad .
now , there &apos;s all this rumbber from the great overwhelming .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
they knew about any kind of bits and industrial , which they had to attack .
it was as italy won the football world championship .
in our constraints , we are in all sorts of uncomfortable areas .
and she was much worse for a than for b in memory .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who has more listed ? &quot;
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we do it , tell stories .
a disappointment becomes a little bit more common because somebody perceives it this way .
why ? because we don &apos;t have child paralysis . and do you know what ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
if i &apos;m not right , then the canadian is not a man .
you &apos;re learning first to read that before you just talk a word .

i &apos;ve all made these films , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
it &apos;s something between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
well , with seventh 10 , you have no memories , but no significant memories .

you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says everything is connected to everything .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this has been mentioned so often here today .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
if you turn on the lights , it looks like this . so just as we saw it before .
imagine the screen could just appear in different formats or size , in different solutions .
so i started thinking about what it is that what these games are doing to us .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to reach the needle .
and what the marshmalware does is it helps them to identify hidden assumptions .
they do that because they can follow the strike white line of the country a92 .
i &apos;m convinced you &apos;re kind of going to the nostalgia , to wonder .
and what we can read almost every day in the daytime , which you find in this third sentence .
one example of this is a very different area . monet has painted the erox of malx .
and i want to say to protocoll that i &apos;ve been here for my part of the jobs here today .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genomphi 174 .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique case of the gene , the rhythm of the dance of everybody in every culture .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order of that information .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it &apos;s never real than it is today that it &apos;s less .
i thought , &quot; well , imagine the camera would mean that we wanted to lead a background .
so , for example , the number four 164 pencils out of this code ; you can &apos;t see it .
no , they don &apos;t have the building ; it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
when these dots fall down , they can write on it , they can show patterns , images , text .
our cities were taken in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
for bonobos and humans , life doesn &apos;t matter and claws alone .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this stuff like , for example .
to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved by the congress .
if you put an explicitly administrator on the team , they will be significantly better .
bill gross has several companies , among other things called esolar , has the great solar thermal technologies .
one is the energy edited that these technologies are creating dramatically as the power of power .
that means that 15 pounds are necessary to get a pounds of tuna tuna .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s going on with a normal , regular electrochemical battery battery .
a tv or a washing machine that uses you just don &apos;t need .

the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view , the fish knows something .
and this was an example of what our own governments do for us to use technology , citizens .
we want to fight precaution and discrimination in the criminal justice system .
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually made .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
and what we &apos;ve actually done is we &apos;ve started humanity , we &apos;ve started to abstract .
that &apos;s because the government is like an ocean , and politics are the top 150s .
at the end of a tags , i cook a giant top soup that we shared .
something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice like this slide .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , as long as you &apos;re not a particle physicist .
either &quot; flarist , &quot; or &quot; a paradise , &quot; they will have the choice .
you can &apos;t just tell enough concrete how critical this factor for the quality of a human being can be .
by interacting with each other , by interacting with each other , it can be interacting the characters in one another .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no shores in their treatment .
i came to think of it as we got up to our ups and cameras from it .
how can we keep them longer -- better fresh , more fresh , fresh , three times .
and the side of the kidneys of androgene genes , which are the fourth hormones .
i was the second volunteer at the branding , so i had a pretty good opportunity to be able to go into it .
and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution are slowly fast , but they &apos;re unenveloped .
players love to become part of awe of the abundance of abundance of abundance .
so , what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are masterpieces .
you know , there are two countries that are control almost percent of phosphorus in the world .
in china , a descent chopf is still using honey , you know , right ?
it actually took some years to start with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
and the preparation was enormous . we had to build cameras and design them .
but what voodoo does is this vital relationship between the living and the dead .
because obviously , a animal that was very common , first of all before it dies .
and sometimes when something comes to ted , it gets a meaning and force that otherwise would not have .
you have to make the sound of the winds , they &apos;re throwing away and read the rest of the book .
well , i &apos;m optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen here .
they don &apos;t fight that struggle that we all struggle to talk about ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
you might think that &apos;s just a landscape image , and the bottom part was manipulated .
and the next piece is four women in three generations who build together a new life .
the one on the left is jazz and the right is the right thing , but you know what ?
just to give you the extent , i zoom out , so you can see what you get .
and as part of it , it gave us a concept of anatomic common origin .
or are we going to get something else -- something that might be even better adapted to the environment ?
i really hope that we play meaningful games together to survive on the planet another century .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing and cold itself to us who can afford it .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same ratio to progress .
the idea of this is not just that the machine serencing the control in controversy .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- i &apos;m really looking out of the socks .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with winds ; they are based on a completely different technology .
now , when i was in college , i had my first biology class .
and this is half of the water problems in the world that are caused by textile industry .
this is almost entirely low-income security -- perhaps for the fish , definitely for us .
in this country , there are children in our country for children who live longer lives without condition .
here &apos;s what we need to do under policeman &apos;s license , again , to bring it back .
we need to prevent the people from long things , especially when they &apos;re true .

already today , in some flat lakes , in alaska , alaska methane , even from the water .
for her , she had presented a job : the floods of her family and a new life in australia .
and in reality , when we fail , when we fail on obstacles , we feel very often different .
to this archaic modular model , we heard a principle of natural ratio .
as a child , i had collected collections of sticks , stones , boxes and shells .
and so , from the interest , in this technology , i went on and on and on and on .
so , for example , we developed an eight-footprint that is at room temperature .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not in obvious , but maybe you can &apos;t help the france a little bit .
in high school , a student told me that brian goldman would learn for a blueprint .
i &apos;m going to focus on a statistics that i hope most of you have heard of .
so if we look at the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and like a lot of people , i thought it was mostly about choosing people to choose .
so it &apos;s all the tools , and the only thing that we face is our imagination .
if someone asked them to describe their identity , their brand , their personality , how would they be ?
so basically , when you look at something that &apos;s impossible , that &apos;s impossible , you can do it .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn from this week is that it &apos;s okay to let it go .
and maybe we know only from what wood we cut when we &apos;re really test .
a third sentence that appears immediately when people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
it &apos;s called old-fashioned law , or ubiquitous psychology , which also affects us in perception .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re dealing with next to what you &apos;re doing as an age of age .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
i can accelerate the whole sequence by accelerating the speed in one or another .
this question was so profound that we decided to explore the answer of the answer and the developed developed developed developed developed developed .
we say , &quot; computers , generous please take hundreds of millions of numerous sequences of instructions .
do they make the easy to use , and they start with this patient , in the team .
and i think the most important point is that we &apos;ve stopped talking to our patients .
so maybe we &apos;ll sell a shoe , and he &apos;s going to have the greatest shoe you ever wear ...
why not have the quick muscle muscle fibers that are going to allow them to go faster and longer ?
we know that we work as human beings , when we work hard , we make meaningful work .
we know from this study that you have to access to the needle if you want to go to the thing .
i brought you an example of the north american embassy of the noottoan indian .
maybe to a aging talk about the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative act .
we now have almost an infinite choice in telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century so that we can predict the development .
yes , i &apos;m scared of privileged , quietly , silly , advising .
so we could just end up with dumb , maybe hundreds of new cities .
when i returned 27 years later , the fish shrinked half of its size .
well , morgan , in the name of transparency : what happened to the 7100 ?
it &apos;s almost impossible to be bad at being poor , if you &apos;re wearing red red pants .
do we use these decisions to shape a society that is better , the successful is , the friendly ?
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change your cells ?
this also shows the value of this talk , which is why i hope i &apos;ve got wet to you .
but in fact , my research at the institute for the future is exactly the opposite of it .
nothing goes into my sleeves or comes out , not a trickster . and you can study everything .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics that made me not fantasy at all .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often as a &quot; traveling wave reactor . &quot;
i remember last year when i took mosquitos and somehow liked people .
it &apos;s important for the age that most of the time in the first semester , the great laws .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from this melting water .
that &apos;s great . the tube didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
the viral particles were then released by the cells , and came back and killed . coli .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve adapted this point to the choice of our common choice .
well , you can see , in all cases , nobody has to be a slower candidate .
most of the mass extinctions in this country didn &apos;t really find the class of violent crimes .
this endgame is going to propose that money is going to invest more security and security .
police officers came in and highly representative forests and offices .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could have written by hand .
so for me , it seemed to be more likely to be at the right place at the right time .
and this sadness really formed in a thought , which is that i just wish one thing .
and by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since , as i have to say , very successful leadership .
you don &apos;t sit around and around and around , and there &apos;s always a very important thing to do .
our memory tells us stories , which means that what we need from our experience is a story .
do you say that there are negative effects that have to do with clouds that make things different ?
this is kind of the deadline that the environmental models that we have to hold .
and also , although it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need a fuel -- you &apos;ve got some parts .
you &apos;re assure that they &apos;re not going to join me , in fact , they &apos;re not going to leave the glass .
so a lot of people come and look at this because you can see what problems you can get .
she heard about this book of charles darwin , the origin of the species and the descendants of man .
i promised my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , oma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
evolution is all about genomes of genomes next generation , adaptation and generation after generation .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- up to my physician .
now , if i had ever opened the anchor to the 600 pictures , i would have spent another hour in it .
people are going to believe in their faith , and that &apos;s the fact that you can &apos;t free them .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design shop .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor that seems to be difficult , but maybe they &apos;ll tell us about us .
so here we see this again , again , the el again , again , the whole , single gaggregation .
view : now , i &apos;m sort of interacting with the object , can zoom out again , zooming .
sounds like banal , but it &apos;s very exciting when you &apos;re closer to it .
because often people come , they can &apos;t make use of the user , so that everybody can deal with it .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of rabble and boggles .
when we think about biological processes , or some process to replace this will be a huge challenge .
when you break down the gold glass , everything is possible , you satisfy the happiness .
if i go into a space -- like now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me .
but finally , i decided to wear my god , i have to go to court and wear this crazy case .
it was recently done a study with ceos in which they observed a week for the ceos .
so we overcome our brains , because our brain doesn &apos;t just accept that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
i got another gift to see in the future , and come back and live differently .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , do we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
so we have the memory itself , and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
unfortunately , that &apos;s the whole good news , because there &apos;s some other problems , and they &apos;re often mentioned .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much on our energy without changing your lifestyle .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i just got two years later to face when we moved to california .
so you need the learning process of music language as long as it is for the spoken language .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put these little pieces together , and we could correct the mistakes .
we managed to spend about a hundred genes of genes on the 500 or something that are here .
and this really attacks these ideas , these limitations for the available space on the screen .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species might have existed for 600,000 years .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us out .
we developed an app for layar , extended reality to find these eds .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , that i &apos;m going to tell you about the wireless way .
we use this great euphemism , try and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some of the interesting things that happened since the start .
so if you &apos;re lucky enough to maximize the two species of self , you will end up doing very different things .
as peter told us , they not only produce the highest domain , but also the most interesting structures of all .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a divine record .
we hope that this is not a pop-ups and other nonsense -- that should not be necessary .
the grandfather of the man didn &apos;t worry about the arctic night or the hurricane .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 stones for each person on this planet .
and to win , this needs to be a better diagnosis than a team of highly qualified doctors .
the founding fathers were from my view of the original atomic activists , and that &apos;s why .
they played a worthy field , and they had to break the seventh adventure .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are the success of scientific method .
it would have been without the world war ii , but it &apos;s still so much more important .
certainly , i would never achieve an alien world with a spacecraft , which seems to me pretty unlikely .
that &apos;s not what we &apos;re going to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening right now .
all right , just to conclude , i want to notice that i talked a lot about the fathers .
who knows when the movie comes out , we might see a hormone folder .
what are we going to do with the fact that we &apos;re going to tell you about just a few nucleotides ?
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and then raise my strength and execute .
but if you &apos;re in an epic adventure , and you say , &quot; let &apos;s get the oil out of it . &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have never existed there before as a human potential .
and that &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon children will die from that , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
in the rich world , diseases that have threatened millions of us just before a generation , not yet .
here we see a very fundamental service . is there any way to read light , so you can read the homework ?
the greeks called the divinity of creativity .
and i find it dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how it &apos;s taken into the next century .
and in this , we install an evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going on in the microsecond sediment area .
so in other words , the future of every year has shrinked me since i am on this world .
they shoot the decision -- shoot them on their own , even when it comes to their own best interest .
so , these things -- you know , people are remembered -- this is kind of why we &apos;re interested .
if you surround yourself with the right people , you will not only understand it , you will also appreciate it .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said that they were riding this model exactly .
one way of thinking about it is interesting , and which i used in the last time is , is evolution itself .
we had a team of locks in boston for example , the code for code .
so , imagine if you were at the same time in several places , how would that feel ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
so the nerve cells are built in the information processing process that these cell communities have built .
so , it was possible to bring us to the small digital head with the rotoral connection .
echina eaca , a little antioxioxidic , which helps you to get on the springs .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about has to do with the fact that they deceive themselves .
if professors are becoming curious , they will often be slaughtered in this kind of research metic ocean .
this is what &apos;s happening in the machine age , and this is the book , and it &apos;s happened to be the photo oliver .
and it &apos;s about solving a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and we think that we &apos;re going to be the first fueled generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
it turns out that it really meant to be , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do anything about your film . &quot;
the moment it was , as if a film director had demanded a constant change .
that &apos;s as if i said , shake your child , it &apos;s only three times more than five times .
and the main lesson that we think we &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
but there are no versions of which we can look around , where you learn how to fire .
his cause is writing the piece of writing , is going to be more and more and more to my personal , playing .
but these concepts of cyber-age that will allow us to rediscover these kinds of possibilities back to rediscover our skills .
so this is a way to survive longer , and they multiply in size .
and so just these words that we use in language as well as politically correctly .
the first example is ahead of what many of you know and some of you appreciate , very few people don &apos;t need at all .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could do a or we could do b .
i &apos;d like to explain to you with this mechanism today or something that &apos;s unlikely to be familiar with you .
so now , i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite images , serious worker of the breeder .
but now , when you get evidence , you have to think about this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
for example , in obvious bach , the garbage is one percent of the waste between wind .
but again and again , very rare , something special happened . one of the persuasions was actually overwhelmed .
my heart , i was delicious , while i was trying to summarize what was happening to me .
the human part of this bug , far from the end , of course , is what we &apos;re interested in most of us .
immediately you &apos;re going to be able to tell you , for those of you who are predictable , you can &apos;t prove .
they reformed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that will have changed a lot of biology at a time .
and because you &apos;re obsessed with the spirit of your mind , how can you be harm ?
for those non-engineers , littlettletted a different material , electronics was just another material .
so , what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the community bring us together ?
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is indiscriminate , but also very time-consuming .
and every time it was divided , it was to distribute chemicals in the same way .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic outcome .
so i wanted to create something else that starts when the process is expressed .
and if you take a picture with a camera that ends if you stick on the outside .
but my interest in photography when i received my first digital camera in the age of 15 years .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break into 20 parts of how you know it from documentaries .
i spent a lot of my life trying to try to be myself , to be myself , and to adapt me at the same time .
but not just that -- that &apos;s what they do , and they connect with the universe and other devices out there .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world .
there are so strictly controversial things like this whole genetic changing plants on the inside .
if anybody had built a 550-foot construction , he would have contributed the price to home .
i met mr , in 2008 , two years ago , in walt disney hall .
and yes , the debate is always about the question , how far you can take a piece of future .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go back into circles .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to get treated when i &apos;m going to be interrupted .
you can get rid of your own museum -- from all these images , you can put your own collection on .
so , in the big and all of us , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have what the goal is .
well , a light bulb is usually a thing to find out , because you &apos;ve dropped it somewhere somewhere .
so the idea is that we actually empower the people with the things they do together , collectively , collective .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the head of the development department of a nonprofit organization called robin .
it &apos;s about how happy or joyful the person is when this person thinks about their lives .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and they produce really drought .
because the soil is going to die off the mosses , and the wind is going to pick the water off .
so you &apos;re just being put into the citizens , you &apos;re just going to sit down with these scientific technologies .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a small explanation of what you see in the same way .
this is one of the images we kept in with the so-called gigapple technology .
now , since the film on sundaning film premier , we can look at that .
and every time i interviewed somebody , i can say , &quot; are you happy enough for this interview ?
ice mountains are born as calf of a glacier , or they break out of ice sheets .
so in this project , we actually designed some small marker to track the trash through the system .
our language enters the social change that have been solved in many cases by a technological change .
but danny , in the entire american aspire , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
i know that we can , and as far as it is , something that needs the world now .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccine for the new yorker , a little article .
so the performance is working with prototypes , much , but let &apos;s see how we operate the teams .
and even though it seems really simple , it &apos;s really hard to do because people are doing very quickly .
there are very , very few things that you can say at all that there &apos;s a chance in a million .
and i noticed how very deep these deep cracks , a space respiratory mission .
that was the cause . it was the rightion . it was the business of american agriculture .
when i get to my little piv , and i go wrong , this feeling goes up .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , be alone .
we made small pieces , made a error correction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
did you find a paper with falcon , you could feel the copyright idea of that thought .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the river , as nobody ever could have predicted .
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , oma . i promise it . &quot;
i &apos;ve tried to make it clear , as valuable cities are around how much valuable they are than they are .
and it seemed to be preferred with these gray boxes , these real-time systems .
and you &apos;re going to give them all the nutrients that they could only wish without any effort .
when a spirit has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new forms .
maybe that &apos;s exactly the meaning of vienity , a perception of iconic , a sense of our own force .
the challenge offers a shared experience , a common language . baseline to build the right prototype .
if you have 10 teams that are typically going forward , you get about six , the stable structures have .
and there &apos;s certainly unclear about how bad these are going to follow , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
if we can do this , this will all be a new source of information , maybe a new source of information .
this is really important because this is an insight that doesn &apos;t exist in a single wikipedian .
in holland , you know , of course , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with virtuality so well .
and they contain selected from rare plants , so they contribute to the biodiversity .
the electronics had a dozen components , and you can see the diversity that emerged out of it .
we had a team that worked last year at a project in boston , for three people two and a half months .
and the first thing i asked is , &quot; tell me how the opportunities are different from each other .
from the people who were in love when it was 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass box .
in 2010 , a friend of guatemala , vio vio came to the tedtalk of tedtalk .

so , i decided to visit one day to the filiter , and i asked the head of this model , &quot; does this model work that you offer all these people to really do ? &quot;
the head of the congress came up and said , &quot; professor romer , i thank you for your talk , but maybe we might look at the tedtalk .
we need to make these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time and go to the future , we will be happy to have done that .
so , again , i stood up with a small team on unknown terrain . we drew &quot; avatar , &quot; with a new technique that had not happened before .
and then we don &apos;t have that one , but that &apos;s like , i think , it &apos;s pretty good for people who are there right there .
i mean , it can sound odd to think that a thing at the same time is two different places , but they were born with this idea , they have evolved .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all about what it takes us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; -- to a &quot; ta-da &quot; moment .
but the latest pile came back to me , and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not going to be able to make this happen .
i was seventh 10 when i was on one of his courses once again , and i played the last four balkans in chopin , in a late work .
when your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at everything for you . everybody knew that you had this physical genius that helped you .
in nine people we &apos;ve executed , one that we &apos;ve done for unguessed , that &apos;s been thrown out of death and from death .
so an organism was able to learn , for example , to eat a particular frustration , because she did bad and made him sick , the last time he ate them .
personally , i get def . it &apos;s easier to create a place than find a place , because you don &apos;t have to go into any compromise with the ideas in your head .
because it &apos;s about how to encounter people in interactive media so they can use these interactive media , and they can create a peaceful experience .
finally , this older black man came to a very concerned slide in the courthouse and sat behind me , almost on the defense bank .
there it is , you know , this plane is made up of hundreds of little bits of little bits that work together to make your security . &apos; does it not make you visible ? &quot;
one day -- this is a real report -- came into this : &quot; advice in my trunk . can &apos;t tell if she &apos;s dead .
and just as the woman who was going to know me as adults , met me , she turned into a box and became my hands .
we &apos;re going to have a process that may have invented 100,000 years in the rule , and we can compress it in a thousand years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years .
there &apos;s a number of people who have much more &quot; uh-oh moments than others , and among the worst , they are fresh b.c. wrel .
that means we &apos;re just going to see our first thing before we see it , we &apos;re going to bring it back to the back in the back of our levers to say , okay .
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a billionth of the universe at the beginning of the universe -- and to 600 million times within a second .
but they also have a secret for our future , a future where we have to adapt to increasingly challenges , through bigger creativity and creativity .
and a lot of discussions that i &apos;ve had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i &apos;ve had in the last three years , in photovoltaics .
one of the things that you do with water is that you have enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s four to six and so on .
and then something interesting happened , which was really interesting to me from jacques cousteau , which was a very unknown world on our earth .
and our european network is basically made up of just louder animals of big power plants , wherever the wave is all around europe is all around europe .
one process that -- like everybody who has ever tried to do something -- in other words , actually , everybody here -- doesn &apos;t always have a reassure .
and every year we ask the students to create products , products and services , which can live within a decade of the millennium &apos;s lives of people .
i came to the ted , because i think many of you have understood that the moral skull of the universe is far apart , but that it is the justice .
and finally , saturday : a unique , personal style , personal style is a great way of telling the world something to tell you without saying a word .
they didn &apos;t count because he was in a memory ; the memory was rut , and the memory was everything he had to keep .
i think that the molecular biology now is generally speaking , generally speaking , biotech , biotech , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
what would it be like to give the oppressed , wherever they are , they are a voice to make attention to themselves and change , for the first time ?
i love to find everybody else &apos;s opportunity to find a different colorful outfit , crazy outfit , and , in the last time , to photograph and blogging .
i said to my wife , always when a human being used in a moral justification , because we should try to replace it through the literally .
and it turns out that if you do it , something concrete feels a very good tool to save people more .
so we &apos;re not only responsible for the people we love to preserve salt and prepare them , but they prefer to get very well .
so we take something very complicated , turn it into sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the other heads .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re all over the way to eliminate the others when they get them to fire .
now , in egypt , in egypt , the plenty of april in april 2011 , the headquarters of egyptians , and they found a lot of actors .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of programmable work , nuanced and signed , tony drew , signed back to tony for the first time after seven years .
so this is what this reactor was a problem that we fill in our fill and then reducing the volume while this process is reduced .
in fact , we start from a new point of view : we have the biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by building new life and new life .
but that &apos;s what keeps me holding at night -- one of the things that woke me up at night , and we &apos;ve never really needed the progress of science as much as we have now .
according to burden , the premier in january , and since then -- and this is not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million copies of this film .
yeah , that &apos;s a huge debate at the moment , building up from coal power plants , because we don &apos;t do anything , or stores , because that &apos;s not going to happen .
a lot of our friends thought we were pretty stupid to do that , and we were all looking back and all the images on the walls were the graffiti .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake only happened in the first five years of age , which is a lot of my colleagues , but i think that &apos;s really nonsense .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government , who are paying taxes and receiving services .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very exclusive groundline , at least at the time , he was really exclusive .
in a country that has just been behind a lefty crisis , where congress has been elected to the congress for this conversion of 124 with a voice .
it seems like we &apos;re pretty remote from the other parts of life , but in fact , most of the biggest part , the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are pretty much the same .
but the logic of disappointment allows us to do it as if the first of the first sentence was a false , as if you were to take the opposite of the opposite without proof it .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert when i have the experience that i have , the piece that i make a long time working on how to experience .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up to my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to listen to you . &quot;
well , there are marks of margin and remarkable marks , these things that come and come , but it &apos;s a representative , it &apos;s a pretty strong thing .
and if you &apos;ve already gotten that the drugs of stuxtational complex is high-tech and high-tech , let me tell you : the user data is a science for yourself .
when i tell you that somebody has eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living .
now , i did a couple of people in the company , no one could give me a decent answer , until i finally did the horror of the biologists .
basically , you get every round of your round randomness of randomly misery while you &apos;re trying to form words , you &apos;re going to be able to test these words about a dictionary .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine in which i feel more comfortable with , or maybe a little less of what i &apos;ve talked to you about it .
but then another one happened , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and that was that these cells started communicating and putting information so that communities came from cells .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference , we say , in the climate .
it starts out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you &apos;re seeing is fluid and those density , those dense march .
we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous trust in our future , is the fact that we have more than individuals to face us the big challenges of our planet .
so an app that &apos;s written in a couple of days , and then spread from rare , is a kind of like the bug in front of the institution .
what that means is that if you were to meet somebody , and you would say , oh , his father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about your size ?
at this point , if you laugh , you can see how important this lie is , and how much time you need to experience something which artists can tell us very well .
how would it feel to live in a world where german had gone down the german state , especially if under unraveling jews were a lot of jews .
and because the government ultimately excludes us its strength -- he remembers you , &quot; we people ? &quot; -- how do we think about it , how change happens .
are they reliable , stable , smooth , smooth , sail , safe , sacred , sacred , how is the dalai lama or yoda ?
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychoactive parliament of the repertoire of the shame .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with interior people , whose gender breath is -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male male or female types .
we had to do that at the time . if we had children as a book , we took the description of the author and we put them on the canvas in our heads .
we came up with music . and a few days later , i got an email that was that nathaniel was interested in education for me .
and since we &apos;re giving ourselves the media campus , for example , the virtual reality in our v.r. lab , we can actually do this all the time .
i said , &quot; listen , listen , you , do you , and i both know if this book is not brilliant that it &apos;s not my fault , right ?
because it makes a lot as much sense of everything i &apos;ve heard of , if it was about explaining to explain the excitement of the creative process .
so it &apos;s so far . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that has ever been done -- 27 miles across the diameter .
and i &apos;ve argued that we may be able to create a new form of campus explosion in which there could be a massive new education based on this digital design .
the reason that it used to be better than anything was worse than bad , when everything was worse , it was possible for people to make experiences that were a pleasant .
and i would negotiate with me that if i could double my effort to double the perfect and never again a mistake that the voice could be surrounded .
so these are just a few of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it &apos;s also the last six days . or the last six years .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan them to find the different places for the puzzles of the puzzles .
but also , because it turns out that we &apos;re using this whole time to play , in fact , that we are able to change the way that we are able to human beings .
i can take the notions that the bach has had , on the modern wing , to make a baroque , which cannot embed a baroo .
already , from the german embedded in english , there can be more knowledge of knowledge , once you think about it , or even density or poetry .
bg : now we need one of these scaling , generous things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve got 20 years to invent and then put 20 years to the end .
if you &apos;re playing , you &apos;re looking at some nuances here that are zoomed up to the mouth and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprising .
you have to imagine that when you make something of the classic mobility , five hours and with this new kind of natural software just an hour .
i &apos;m a wall . i have to be able to work every day for the same time , and i swear down , and really awkward .
so they found that , according to turtle , the worker and agreed a national strategy . on a day , you would eat the next day . you would play .
the other note is that if we use the zero-sum emissions , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
the movie i sold this as &quot; romeo and julia ship on a ship , &quot; it became a love of episode , a passionate film .
so far , in discussions , these insults that are trying to make insulin , that have a small net that has the net , yes , to do with our connection and nothing .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin to build a hall that we can sort of form the electrical proportion of the island of one at three times .
that means that the interpret has to translate this unprecedented language into a different , solicitable , concrete , non-verbal language .
this is intuitive user , not only since apple has been an elementary economic factor , elementary achievement , when i just want to make technological equipment for people .
a lot of journalists called me the question , &quot; what are you going to do , what are you going to do with us , whether caster seminal proposals or male ? &quot;
well , what i hear is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them to play together some kind of game to control their health better .
and imagine even as a five-year-old child with dr. p. and so they tried to stop doing these practices , natural success without success .
bg : well , the actual spending on the research -- let &apos;s say , we should spend the u.s. 10 billion a year as they do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us work and interact , and the unexpected , which we form , are the real nutrition of creativity .
and there were no video games nor these overwhelming computers , nor the full language in the media , i had to create the images in my head .
as you knew in the village , who has had wine , and when that &apos;s happening today , this extension of our own self-assembly through these mobile devices .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to be able to take responsibility , so i would be able to worry about my patients without having to contact them .
i got a fine ticket because i &apos;m not on the bike , but often there &apos;s a disability that doesn &apos;t leave you on the way .
and so i look at myself as one of the people , in common with most other experimental quantum physics , the good logic needs to add the complex ideas together .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream . &quot;
jacques cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating shows that the animals and places and places around the world that we never could have imagined before .
and if we can , of course , we can do it for the nike , for nike and mauritz and the whole textile industry .
in every step , we &apos;ve produced these pieces in circulation so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process of what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
unlike the one-century entertainment of the 20th century , the participation of the community is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or doing something new .
my wife , my kids and i have moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and dictionaries and archives , and our house has taken over .
we can go out and look at a step further , and then we can look at the data and see that circular disease and cancer are common suspects , but not for everyone .
90 percent of the big fish we love , the tunas , the tunas , the healing , the salmon , heavy fish , they collapsed .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has doubled more than doubling the inflation of infant income in the world has tripled three times .
one of the areas that we see in both of the world &apos;s contributions , in our culture today , in the united states today , are the fighting over the beginning and the end of life .
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul &apos;s walking around and talking about vaccines and saying , how valuable they are , and that people should just stop getting jamie .
the second one is an experience of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s between his life and happiness and his happy or about his life with his life .
you go into this capsule , then you float into this dark , hostile environment , where there &apos;s no hope for rescue , if you don &apos;t make it back .
so , from this point of view , you also realize that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only one of these wetlands to be , yes , to the idea of a hundred percent renewable renewable .
it was pricked in the cell , and it realized the other chromosome as a stranger of the material , and so we had a cell just with a new chromosome .
and these scientists have just documented the different subjects with which these ceo is busy , and how much time they spend with making decisions that are related to the topics .
all of you think i was &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have gone somewhere to a handshake on the beach .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and i should do it , because this love story , as romantic as well as romanticizing , is also the final thing .
my first memories are by this boat -- the steal of the motor , the sound of a thumb on the bug , and the empty horizon .
and if you manipulate the speed of this rotating , you &apos;re actually able to put the rotor at the rotor , and eventually , the centrifuge will explode .
it &apos;s the living self , the doctor , the doctor -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt now if i reach you here ? &quot;
now , if we go forward and look for old animals , say 40 years or younger , we see that even the main cause of the main turbulent thing is about the people to care about .
we should call them what it is , an advertisement in absence , a salary , the ecological capital that will enable this production .
we see if we can use storage co2 , which could be brought to just save productivity , convert carbon into the fuel to drive this process .
so when i started talking to companies , and to tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
if people take this seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything on its head , everything we think , for example , in terms of politics and so on .
it depends on a third sentence that doesn &apos;t have to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s the opposite of the first sentence .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the crew of the crew and the design of design -- where we actually started the company -- to get to slowly .
it looks something like this , who has no welcome freedom , can &apos;t be moved for his actions and responsibility to be pulled down to responsibility and therefore he &apos;s unable to do it .
because i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and therefore my palette of music can still have much more color , more color , emotion and emotion than today .
it &apos;s also in such an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , electronics , like electronics , and combines it in quite a biased way .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of deep sea , even in the flat ocean , is as amazing as we can , as we can &apos;t really imagine .
and then the volume of the semantic connection , and the feet that are out of it is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic recovery .
i did a survey recently with over 2,000 american americans , and the average number of decisions that have been a typical americans on a typical day is 70 .
a few weeks later , the firefighters got a letter of the homeowner in which they used to use the tapestry of their household .
the food that was checked by a cheese or a cheesy cooked , has to be eaten , and not just eaten or receptified .
you should be talking about these innovation strategy , and you would have been trained by the ridiculous ones that are being spent on these innovative ways .
and if you want to go over 20 percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn the el off .
and then we went to a d.r.d burning , and we put the bell on the laser and then tried to focus on this camera .
of course , the chance of randomly elected instructions are very small that they &apos;re going to have some sugar , so they &apos;re not going to make any of the instructions that are actually doing this .
that means , instead of remembering individual , we have standardized , extended , used in masses of memories that we can relate to our personal memories .
and yet the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology that you see here is changing everything .
and so i sent them home , i set up a voice in me , trying to tell me , &quot; goldman , don &apos;t do a good idea . &quot;
what do you think about the average performance for a cardiac or a nurse or a orthopedic , a bug , a rescue , a rescue ?
this is a people who don &apos;t cognitive between the colors and green , because the sky &apos;s equivalent of the forest that people depend on , is equal to the equals .
and my love of science fiction appeared in my environment , because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and we explored the deep sea .
we see a lot of gigabytes on digital photos here that you can get closely and get while you &apos;re getting out of your way , returning it in a new way .
this tribe , the cod , have 17 variants on ayahuasca , which they all recognize the distance in the forest that our eyes seem to be a way .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept that the idea of advertising is to present your product as many people as you can see as many people as you can see .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the one that you have in front of each other , because you have a job that you can explain to someone else .
and ultimately , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious to us , at least for those of us who are in the distant places of the earth , to realize that they are not removed at all .
that our system also has a primer on it is because we &apos;re still going to do 20 percent with oil and also a price of price on the other things .
we have only been using phosphorus for two years , and now , through the phosphorus minor mines , we &apos;ve been used much more in the environment than in all the nuclear facilities .
we propose that , in 10 years , the decline of civil rights is going to be as high as the legacy of the legislation of the legislation .
and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s grown up with the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things in common , you just have to build the right systems .
and as far as the isolation goes , if we &apos;re going to be a distant planet , it &apos;s going to be isolated and change the changes of the environment that could produce natural evolution in natural ways .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i think you &apos;re certainly going to have to be a director too , a leader like a shipping apple or something .
and after a very short period of time , it had lost all of the characteristics of species and converted into a completely new species on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
well , i hope that you agree with me that the human resources are human resources that we can use in real life , and that games have a great meaning for change .
now , all of these randomly elected instructions , leading all of the programs and choose buildings , which are the ones i gave . &quot;
these are two very different units , the living self and the memory itself , and the two is part of what &apos;s different from happiness .
if this device has a rarely sequenced or dna virus , which is not known , it &apos;s called the health agency , and it prevents a pandemic in front of its outbreak .
now , if you calculated it , people bought six times more than a glass beard , who they had six choice when they had 24 choices .
but it was a pretty abstract debate , at a point when there was a pause , octavio said , &quot; paul , we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
but for two weeks , we have programmed , we went to the street proton in venice , my kids got involved , my dog , and we created this .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the old greek historian isotus , you may know this story . the story of how and why games have been invented .
but i think in this framework and with the intent to make a disgust into something that i &apos;m just going to leave the needle in there and go from the stage .
and from my view , the scientific method is to look at things , see if it works , if it doesn &apos;t do that , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
a lot of arguments are against fish pollution , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take fish . a big part of them .
and because they &apos;re working much harder than we do , and because they &apos;re only three to six months of life , they &apos;re talking about weight , in their energy consumption , in the energy consumption of something three billion people .
so , if you take the system like me , and you get rid of all the errors of comfort health care , then nobody &apos;s left behind .
i think that the remarkable values of the chose last few years , the last decade is that we are interfered by a physical world to a digital world .
so gender is really complicated ; interacting is not just in the middle of gender -- in a certain sense , you can spread across the whole range .
and by the way , we migrate and circulated , and we miss so much that they can &apos;t tell you that isolation is necessary for evolution , for evolution .
of course , the stories i was looking for were the science fiction : &quot; terminator , &quot; minaliens , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
and in this scenario , they imagine that in a case , the sperm has a chomosom , which hits the x chromosome of the cell .
not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive , and to survive , by the struggle of the human spirit , is determined to transform through conflicts .
and then the middle of the decade after berlin , because i wanted to make renewable energy and did it in kars .
they believed that creativity was a kind of divinity spirit that comes out of a distant , unknown source of people -- from unexplained , unknown reasons .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing marketing spells for people like you and me , if you think about it , doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we don &apos;t buy it .
armstrong was twisted about us and then , in december , the time-magazine magazine was honored as one of the best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because when architects , engineers , as designers , as designers , we always think about how people use things that we design .
they were the notion that people who had the political power were supposed to have this political power because of the bloodline from the grandfather to the son to son and so on .
i have some people who count the number of books that have been published in the last five years , and they spent about 40 , and there were much more .
she came from a man , a african-american , sympau , homeless , homeless , homeless , who played on a violin who had only two more juice .
and i went back to the same torture of shame and self-doubts , i felt fresh and i went to the work until it came back and again .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to be the process of truth and reconciliation .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally who they are , and that &apos;s the profound and weird and strange quantum mechanics .
drouter optimism is the desire to do something immediately , to do a hull with the belief that we have a green hope for success .
now , very briefly , another reason we can &apos;t think of happiness is that we don &apos;t think about the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
suppose you have a blind sensation , and you &apos;re sent to a operaturium , whose average performance has 400 performance in blindness on blindness .
it doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re probably going to go home four hours a bit more likely to go home , but your employer or somebody is going to fall into something like you do with the four hours .
there have never been before in the history of technology development before , this kind of recursive growth , which is a few years old .
and secondly , we as a speary , our environment contain so much that we managed to adapt them to us , and we adapt them to these things .
so the fact is that the white mushrooms doesn &apos;t do as well as the blue pill , which doesn &apos;t do as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was going to see outside the window .
i would tell my father until he finally had a diving school in buffalo , new york , spelled up , just to the other side of the line where we lived .
it could be an owner , wonderful , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and strangeness , outrageous thing that wasn &apos;t quite tom .
and the women came in with their stories about men who didn &apos;t make change , devastating and angry , generated children , caught between two worlds .
in the last month , i had the pleasure , with the quality foundation , called the &quot; $ 10 million comic composition of the x prize . &quot;
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a word that this category really makes something positive , as opposed to &quot; fight and wetness . &quot;
my call to all of you who are flying today is : imagine the same thing happens on your flight -- don &apos;t ask -- but imagine it ; and how would you change ?
for remembering memory , a two-week vacation is barely less than the one-by-wound vacuum , because there &apos;s no new memories to be added .
it was just so that there was self-driven alternatives , and one of them was sitting in the interstate of the mountain , where you adopted the evil .
i &apos;ve now been enough from my quest to know that , yes , the world is expanding , but not the way you fear it .
and there were the rare but painful chiefs of &quot; bad eye , &quot; and there &apos;s mustache : &quot; aside , going home . &quot;
most of you are digital artists , but this is , for example , a scan of congress and it &apos;s in a field of 300 megacities .
we have doubts of the second generation and third generation that are going to be getting out of much higher actors like octan or different kinds of tanaol .
the official dogma is working like this : when our goal is the goal of well-being of our citizens , this is all about the maximizing freedom of the individual .

we actually created six months later a reality that i found myself back in a russian boat , four miles below the surface of the north atlantic , and i looked at the real titanic through an eye .

now , the model is going to be built already in the womb , and it &apos;s cultural , so it works in the world in jung and old , and it &apos;s used by all the time , without the fact that most of us knew that this model is there .
so we &apos;re looking at teams around the world , all these technologies together in a mobile phone so that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s filled with framework , you can test it , you can test your blood or your blood values .
bears that aren &apos;t the worlds for themselves , the operations that are restored , rather than need to build , the driving force , instead of just intensive farmers , who are not just generous , but experts for relationships .
and in this anesthetized one in germany , the egyptian government had sold a couple of programs that they had -- in very large-scale communications of the egyptians .
so these are the three major challenges : criminal groups who do it because of the money , hackers like anonymous , who are resistant to this , but the last group of nations are governments , governments who are running the attacks .
the other hut that i &apos;ve been wearing in my work is the activist , as a patient &apos;s inner lawyer -- or , as i say sometimes as impatient lawyers -- people who are from doctors .
a few years ago , i went to the city that i grew up in , in a food market , a food market in the united states , &quot; red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there in front of a dead tomato .

if you allow someone to be able to activate their own internal forces -- the human mind is so recommend -- if you do , and open someone for a critical moment , then you &apos;re very good for these people .
that means you &apos;ve found that by talking about a common language , you could communicate with each other , you &apos;re in the same cave , in other areas , cities , cities , or villages , and you have that kind of tribal society .

now , if i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of them are government officials . some of the science comes from science , some less , from the economy . here &apos;s my chef . and one comes from music .
i &apos;m studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve just been working on a couple of years now with the biohacking , and i &apos;ve just started because i just wanted to know and do it in front of itself , and i wanted to learn what i &apos;ve learned in studying theoretically .
and i left the medical school with the impression that i knew if i knew everything i knew and knew everything , or at least as much as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as i could do against misses .
and if i go another step further into this intercourse of interfaces , where i agree with speech , language , per pound , and not more mouse and cursor to control things , then i &apos;m going faster and more quickly .
that means , i &apos;ve actually blown them now to realize that they &apos;re not going to recognize more patterns in the middle of it , but i &apos;ve got them in a short time , again , back in this dog , to see the picture .
because right now , where i &apos;m going to turn my hand away from you , so you can see from the back , this finger moving here , my finger , just from where it was in a position where it was in a position that it &apos;s so stretched out .
not to burn the elevator , but to burn a little better , and to put it on it and to try to lose it into the fuel facility for materials , but first to question how do you make a difference ?
the first thing i saw was that this idea was that their brand personality separated two , but it happened to be disseminated pages -- the morgan lodges is a remarkable march .
in other services , like the use of fertilizers , 105 : 55 : 55 : &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; 55 : 55 : 5852 or air traffic traffic , the space is much smaller for much smaller improvements .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is , if i zoom in on things , then i can get them confused by how confusing the right side of the right side , where i don &apos;t know what salz is and puppets , or i can sort of make it more intuitive by showing things .
because this is what it turns out : if you offer a placebo in a white mushroom , in a form of aspiring , it &apos;s just a predator , white ball , that has a particular measurable effect .
the coal evolution of industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid outcome in the case of the zones , and so we have cooler refrigerators , climate , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
we switched the light off , we put it in a vacuum and clean air and cooled it up until now , just to the end of the day , the metal was free to behave as it always wanted .

and dr. kean said he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they don &apos;t get anything else , and even if they get a little bit of support , if you get kids to overcome themselves , they can get a lot of kids . &quot;
when we get to these really big gaps -- with over 100,000 base pairs -- these are not going to be easy in e. coli . it &apos;s rising all the possibilities of modern molecular biology . and so we turn us into other mechanisms .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a outsider , a new head , new in the picture -- and not just okay , but something you have to be worthy , maybe a gift of the boat .
and so i think of the city of the city as a very different way of looking at another impression , which i see negative and positive zones of a city and so on this kind of way , a different virtual map of a very real city .
but this is the most part of what can happen , because this is the forced group , forced to help patients , because it could be used against obesity , or it could be patients that could make noise .

and because i was born without a washing legs , and my feet had moved to court , and i had just got a few toes , and a few toes on the other foot , he was the overwhelmed , this strangers had to get the bad news .

if we &apos;re in a game world , i think many of us are turning into our best version , anytime and are ready to solve , hard to try to solve the problem , as long as it takes to try and avoid the error .
and since i &apos;m just giving one of these little devices , because things are supposed to be more intuitive , more and more natural , natural use friendly , you have to look at what is actually human beings , which is , of course , what &apos;s friendly or intuitive .
do you have no fear that you live in this piece of life and you never get out of it , and you &apos;re not going to die on a rotbrush dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter of the woods ?

they raised these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face , or see the figure , nothing , and conclusion that this was the devil maps of the rock , and the five killed with the spears of the spears .
i &apos;ve always been writing my synonym dictator , but i &apos;ve been working with the texture , and i &apos;ve come to me that i &apos;ve never been in my life , which is the word &quot; disability . &quot;
imagination is more powerful , and with this sentence , i &apos;d like to close to the clues and to give the clues , designers also have to think differently to come up with new solutions , and in this sense , thank you very much for your heart and please .
and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to download this dark path of the assumptions -- especially in which i was in my career .
the older black man stood up . he saw the deputy , and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come here to say this young man , they don &apos;t lose the target from the eyes . they don &apos;t look at it . &quot;
so , the problem of cooperative online worlds like the world &apos;s warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying , currently on the edge of an episode , that we prefer our whole time in these worlds .
later , i was driving on this site with miguel , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be so natural , &quot; as any farm ever since i ever had ever been , &quot; how do you succeed ? &quot;
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice caps , for three million years , the size of the lower 48 states , had shrunk by 40 percent .

both of my profession in robin and in my side , when i was a volunteer , i &apos;m a witnessing man of generosity and friendship in the big scale , but i also see the closest of love and the mud of individual .
suppose you live in a certain remote area , and you &apos;ve got a beloved of people with heart disease and your homegrown physicists to overcome this dedicate cardiac , whose average performance is 200 .
but when i did with him , and i asked him why he made this intervention -- it was very risky operations -- his answer was that in his country , these kids would be treated very bad , and so he had to do it .
and of course , when it &apos;s also intuitive , and how can i take as an age of influence and make things so that they &apos;re so designed to use a user , so they &apos;re intuitive , because then they &apos;re fun , and they &apos;re just too easy to use .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes , and those who do not do the ones , the ones who constraints and the limits without the limitations that are doing bad outcomes and good outcomes .
it also has three big problems . the cost of everything that are highly regulated countries , and the question is that you really feel that you can &apos;t get out of anything , despite the human labor , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work because we &apos;re afraid of being a real gas , and it keeps millions of people from bloom .
now , having to decide not to buy a glass of marrow is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our prevalence -- but it turns out that the decision-making process is also affecting us with very convenient decisions .
i don &apos;t have to admit this emotionally , because at the same time it &apos;s going to be a different , colorful , colorful , outcome , outfit , just waiting for me if i have a little bit of heart in the heart and search of it .
so that &apos;s one effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end up with less satisfaction than if we had the opportunity to choose between less choices .
here &apos;s a picture that i took on the north of the baffin islands when i went to inuation on the whirlwind , and this man , olaolya told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the memory of self , and you can think of the memory itself as one , which is kind of a living thing itself through experiences that don &apos;t need to be alive .
i mean , when i get up alone , i do all sorts of weird things , but then i get to other people , and i listen to all of these things because i don &apos;t want them to do it , or frankly , say , break it away .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to make more striking and less , but in average , that number is going to increase every year , and so more than doubling , the number of services that are enriched by the person .
i met these people of grass , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on any given surface , and then draw with a laser pointer on it , which is only the negative .
so , what that means when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place of humans in evolution , and especially as we look at the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a set of possibilities .
so there &apos;s big challenges here . there &apos;s challenges in transmission . for example , if we say the power is outside the country , they don &apos;t just need to deal with the technology , they also have to deal with the risk of where the energy comes from .
but , as we think , the only way we think about biology , without any greater impact on food costs , or restriction of its availability , is when we see co2 as co2 , and therefore we work on the way .
i began to work through scientific literature , about how these centrifurifuge are built in nates and found that they are structured in so-called kacascade , and each askative killed 164 .
now , the fascinating thing is that the beetles &apos; tailine , which are in the liane , mao-inhibitors of exactly the kind that are necessary to question the trunks of tamdine . so they ask themselves .
this is a problem , because the global warming reason is given to the arctic ocean , where there are huge amounts of frozen carbon in which when it comes to microbes from methane .
and what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of attacks was , in fact , it was slowly possible , to make it happen , obviously -- in the attempt to be desperately desperately desperately desperately desperate so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get behind them .
so maybe german empowering this technological change , because the fact that there was always a different truth , which is that every human being can give a very special society and very powerful force , and that the human capacity to adapt to our biggest skill .
my good friend ray shortly because we &apos;ve shown that every tool that will be used to the information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and the price of price performance has been doubling all over 24 months .
the first project that we did as international group , as we sort of consciously became aware of ourselves , o.k , now we &apos;re a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people who are there and so on .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say to your parents that you never walk , and never be as rich as other children , or that you could never have ever lead an independent life , and since they just punish me . &quot;
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head , instead of going from one to another , go from lots of things to many things to many things , and see the patterns that otherwise would be otherwise bored ?
that means we feel so guilty about the earth , that we say , there &apos;s no bio-landing , no bioluminescent , no harm proliferce , and how they all allow them to allow us to go back our own exposes .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i found something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in individual organisms , divide each cell , and all of the genetic information in both deaths is carried on in both dead cells .
that was worth me for all this year in the clean space , because , if you look at it , the massless difference between one and one piece of metal , the metal piece of metal is about the same as the difference between the metal and all of them .
and i &apos;ve gotten it all the way up to six sixth grade , and then we got together with friends , i &apos;ve become the founder of solon solar fires , which then comes together with the spin of a major cellular manufacturer in the world .
at the time , it was just a monkey , where skulls , claws and others have said , you &apos;re really insane when people start reading the people , then they want to talk about the afterwards and that &apos;s completely fatal .
if a plate in spain is something unpossible , something magical has done : allah , ol√© , ol√© , olallah , allah , great , brown fiber optic , there &apos;s a glimpse of god .
so , what &apos;s happening in &quot; the science of the won outside , &quot; is that everything from the top down to the bottom up , to the end , is completely out of the brands -- the sponsor you &apos;re going to see in the movie , this is the marx .
and the message is now , we need to be on these rotating animals , if we kind of include our goals , 20 percent , 20 percent , forced , 20 , 30 , three percent , and so on , if we want to reach the first .
you then have given over a three-month dream of a &quot; rig , &quot; which was a very good note . &quot; it was told to be you that you were very clever , and after these three months , you really wrote down .
and what i &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is made from normal letters that we use to symbolic -- and i &apos;ve written my business card on a piece of dna , and it &apos;s 10 times amplified .
and i wonder today , how much his vision of me as a strong , powerful and powerful girl has shaped my self-assembled image , and i could imagine myself as a one of nature from powerful , powerful and lethal man .
and they &apos;re also called by my general doctor , so that he can see where my weight is , and not only in the moment that i need cardiac support or so , but with a look in the past .

it &apos;s a picture of the first punchline of particles that reject all the way around the hc , then put a part of the lhc on the lhc to make a rain basket on the detector .
he got 400,000 of his people around because he felt that red beekeepers , bone and shake oil are much more effective as an antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can move from aids .
and finally , i think , though it &apos;s so dramatic , beautiful and inspiring , and so inspiring , we will not be measured to our technology , not to the things we develop , not from our intellect and our minds .
instead , what i do , and what the designers do is we think , we think , at a certain abstract translation , we give this machine to the machine , and the machine does something that &apos;s going to overcome our skill skill , and better than we could ever do .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 shops in the world , with students , developers and architects , even with ctos &apos;s company , and there &apos;s something about this task that allows deep insight into nature , and i &apos;d like to share some of them with them .
and you can see that if you think of our seven senses , most of us think we only have five , right now , there are even seven , certainly in the future , we &apos;re still going to have a sense of the next , and as an extension of our self .

this selective event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography named biography , pray love , pray love , which , when all my previous books came out of any reason in the world , and a great mega-event , international event , was polarized .
a continent is always going to be exposed , because the assumption was that there was no religious faith in sub-saharan africa , and of course there was a voodoo doo , which is just a very profound religious thought , while the tragedy of the tragedies of slavery .
but in fact , in truth , we &apos;re seeing more and more and more , if you &apos;re willing to engage , and the unimportant opportunities are going to be unrelated , well , then there &apos;s a increase in salary of numbers , there will be the cost of cost , the cost of r &amp; amp ; d , and there &apos;s an improvement of decision-making .
and one day , he looked at me at one of my practices -- these were just fatigue and gnadens -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so powerful , powerful and virgin , you &apos;re going to be a young girl one day of those warfare .
and the wind and the sun and the load and the load load and came to the conclusion , a very exciting result of the conventional system , where you end up with the conventional system , after 20 years , you get a bent of about five cents a kilowatt-hour , you need to get out of four cents .
and the problem is not just a technological problem , it can be a social problem , it can be a simple problem , but it can be a real problem , which is how easy things do , a simple problem of trying to solve , a question , and how you can do it differently , or how you can do it .
feeding crop crops at plant food , skull fat-fat-fatal drugs , on the earth , on the chicken , on fish , and the whole time the agricultural industry asked the agricultural industry , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can it be ? &quot;
not through the latest hunting resonates , and tractor-inventions , but through fertilized land , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not through fresh water , not through fresh water , but through forests , through forests and not through fishing and boats , but through the sea .
so this is one that has more artistic directions , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and philosophers and collaboration with scientists to get involved with these technologies and ask them to process , and to process the creative , because there &apos;s a lot of leadership out there , and there &apos;s all sorts of things to do .
they &apos;re putting the amount of carbon that goes into temperature , which leads to temperature , and has increased some very negative consequences . effects on the weather , and perhaps worse , indirectly , that the natural ecosystems that can &apos;t adapt the ecosystems of these very rapidly advertently and systems .
selective attributes are things that are tempted to play , like the prince , congestified , adventurous , disgusting , and love like elessness , and agile , and agile , acceptance , magical , magical , and mystically and magical as alert .
in other words , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran up and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t do the house and she liked the poem through her , and she passes it . she said it would continue to pull on land -- and as she said -- and as she said , &quot; look for another judge . &quot;
maybe this is a moderate contribution , and if you were better than i expected , but my core say here is that we have to work on all five people , and we can &apos;t give you any of them because they &apos;ve been paying us all the problems of significant problems .
and where you can see how far we are from what we really wanted to do and how sad we are , and how sad we are at all on earth , you can see that , for example , that openly , there &apos;s a program going to be four to 20 client here , right ?
in my 2020 years of thinking of medical consciousness , journalism and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal study of medical error and wrong treatments to create everything for one of my first articles that i wrote for the toronto of my &quot; white show , &quot; which is to learn how to learn . &quot;
so with total transparency , what the new thinking is , what the old thinking is , don &apos;t tell you that , in the laser horse , it &apos;s not a meat of meat , and it &apos;s not a beef or anything else that i want to do right now , and that &apos;s what i want to do .
now , not exactly what i was hoping for , but i went off -- the stairs , the fluid , the title , along the &quot; real firemen , &quot; the firemen are over to that point at that point with that point were pretty much finished in the room to get a pair of shoes .
i had to redesign a little bit of an infinite number of times with these thick beds -- in different colors -- you know it to build my muscles . and i hated it more than anything else i hated it . i hated it . i fed it up . i hated it . i hated it .
but we wanted to go even further . we wanted to build a total bacterial chromosome . it has more than 50,000 genetic code , so we thought we could build it in the size of the virus of the virus that we could figure out the size of the size of the individual , which is a living component of a living cell .
and from a conversation with dekaman , one of the innovators of the do , i want to share with you a little bit -- he gave me the permission -- his technique , the slingers , &quot; and many of you may have heard of . it &apos;s the size of a student at the time .
&quot; cloud documents , &quot; something that my friends call &quot; autodesk , &quot; presents , sensors and networks , networks , 3d printers that allow personal production to democratize the personal production of our planet , democracies , synthetic biology , vaccinations , food and food , digital materials , artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence .
look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo galaco &apos;s state , the light bulb doesn &apos;t burn any comprehensive , an astonishing conclusion of the mind of the mind can affect the body so that it holds out that when it comes in an extreme condition .
this was the most surreal form of a √©ju carvu , which i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i go to a corner corner , i always knew what was going to happen in the light of the vehicle , because i was walking around the film , when we were filling the film .
in this picture , i &apos;ve taken a busy as a center of despair in all directions , because if you look at the changing tree of life , all of the existing specialians have lived in the second evolutionary terms of evolutionary success , they have survived it ; it has transformed the environment and demonstrated by the strength of life .
and the premise with this premise with this premise , for example , brian degger in england has tried to summarize a minimum , and then a steam coop-ed coat , and a hot plate , and that &apos;s what cap winners are doing , and then bacteria can grow .
and then it came from the do-it-yourself bio gorg website , and said o.k , we need to meet now , real , real time , and then has two events in london , a second , a thousand , 10 thousand , and just in the u.s.c , san francisco .
this equation has four factors . a little bit multiplied . you have this thing -- co2 , you want to get zero , and this will depend on the number of people , depending on the service that each person is using average , the average energy that you &apos;re using in the average energy for every solar energy and co2 per unit per unit .
and the realization of president lobo was that , in fact , the certainty of the wisdom that i thought about was as a way of getting the foreign investors to come up and build this city , could be meaningful for all of honored honorts in honduras for the many years , that i &apos;ve been suffering and sufficient in fear and suffering .
i read this list of a friend according to my friend , and i had to laugh it so ridiculous , but i just got to say , &quot; courts , &quot; and i couldn &apos;t talk anymore , and i had to stop reading , and i first refused to get over that confluctuation , and so that we can &apos;t get the fake shot .
a group of ankings from ara , which i &apos;ve been learning a while ago , which is a student , a student , who wanted to convey more to the public , which she wanted to learn to learn in college , and they &apos;ve tried to explain the street in the street , and try to explain to people what it is .
there &apos;s 175 rescue in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 different olive crystals and 12 balicony that you could buy to make a large number of dessalt dishes in which you don &apos;t have any chance that the 175 store is right for you .
and this was really , really , really , really , really , really , very bitter , and then you get into the phase of this , which is what i &apos;ve been thinking about , where i &apos;ve been asking myself , for 10 years , a thousand years , which was still , basic , soundloving , of course , of course , if that &apos;s supposed to be so great .
first of all , what i &apos;m going to show you , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology , a new technology that we have as part of an exaggeration , a year ago . this is seadragon . and it &apos;s a environment where you can either be able to be able to get a huge amount of visual data from visual data .
the first thing you get when you get big as a child , as a baby , is that you &apos;re going to take care of what you &apos;re going to have , right ? and so depending on whether your parents allowed you to play more or less in your boxes and more , the more , the more you , the more , the curiosity is going to be , of course , your curiosity .
i mean , the most eyewitnings of our life -- and i &apos;ve chosen that -- you know , psychological than about three seconds long . what it means is that there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a month . there &apos;s about one month , there &apos;s about 600,000 . most of them don &apos;t leave behind .
bill gates , bill gates : to run the simulation on a supercomputer , get all the big scientists , what we did , we just need some 10 million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s reasonable , it &apos;s only in the order of 100,000 million people .
now , this really works , this is what &apos;s done in academia , and then we thought , o.o. , which we may have , we &apos;ve taken a webcam , then we cut the webcam , put the noise in the lens , then you have a microscope , you have a microscope that &apos;s going to take hundreds of thousands of times .
if i show you 600 magazines and show them in 10 categories , or i &apos;ll show you 400 times , and those in 20 categories , you believe that i &apos;ve given you more choices and more choice and better experience than 400 of them that i would have given you when i gave you the 400 to you , if i gave you the 600 .
friday &apos;s &apos;s friday , friday &apos;s friday . god frita fried on friday . let &apos;s say , &quot; let &apos;s take the kit down . friday . friday friday . frightenon friday . don &apos;t think you &apos;d be thinking that we were going to do this conversation without talking about this video . i hope . i hope i &apos;m frightening .
i think i think a significant channel -- not the only , but a significant contributor to the explosion of this depression , and also suicide is that people have experienced the disappointment because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain that experience themselves , they have to be more likely to think of their fault .
and the neolithic revolution that brought us agriculture , which brought us to agriculture , and at this moment in the moment of the saatrical corn , the poetry of the pamie through the propink of the pink and greek hierarchy and hierarchy , and this is just about 10,000 years ago .
this is when you focus a laser on a room , and then you can catch little particles in the air , or in the liquid air , and then you move into the liquid , and then you get into that focus , so the one that &apos;s kind of like a trajectory in a penctory .
it would be great if we could put this paradigm into a different kind of strength or strength to even form a little dangerous , audacious , so we could take the forces of very many children , and invite them to get their special skills , and bring them in a very special and valuable way into society .
you know , when michelangelo formed the moangely , it means he took the end of the hammer , and he was waiting for him -- you can still see a little bit of a little drunk under it -- and said , &quot; pervin , pernaroon ? why don &apos;t you spine ? &quot;
but today , when you &apos;re in 2011 , you &apos;re buying a new color printer of the leading laser prescription , and you &apos;re going to print a page , you &apos;re going to have this bright side , you &apos;re going to print on every side , you &apos;re going to see the pattern in a clearly that &apos;s going to make it look clear on its back and your backwards .
and my colleague at mit , assagf , you could take a lot more about this , and the other wonderful things that you can tell , but i &apos;d like to talk to you about the second part that we talked about , and this is the beginning of our environment .
now , the problem , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have the sympathy for the difficult circumstances , when they look at orderly and colorful and colorful , but they kind of look at the past , during the past , while real-world , our world .
and then i did this in my lab , i tried to do a little bit in my lab , and then i got a little bit like this , and then i bought my hand axes on eve bay , and a little bit of n.a analysis , trying to make a decision , so this is how / n.print prina printed to do .
and if you choose a different vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species and you have to think about how you decide this conflict , and that &apos;s not really obvious , because if you think about it at the time , if you get an answer , and if you think about it , if you could get a response in your mind , you could get another answer .
in the early 800s , i got a really astonishing task when my professor at harvard asked if i was interested in going to go to haiti and filming the societies that were filling out of the foundation of duvaliton and couton and couton were used to make it safe .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people are always asking me to talk about how i &apos;m going to deal with widespread and i &apos;m going to tell you something : this phrase for me , and i &apos;ve always been very uncomfortable with asking people to answer the questions of people , and i think that &apos;s why i understand why .
and if i &apos;m now translating this , for example , in which i &apos;m translating as an overwhelmed , selective choice as a selection , in which all of them will come up to me , i can look at myself in the detail , and , yes , i mean , i can throw it somewhere else or buy somebody else and buy it .
i recommend all of you to read steves , or look at the film , so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful interconnectedness of these two men who have happened to us , but also how the music helped the music and how it was when this instrument was allowed to allow the game to get away from the street .
down here in the picture , you can see the lab , in anxiety , which is such a garage , with all kinds of laboratories , which has wiped out a group of paris in paris , which is quite successful , and is also quite interesting , because i want to cut a project .
not a biologist would say , for example , to say that 50 percent of all species are dying in front of all species , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the apocalyptizing of arithmetic in the field of biological diversity -- is barely the biodiversity that is not known as the most optimistic scenarium on the planet .
bg : well , we haven &apos;t yet set ourselves up a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting public policy rules for everything that &apos;s called a nuclear name . there are big interest and the people of the company in russia were in russia , india , india , i &apos;ve been here , and there &apos;s a lot of the empire power and talked about how this is going to be owned .
the computer visions have given these pictures together so they put the real space in which these records , all around the grasslands in the grasslands were made in the canadian rockports of rockets , and you can see elements of stabilized or pan-pandemic , and these things have been put together into all the relationship with each other .
and if you look at the kind of software that we &apos;ve just seen before , then you &apos;ll understand why nevague unities of our software are not much intuitive , or not based on usb , the ipad in lots of imaging , or even more classical , even though it &apos;s more classical than software .
and the result is -- we call it &quot; patients &quot; autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift of responsibility is a shift for the responsibility of someone who knows something -- namely the name of somebody -- who &apos;s a doctor knows nothing better -- and probably not in fact , the best decision is a constant choice -- is to make a difference .
this idea was to me when i was in the middle of the process of writing , pray love , love . i fell in this grueling of the doubt that we all fall when we &apos;re working on something , and it doesn &apos;t work . you start thinking that it &apos;s going to be a disaster . the worst that was ever written .
we also have one of those same gagles in the same size , as he stands up there , in the hall to actually see the full dynamic of this web , so in the halfway out there is now the backside , there &apos;s a large battery standing here , there &apos;s the big battery that &apos;s all over here that we can simulate the web .
they believed that a genie was this kind of magical divine credited by the thought it was literally going to work in the dancing of an artist -- sort of like the dobby , who came out of the household , and who was the artist who was invisible to work at some level , and would make the work invisible .
now , if i want to give you one thing today , it &apos;s that the total data that we consume is bigger than the sum of their pieces , and instead of thinking about information , i &apos;d like you to think about how we can use information , and so that we &apos;re going to see patterns that , and we &apos;re not going to have become the most visible .
so , we &apos;ve done a study that i did with shlomo benari and alessandro d terrtero , we &apos;ve done a study with the people -- employees that all worked for -- and these were all collected in a gathering collection in which they put together in their participation for their money .
the interesting historic footnote : when the mosquito south spain brought it to this use . the language changed over the centuries of allah , lah allah , lah allah to an allah , olol√© , which you &apos;re still fighting to fight with sticks and flyer .
now , these days , you need to be able to get a race , in fact , something like this -- something that &apos;s done in real time , some thousand sensors that have made information out of the car that gives this information to the system , and then you &apos;re going to use this car and then you &apos;re going to send these decisions back to this car and send things back to real time in information .
i was scared , not because of my fear , but i was afraid that i could lose him to speak in his circumstances , and that i could destroy his relationship to the violin , if i started to destroy about tons and peargiarson and other exciting forms of dagodder .
so , in fact , the fact is that you remember the 20th century , in 300 years , not for its wars or technological innovation , but rather than a gardena , where we were against the destruction and the massive destruction of the biodiversity and cultural diversity in either the earth or the active ingredients , or the problem . so this is not the change .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which was the census of things in visual effects and computer generalized effects in a whole new way , with realistic human expression , expressive characters that had been made in middle , and the characters were all supposed to be cg . and the world should be cg . and the cg should be cg .
i &apos;m probably listening to these two neanderthals , because i &apos;m probably listening to the generation , which has chosen to this bad image , because i &apos;ve already launched hundreds of thousands of semi-neanderthals already to study in carrots , technical school , so that i think it &apos;s a high school today , i think you &apos;re using kit .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a fragile answering for one of my lectures , who was a story . &#91; unclear &#93; ... he said he would have heard a fist , and it was absolutely gorgeous music , and at the end of the day , there was a terrible noise of the sound .
do you know ? i think one person will allow him to think that he thinks , or he &apos;s like the vessels , and the essence and the source and the source of all , creative , unknown , unknown , mysterious mysterious , is a little bit too much responsibility to help you get a human mind , human mind .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time co2 , then the skeptics say , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t make me feel that it &apos;s not a co2 that i wish that it &apos;s almost nasty , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s a cheap method , because it &apos;s more cheap . &quot;
it &apos;s actually this thing that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who said , we have two reflections of two different surgeons in different surgeons , and it &apos;s supposed to choose , then the one who has chosen , the memory that has the memory , which is less bad , and this is the surgeon that &apos;s chosen will be chosen .
you know , all of you know the healthy schedules , if you give a secret to the best , even though this one is swallowed on a swing , and then you get the best friend and the best friend confronts with this , and a terrible discussion , when you end up with a bad thing , and you get the bad thing , and you realize that you never make a mistake again .
you know , you know , one of the great reasons when you &apos;re traveling , and a freudian &apos;s freudian research is together with people who can still remember the old days . the past is still in the past , when they feel their wind , they &apos;re only in the glue , they &apos;re touched to the bitter , they &apos;re in the bitter of the plants .
if you ever have the chance to have an opportunity to work in your urban center , like our scott silman , as part of the program -- in fact , you will do it -- you will see all of the -- that you will see the people who are calling for many different problems because of the problems , including adventure , that there is a bad house in your house .
in fact , the beautiful thing is , if you do that , agriculture , biogas , on a hectare with five thousand housing in favelas , so that he can wait for about a hundred dollars a year , and they will wait for the cup , they will grab a cup and they will grab a pig and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables .
we are at the threshold of amazing events , amazing events in many places , and yet i really think we need to go back 300 years before the enlightenment to find a time when we &apos;ve been fighting progress in the progress that we &apos;ve talked about these things , more than we &apos;ve done more than we &apos;re doing now .
so by just playing color , confucking and helpful to change the images of individual photography , photographers , photographers , like deep , deep deep deep , distinguishable and color , we get the boundaries between different images and how they look like a single picture , even though hundreds of levels can reveal hundreds of levels .
and if i were to go into a space with colleagues and ask her soundscape , and tell them what i just told you , i would probably not reach the end story of the second story before it would be uncomfortable with you , somebody would have a soundscape , and they would forget the rest , and i would forget the rest .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good at all , you &apos;re going to take your listen to your personal communication device -- i &apos;m going to give you the permission -- and you might be able to look at a set of cap &apos;s book , which is not because nothing is going to be wrong in this talk is going to make any sense for you .
a couple of years ago , the laser price of scientist shinyamanan took his research in which he took a sculpture , a broader bladder , and through the manipulation of only four genes that they lead to a pluripotent stem cell -- a potential cell in the potentially of the body is able to become a body .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve made all of the kinds of batteries that are made : the cars , the cars , computers , cell phones , pops , pops , everything . and i &apos;ve been using a lot of the electronic energy that uses the world , i find out that all the batteries , that we can now produce less than 10 minutes ago .
now , let &apos;s take a step back in the time of the big bang 14 years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of creatures , maybe three to four billion years ago , on earth -- the first polar organisms , maybe 800 organisms , maybe much more than 800 or 800 years ago -- and then the human species , which then is in 130,000 years .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedrals of cathedral , who , at the end of the computer with flickr , and they just give an emergentire in flickr , and they &apos;re going to preserve pictures of men in t-shirts and in the university of the university education . every one of these farbelongs is a model that was discovered as a model that was detected to this model .
and yet , in this country , here in the country , in the united states , we are building people -- this is risk to death , to become higher , if the victims , it &apos;s victims , when it &apos;s black . when the six times higher , when the defeat is white , and the victims are white in the same states -- in the same cases where people are saviating in their bodies .
once i was traveling with a young colleagues 6,000 miles from china to west country , and i was only hated to ltia , and when i was hated to la , i saw the face behind the statistics from which you hear 6,000 sacred mons that were transformed in and turned 1.2 million people who were killed during the cultural revolution .
and so the idea is , now , if you &apos;ve got all kinds of problems in something that you &apos;ve only got about what you &apos;ve got later -- and the investment is not so clear . in fact , the ipcc is not necessarily the worst possible thing , and there are people in the rich world who look at ipcc and look at cpc and say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not a big deal . &quot;
we cleaned up the chromosome of a microbial species , and these two are as far apart from each other and mice . we gave some extra genes to this chromosome , we could choose this chromosome . we could disrupt it with enzymes of enzymes to destroy all the proteins , and it was very amazing when we put it in a cell -- and we &apos;re going to estimate our very strong -- here .
margaret mead , the great anthropologist before she died that her greatest fear is that while we &apos;re moving towards a thread , uneless , generic view , we &apos;re not only going to move the whole range of human imagination into a mindset , but that we were going to come out of a dream one day , and have ever forgotten for sure that there were other possibilities .
i &apos;d like to just show you one of the original database of noah , and this is from a early prototype of photosynth that we &apos;ve been working on in the first summer to show you what i think it really is the pointment of this technology , that &apos;s photosynthetic technology , and this is not necessarily the fact that you &apos;re looking at the environments that we &apos;re looking at .
in some ways , with other words , sugar pills have shown in some studies , a measurable effect , the placebo effect , and that &apos;s because the person thinks they &apos;re thinking about what is their pharmaceutical , a pharmaceutical pharmaceutical sort of ... for example , for example , if there are only a patient who believes in the body , in the body that you call the placement of the body .
when one of them said no , this was the vopzip , which has been a completely fragmented . i &apos;ve spent 10 years looking for the second whether i &apos;m studying my great engineering engineer to really make a waking of a wax thing , because all my father has performed to him for a living , you &apos;ve given me the money to come out for a living .
i had recently encountered such an encounter when i met the extraordinary american conduction in ruth stone , which is now about 90 , but the whole life of her life was in divine . she told me that when she grew up in the villages of virginia , and she said she was able to listen to the field , and she said she could feel like a poem about the poem on her land .
it means that a small child from the anger that is growing up in the believe that the mountain is a puppet , or her destiny , or her destiny will determine a different person , and a different relationship to this rescue or this resource , as a little montana child growing up in the montana , that a pile is a bunch of stones .
usually my role is to explain to people like wonderfully the new technologies that are coming up to be , and i thought i &apos;d be under my friends here , i &apos;d tell you what i &apos;m really thinking . and also trying to figure out what &apos;s going on here , and what &apos;s really going on with these amazing technologies , what &apos;s going on in the front of us is that we can hardly be able to harmless .
and that would be the answer to the bloodshed argument that if you used all this time and use the energy to solve all the co2 , all the other goals , including the poverty reduction , the reducing of malaria , the fighting of malaria , and so on , it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources to invest in while there are things that we can do better things .
now , these people have come online to me , but they &apos;ve been picking out what they &apos;ve used to do by using drowning janers to pay money out of our bank accounts while we &apos;re doing our online banking , or the keyboard , the loans , the diet-based information that we &apos;ve collected over the keyboard while , while we &apos;re buying about a computer online course .
again , lady parks came back to montgomers , where they had two of their oldest friends . this elderly women , johnjohn carr , who had the mongomernity boykin boott -- an incredible american american -- and virginia , a , white , white , whose white man , clifferland , clifferr cliffy , dr. king .
and so the ones that have set up there are two bathers and said , o.k , we do it easier and cheaper , and then we have open source , so we have open source , open source , hardware , electronics , electronics , this device that have now gone up to market , and now these are actually the market , and that are now the checkers of the cheap performance in the world .
and that made me feel like i was a different person than my friends , under kwaul , who believe that this is the forests of the hubris of hukuwait and the hipelbodious tickel and the cannicanal , the nightmarks of the world , the norwegian world that they were going to engage in their sadness .
a week ago , verbs from the national academy of wire to the wire of francis for francis nold and wilold , two scientists who developed independent scientists were working independently to lead the natural process to go faster and lead to a soundscape in a way -- which is , in a franccolonial evolution . &quot; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and now i want to leave you with biology as well as biology , and since i want to use this metaphor , which comes from synthetic biology , biology is that biology is actually a science of information , because the code is a code of abstract code , yes , it &apos;s not exactly like computers , because it &apos;s just because it &apos;s matter , it &apos;s matter , because it &apos;s matter , because it &apos;s matter , and it &apos;s real , and it &apos;s real .
now , bruce bruce brown , a famous design researcher at the brighteo university , so far as to say that this mass media , he meant the book and the image , so not the television , the internet , and so on , and so on , what we call mass media data today is that these mass media shows that our mass media and our media may have embedded .
now , some people really , really , really , really , some happy people and companies , for-profit profits , had the opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris will never let go back to -- namely , the right items to buy the rights in which they &apos;re looking at , just at the title that wasn &apos;t having a lot of content on it , and there &apos;s not a lot of content , and there &apos;s not a lot of point of what it would be .
it &apos;s a set of the phrase that we &apos;re living with vienity from the idea that success or happiness depends on being a challenge , without becoming the experience of imperative experience . as if my life were successful as if my life were ever going to successfully because i could fall to the possible lives of a proogiate with a prosthetic life , or whatever , i could think , as people with me .
and when these people came and looked at these people and saw who was the best protein in the world , this was not a professor , including caltech , somebody from england , somebody from the manchester , a chester woman , who worked on assistant to business as a business health clinic , worked at the best , and the best protein proteins in the world was the world at night .
of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. p. so , i &apos;m doing the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with , with the vision that 50 years of girls are going to be in the second place , but he actually taught me to get my usual commitment to seeing this , which is how much of a new story , and a new experience of the experience .
in the past year i &apos;ve been looking for model models for model , to do this , i &apos;ve also tried to find myself in the past , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they &apos;ve had better or more reasonable ideas about how to help us deal with creative risks , with the risks that are connected to creativity .
so we have this situation , so we &apos;ve got a situation where our science continued to go , we need to be more and more so that these categories that we thought we &apos;d had stable anatomic categories that had very simple configurations to create an identity of identical identity , much more sophisticated vements than we thought we were .
so i went home to my wife at night and i went home to my wife and i was telling her all about , and we thought , &quot; well , wait a second , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to control things , then we should find a way to get a chance that he can do so that he can take away from that , he can do that again , he can do that . &quot;
and so there are different ways , but the beautiful thing is that a molecule has a million energy as much as we say , a coal , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , and that is mostly the footprint , and the cost of the cost , the cost of the cost is vital , the potential , the effect , the effect , the effect , the effect , the effect , the effect , the effect on the country , and the other things in your own .
from the medical standpoint of view , of course , you can say that my legs , the laser surgery for visualization , conjunction of titan and artificial hip , for aging people , allow people to really enjoy their possibilities , and the boundaries of their natural fate to develop their natural forces , are not to speak from social networking , to people , to define their own identity , to look at their own way in the world , to look at them .

i &apos;m going to leave you with a words of english scientists . hummingy daphy , the way i suspect , as he defers to his experiments , his teacher , his michael farsol , who said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for human development , as our scientific ideas , that we &apos;re not contentious , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our new world is a whole new thing , and there are no new worlds of it . &quot;
and we &apos;re entering a series of companies that travel in the nosphere of ethnicity that we &apos;re taking our audience from such places such as cultural imperative of the laws , that they &apos;re assigned by the laws of the globe , and hopefully they &apos;re going to embrace one after another in the other , the central anthropology of anthropology : that this world has earth-made that there are many different ways that we can actually find a way in a more lives in our cultural lives that can find the world where people can be more commons .
and one of them is because of them , by definition , the great choice of various sales of respiratory resign , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and which , which is salatter ressing ? it &apos;s perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that they could have made a different decision to make the decision better . and what happened is that this is that they made the decision about the decision , and that this advisor that they made it , that they made it a decision .
at the end of this amazing initiation , they will suddenly take one day and for the first time in their life , from 18 years , they will see a sunset . and in this crystal moment of consciousness , the first time of consciousness , when the sun begins to turn out to the amazing landscape , suddenly everything they learned from abstract things in the abstract value . and he says , &quot; you know , it &apos;s really what &apos;s happening ? &quot;
i found really extraordinary , i found that he had collected all of my childhood childhood , whether i had won a letter competition in the second class , whether i had a medical school class , whether i was with the scripts at parking too much , whether i was a scholarship , whether i was a penalty or my pencil of sports , and i had these students using his medical students to come out of the medical school .
if you have a person , and when you have people , the fastest belief is that they have a soul , or you can say , they believe that from sediment to life , then the sought that would be so precise , as if the soul is so vivid as a soul , they &apos;re not just made out of matter , not just from meat , and they &apos;re kind of flourishing , sort of flourishing , kind of flourishing , the soil , the inferry , it , it &apos;s unprecious .
inspired by the way of our interaction with real objects -- with my berry patti patents and my colleague and my fellow jean calcium , i started to wonder : what if we were to use computer , instead of a currency , like a rule on the top floor , what if we were to move on the surface , if we could attack it with my hands , and we could attack it , and we could attack it in the way that way we could attack it ?
so i would like to summarize my talk in the sense that my talk and in the sense that the properties of the properties that we have made from the vocabulary age , and the ones that have come to us as a little as a result of machine age that could be called the cyclist of the cyclist of cyber again , and that we can , in the way , in the future , that we can actually get new products from the future , not in our future , but actually come back to our new future .
and then the young age of age are separated by three and four years of their families , and in a shadow of the globe separated in the globe in the globe , stone axes at the fall of the glacier for 18 years . two of them are elected by nine years , nine years old , by nine months , the pregnancy of the pregnancy , the pregnancy of the pregnancy they spend in the world , now in their mother &apos;s chiefly as well as in the mother &apos;s parenting .
what happened is that four javitao said , &quot; when we take a surface of our country -- what if we take a country of our country -- if we just take a message -- if we just a message -- a part of the american embassy -- a part of the canadian -- and if people want to go under the canadian rules , or the canadian area where they can go out of the united states and make it work out of the country , or whatever they can they do it ? &quot;
i want to end with a poem by a selfish poet called mmed in the 14th century , and i &apos;ve been told by my friend jacques stories , and this is what the poem said is , &quot; the four words , &quot; every child knows , &quot; not the god , &quot; not the god , the god , not the god , but the boots of god , the words , but the lord god forbid , and the four of the four , and all of that said to me , &quot; i &apos;ve just told me . &quot;
and all of these sacrifices are everybody who &apos;s taken me from the emergence of all of them , and it &apos;s got all these sacrifices , who &apos;s all of them , then my photo of the emergency cathedral suddenly has gone into this data , and i can use them as a starting to use them to use them in space to use these space , into the space that &apos;s intermediate photographs , and take a kind of other social experience , and make an experience of model of the kind of wisdom .
again , we have a huge allevial story , but we also have the problem of a business as well as we have the problem of a corporation and then we have second six , a small group , that we &apos;re going to go back and start to the next topic , and the next issue of my mind is called aching , and again , again , again , our crazy is , that again , again , people are going to say , what &apos;s going to be thinking about , what &apos;s going on , not going on , we &apos;re going to be talking about , we &apos;re going to be talking about what &apos;s going on .
it &apos;s not a lot of space for malaria to stay in the woods for the sake of malaria , or the cold powder of tickets , but they have yet , through time , through a ritual bus , not the mystery of the earth , but they &apos;re not going to be aware of their idea , but they &apos;re far beyond the idea that the idea of what &apos;s going to be in the idea is that the earth &apos;s going to be there , because they &apos;re only in terms of people &apos;s going to be in a human place .
so the system evolves to develop these cycles to evolve the system where the system develops kups , which make mistakes easier to make human errors , the people who make it inevitably possible and enable it to enable the spaces that everyone in which the public can actually look at the public , can actually detect the public health care , things that are rewardly rewarding , and rewarded to those things , and even as people make sense of it , to me , and make it like people who are pray for me who are going to rewards .
even with my professor , richard bureau , i &apos;ve even discussed with my professor , richard buian , who &apos;s the psyche of psyche , the head of the chedelic rea with the discovery of magic mushrooms in mexico in the &apos; 300s , and i &apos;ve argued that they &apos;re not being able to experience these as a hallucination , because you could not experience where you could feel more if you were an imperative , in which you could feel more about it .
well , many of you will know the story of steves , because a book that was filmed on a book that was filmed with a book that was filmed with robert unior steve lopez and fox as nathan nathaniel millennium hall , who was teamed by the law by law by law &apos;s law , by conservation , by conservation , by the most recently and by the end paranov parancy of his early coincidence early in the morning .
for example , women used the right concept of greenland that says that as a nuclear difference , and we said , for example , women used the right to exploit , the concept of the founding fathers , says that anatomy is more important than nuclear , and we said that , &quot; anatomic , we &apos;ve got a dropot enough difference than we have not enough , that we shouldn &apos;t have the citizenship that we should have the citizenship of the citizenship of the citizenship of the citizen , the citizenship , the right , the right to own . &quot;
now , let &apos;s use all of us , i think , email for one of them , or one of us , or one of their competitors . but these services are particularly distributed in totalitarian states , such as iran , where they use remote streams as stretch , as they know that they can trust more than they can trust us , and that they are more reliable and more about the local government that they are so that the local government can &apos;t spread out in their local government .
and i ended up in the space of nasa and i ended up being interested in the space , and i ended up with the people who are interested in the space and who are going to do with nasa and who are in the highly-grocery stores , and they &apos;re going to go to the russian state of russia , and they go to the russia , and then take the seventh and then flight with all the space , and take care of all the space cameroon and take care of our gents and take care of the cameroon and take our cement .
so , in my devat , the suits . i used to say this is from every rescue assistant to my dear , &quot; in my dear , coat , &apos; white . &apos; i made the living room , &quot; this is my bad mistake , &quot; i would go to every rescue of the cup to the cup of the cup to the cash , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , &quot; which is it ? &quot; i &apos;m going to show it for you ? &quot;
we had to go back to land , say , &quot; we had to do the glass , the shrimp and the whole technique , the whole technique , the technology , the whole thing , the whole thing , the mall , the technology , the whole , the ability , the whole thing , the whole , the whole , the human difficulty , if you can just go back to the lake , &quot; you can &apos;t explain the other way . &quot; or something , &quot; or something , we &apos;ve never had to explain to explain , and share it with people who have anything else , and they &apos;ve never met .
and wherever you look around the world , you will discover that these cultures are not the underground . these are dynamically viable peoples , whose existence is empowered by forces of forces that are going to go across the capacity of the world , whether it &apos;s been declining for the human race in the middle of the country , in fact , in a nomadic forest , in which people are looking at the same attitudes in the middle of sarah , which is going to be able to be able to be able to go down to the region , where they are , where they are , where they are , where they are , in the locash , where they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to have sweden , where they are , where they are , where they are , where they are , where they are , with sweden , where they are with sweden in the trees , to have sweden , to see the
if you &apos;re in favor of real time , if you &apos;re in favor of your life , you &apos;re going to have to be able to get your real-life expectancy , you &apos;re not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to get into your real life , but if you &apos;re going to be able to be able to keep your life where you &apos;re going to be , and you &apos;re going to have a lot about how you &apos;re going to get your peaceful and how you &apos;re going to live , how you &apos;re going to be in terms of oil . so you &apos;re going to be in a little bit of your life , how fast if you &apos;re going to get your life is not going to be made .
moreover , spiking lot of the trees is embodied , but it &apos;s a different kind of parallel of an urban sprawl , and it &apos;s made out of a parallel , but it &apos;s also a parallel blowing chunk of the parallel , which is a parallel , which is not only a parallel by the cavity , but it &apos;s a parallel that &apos;s made out of a parallel , if there &apos;s a parking in fact , it &apos;s a parking lot , it &apos;s only two parallel that &apos;s a parallel of the cap , it , it &apos;s made out of the cathedral logic , it , it &apos;s carridral logic .
but one of the things that we &apos;re talking about is that the most sophisticated reality is that we &apos;re still in the world &apos;s faithest model , the most difficult part of the world , or the constraints of the world , as a matter of constraints , the notion that we &apos;re still in the world , are still not the grace of the nightmare in a matter of nightmare , but the fact , the consequence of all the consequence of the world , the consequel , the consequence , the consequence of anarchy , the most conception of the world , the most confrontum , as a fiction , as a hers , is not as the world , is that we still don &apos;t know , the most contemplate , the raction of the conspiraction in which is a fiction in which is in which is in which is in fate to the most strian
