seattle ...
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s singing .
but it &apos;s about it .
don &apos;t find out .
yeah , hello .
we love innovation .
solar technology is ...
that &apos;s not ...
we were poor .
are they all ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
after a week .
great trick ?
we were .
a couple less .
and he says ...
we know that .
ta-da !
wait twice .
here it is .
this is going fast .
you need time .
music as language .
that &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... not yet .
thank you .
what a fish .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
this is efficiency .
wonderful , &apos; yeah ?
totally inefficient .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much .
you know , hill .
the only opportunity .
no hospital .
thank you very much .
stephen watts .
three out of 10 .
that was incredible .
thank you . thank you .
yeah , kind of , kind of .
it &apos;s terrible .
long , yes .
fantastic , right ?
the sun goes on .
oh my god .
we love entertainment .
we pick up .
where do you go home ?
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we &apos;re losing them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
a whole lot .
does that sound good ?
the whole environmental debate .
sounds familiar , what ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
that &apos;s great .
this was fascinating .
can i be honest ?
the farm is incredibly .
what did they do ?
robert gupta .
this is the system .
that &apos;s all about this .
yeah , good day .
lento , slowly .
that &apos;s all i &apos;m interested in .
we can do that .
what do you say ?
not very sustainable .
yeah , milliseconds .
this is our present .
they have similar principles .
yeah , good day .
good work ! yeah !
just do your job .
this was the result .
thank you very much .
and she did .
so you meet al .
it &apos;s essential .
they &apos;re all important .
very different term .
it &apos;s very exciting .
that &apos;s even me .
it &apos;s books .
yeah , that &apos;s going on .
flying cat .
this is the last one .
can we change it ?
these days are over .
these people deserve money .
what &apos;s happening here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
get it back again .
and that &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know .
centers have been built .
what &apos;s happening here ?
but you know what ?
what was the result ?
i was amazed .
it &apos;s generic .
so they knew everything .
you could see manhattan .
here &apos;s the video .
it has sensors .
why not live longer ?
he opens the door .
a few more .
that &apos;s very good .
oh , so the one .
there &apos;s no normal thing .
yeah , i know .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
but you know what ?
i have a question .
okay . thank you .
i stood up to him .
don &apos;t sit around .
so you can do that .
they &apos;re bad . &quot;
so let &apos;s see .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
what do these people need ?
i don &apos;t think that .
i thought about it .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
they use their hands .
so how does this work ?
as you &apos;re interested in .
that would have been okay .
what are media today ?
you can go into it .
so where do we go ?
so it &apos;s true .
how do we know that ?
because you know what ?
she &apos;s not a country .
why do we do that ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
bg : thank you .
this is a wish .
and i was artists .
let &apos;s call it don &apos;t .
not school management .
and the one has to go back .
we can do it differently .
they even hurry .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
an immense challenge .
there &apos;s no food .
it &apos;s against justice .
but the wrong things .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
i &apos;m a writer .
here &apos;s another example .
i forgot children .
it feels great .
i swear it .
i &apos;m crushing .
it &apos;s not going to be done .
thank you for listening .
why should we do that ?
thank you .
here &apos;s an example .
you see it immediately .
it &apos;s not toxic in .
but i continued to work .
or before bombs .
i &apos;m going to go here .
there are two choices .
we need energy miracle .
why does this happen ?
oh , just a moment .
i want to tell you .
what do you want to do ?
this is what happens to us today .
and i continued to work .
so she was back .
and that &apos;s how it was .
yeah , here it is .
i &apos;ll just agree with you .
and why is that ?
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
this is really cool . &quot;
what would all be done ?
i mean the soul .
you do the same thing .
in china , it was different .
luckily not , yes ?
but that &apos;s not protection .
every pee a chance .
does anybody see something particular ?
and i always had it .
very expensive mobilization .
people were playing crazy .
what creates the illusion ?
my gut feeling again .
after just a journey there .
first of all , narrow .
i created one .
yeah . well , good .
think about the camera .
jk : both .
but it &apos;s going to be worse .
so here you see it .
thank you very much .
be a mentor .
maybe 10 times .
but it didn &apos;t .
the data came in .
this is a great question .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
it &apos;s got billions of them .
have you seen these guys ?
but there &apos;s something else .
here &apos;s another example .
is it photography at all ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
ohh .
and then it became international .
there were remixes .
let me summarize you .
okay , some more .
the answer is no .
there &apos;s just a lot of fun .
my name is amit .
he had the experience .
it keeps you frozen .
this is a great question .
is that your opinion ?
a almost identical structure .
and it &apos;s got better .
this is what she did .
it lifted him very much .
here you see the city .
good day , all together .
am i going to like the color ?
ooh , thank you .
some of them came up and went .
i think , rather than that .
dk : 60,000 .
there &apos;s an old study .
don &apos;t be disgusted .
the game is from 2007 .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
he &apos;s called paul open .
now , what do you believe ?
who will make it safe ?
we first have the population .
i don &apos;t like this question .
but what do your fish eat ?
we also call it don &apos;t .
this is precise .
the work of the interpreted .
but where are we useful ?
they had no mass media .
how do we actually work ?
... his own story invent .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
so , what does that mean ?
now , what does that mean ?
private sphere has to be there .
there are online criminals .
we have three main groups .
it was still fish .
it always showed up here .
and then it happened again .
i felt really good .
and many people forget this .
crisis . death . disaster .
it would be insane .
it &apos;s not our fight .
it &apos;s not our problem .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
why not think about this ?
we love technology and creativity .
it would be knowledge .
we &apos;re constantly interrupting each other .
and this opens up a map .
but what do we do with this ?
that &apos;s about it .
what do i look at ?
his name is tempt .
is it going to have my size ?
that sounds crazy , right ?
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
we need to spread the message .
this is what most of us know .
you also have to understand that .
this is what you see down there .
i want to ask you something .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was destroyed on the ground .
and they look like this .
is it about the light ?
i grew up in india .
this is the short-term .
you see the water coming .
i had a good life .
so what happened years after that ?
who are these related ?
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
these changes are coming in .
how about fitness ?
this is the exciting end .
but the key thing is ...
he &apos;s working on this .
and then they put it up .
what &apos;s actually happening there ?
the orange tractor .
they really loved it .
but i felt worse .
they called me up .
woman : surveillance technology .
very frightening .
what &apos;s the soul ?
we don &apos;t produce any more ourselves .
i can claim it all .
he went up and down .
what can we do ?
this is what the graphics looked like .
now i get to the end of this .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
it sounds like maybe it sounds bible .
we were forced to be people .
so we &apos;re too many .
you can &apos;t have bone .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
or is it possible perhaps possible ?
they come from conflicts of conflict .
so what do we need to do ?
they didn &apos;t have books .
this is felix .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
thank you for your attention .
this was the beginning of the journey .
i &apos;m honested to fear .
and then everybody went down .
they saw the big impact .
first of all , second .
well , i was the next one .
let &apos;s -- who &apos;s normal ?
and finally , epic meaning .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
the same thing , just bigger .
who &apos;s most successful ?
you want to feed the world ?
i wanted to support them .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
i just loved two .
one place is south korea .
they also have it again .
this is a natural thing .
my wife told me .
and how did that feel ?
that &apos;s what you can train .
does it make the curiosity ?
so it &apos;s a circle .
so , what &apos;s hacking now ?
this happened to be christmas .
what is this thing for a thing ?
that &apos;s what you know .
they could have better to do it .
the answer is yes .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
and that &apos;s nothing else .
is that reasonable ?
so this is the good news .
it was a huge success .
so you saw something magical .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
2,5 to one , great .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
but can &apos;t be a problem .
they &apos;re always saying , why ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
it was just not invented yet .
now , most of all , it should work .
anyone know what this is ?
for example , these perception in context .
this is a game out of it .
this is god , you know ?
but it was very sad .
so let me remind you .
the answer is no .
and it &apos;s the x .
sometimes i push to very much .
but they do the job .
they are connected to these two people .
her mother moved her alone .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
think about your own decisions .
this picture is from this place .
i see this plotting sign .
and it took 18 months .
tell me about this world .
this is very risky .
and that worked very well .
again , he showed him four .
i learned everything out of time .
and there are hundreds of them .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there &apos;s good news .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
that really made me sad .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
but it &apos;s not that fast .
how can we help you ? &quot;
sometimes the illusion is the illusion .
no , never had ever been an opportunity .
the story is not over .
what &apos;s happened on this day ?
well , we want to go .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
that &apos;s how good you feel . &quot;
they come from the artists .
i should not say that .
the power plant can explode .
this is cool , isn &apos;t it ?
she did it for three years .
you can have these clouds .
the data was not available before .
game is not silly .
now , how could this happen ?
is this all involved in education ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
so , we can also .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
they don &apos;t changed the story .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
don &apos;t taste very well .
game doesn &apos;t just mean child games .
and this was 19 years ago .
what would you like most ?
they create a epic story .
they have so much uncertainty .
the data continues all the time .
no one has ever said that before .
so paul is a terrorist .
and that &apos;s actually what he says .
don &apos;t take anything from the point of view .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what should we look like ?
this is a lot of volume .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
i never do it with it .
she was back , and she was dying .
and of course , that &apos;s incredible .
and here &apos;s the representation .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
an autistic student .
if it &apos;s the garbage right now .
so not like detox .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
we depend on two countries .
everybody needs a gold glass glass .
let &apos;s be my body . &quot;
people were still happy .
it was my first sunlight .
in fact , he gathered fish .
my name is brian goldman .
they divide their experiences with others .
the white lines stand for population .
that &apos;s why i made the movie .
he showed up on the algae .
it &apos;s just not technological .
there are four and a half thousand people .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
every waste is nutritious .
and so we &apos;re too many .
so the question is : how ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and it was an incredible experience .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
but there are two problems .
i started feeling better .
but , but you know what ?
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
and that &apos;s a great dio .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
this is it , very simple .
we are in a field of dangers .
and that &apos;s what we did .
basically , they do the same thing .
this is now one of the images .
what other brand do you do ?
and then something weird happened .
you can play with different ways .
the whole building was made of water .
italy wins . yeah .
the morning , before the game .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
the creativity had to kind of go out .
now , it &apos;s all too easy to have .
the nurse asked the nurse .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
maybe even in our cell phones .
and it starts with a doctor .
i &apos;m going to tell you something .
we use the energy of the sun .
this is all the metadata .
i can claim everything .
it will always be similar to them .
but slowly it took place .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
what are they trying to do ? &quot;
on the other hand , we don &apos;t go .
what lessons have we learned ?
and the shape plays a role .
you can &apos;t store energy .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
okay , the power is really courageous .
once we started a vibrant .
my second mistake was worse .
and she &apos;s going to beat a 257 .
we all love baseball , right ?
somehow , kids don &apos;t make it anymore .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
you &apos;re going to be free to your computer .
because anybody here has masses ?
and then to realize it .
the other things shouldn &apos;t suffer .
this one has the biggest impact .
the movement , to write it .
anyway , not to navigate .
and that &apos;s quite in the beginning .
the truth is more like this .
do you want to solve jeans ?
so you can &apos;t do anything .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
her family gathered .
thank you for your patience .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
what else is risky ?
just be who you are .
i remember my first fire .
what &apos;s a story called a story ?
dark in dark . dark .
i was trying to do something exciting .
but very , very effective , yes ?
but we need the whole thing .
zero-carbon missions , yes ?
this is completely belonging .
let &apos;s get the quiet to us .
mmm , my brand ?
that &apos;s frightening .
that sounds frightening .
next is nuclear energy .
it &apos;s a very exciting phenomenon .
i wanted to be normal about that time .
this is what i &apos;m going to show you now .
once the judge looked at me .
we can &apos;t just do that .
so i went to the court .
i got a fear of technology .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
and there are several reasons for this .
they sell certificate .
it &apos;s not going to document it .
why did i go to medicine ?
it can know where we are .
it spreads itself .
all adults were aware of the risks .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
i like things that are different .
i went to jail -- hard .
that made no sense of my eyes .
this is a child game , right ?
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
and this video is real in real time .
the game begins -- swiss .
otherwise , you can &apos;t have teeth .
what about longevity ?
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
so the correlation is very low .
so , look what happens .
that &apos;s how the dynamic was really changed .
so i just started playing .
and then we said , okay .
yeah , these are the data .
i &apos;m shooting something through the head .
have you ever been neither ?
this is like learning to learn .
because for me , it &apos;s memory .
how and what does he recommend ?
we say in germany .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
music is medicine . music changes us .
it turns out that it &apos;s really hard .
and you know what i learned ?
these will be unresistant .
but what &apos;s going to come in the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and this is a very simple question .
this has nothing to do with science .
and that can make a big difference .
but there &apos;s another reason .
anyway , we need a solution .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
so i listen to that , thank you very much .
they brought the canals .
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
we started 15 years ago .
how far do you get there ?
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
you know what neither is ?
so the first step to one interpretation .
and it &apos;s still not a interpretation .
that has to be the difference .
if you come to that , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
this is just the minimum .
we can regain our nutrients .
anyone knows what three seconds are ?
on the book and on the picture .
this picture reminded me of something .
i think it &apos;s abundant .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but maybe this is not the case .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
i want to show you this .
it was a pretty fate project .
here he &apos;s going to go up the sun .
this is the memory .
these fluctuations are going on .
a has these benefits and risks .
our magazines are read by millions .
lego made it possible for everyone .
private sphere doesn &apos;t stand to the debate .
they were genetically replaced .
i &apos;m the new physician .
i don &apos;t take the same lost .
baseball is full of great statistics .
because we live on a water planet .
do we really want to go into this direction ?
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
this gave you a evolutionary advantage .
and these are the neural structures .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
oh , my time is past ?
something sticks in me .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
so we measured its movement .
this is a picture of the object .
apparently it was quite popular .
you see something fun here .
i really like beautiful clothes .
he can only use his eyes .
but the truth is far away from it .
you can do this all the time .
so this crazy story could be true .
who would ever wish one ?
the netherlands would have been simple .
her father died shortly after her birth .
for a year , we had no cents .
we need to increase the complexity slowly .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
here &apos;s her march line .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
but then you really want deep inside .
you want to be oriented in the museum ?
this was more to concrete .
okay , you really want to know ?
and i had to go away from the city .
we won some prices .
who doesn &apos;t want to make children healthier ?
it makes light from kids .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
no , i mean it &apos;s really serious .
i hold the knife in my hand .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;ll go back to my sleeve .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
we have something that &apos;s not going on .
now i see greek moon .
a billion people are going to be hungry today .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
i loved this fish .
no , no , that &apos;s not going on .
and this sounds very different than before .
he was already over sixth .
i started an institutional institute .
they even get funded funding .
the film hasn &apos;t been provided yet .
we need to think about what marks are .
what do you do with that ? &quot;
i call this the bright tiger .
we &apos;ve been playing since 1994 .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
this is ideology , not science .
and that brought me through that ...
today , 6.8 billion people are living .
very simple , that &apos;s how it &apos;s going to come .
it &apos;s busy making sense .
the hot tags today .
automatically runs to the right thought .
that &apos;s how natural things are .
but it requires a lot of planning .
we can reinvent everything else .
as we think of north .
and that depends on phosphorus .
often in the third one , they forget again .
longer than those other two networks .
the rocks are colored .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
it &apos;s all about mature values .
i started with my usual talk .
this is a very sensitive question .
i learned this from my grandmother .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
we didn &apos;t write these app .
and every morning i jumped on it .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
they &apos;re very good at doing it .
in which words would you describe ?
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
there are also worlds of space .
to ask , what &apos;s the right thing ?
people talk about the judgments .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
the living bears the spirits .
they gave their blood pressure up .
thank you , but the best thing is coming .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of equilibrium .
fortunate productivity . fantastic !
the result of that was catastrophic .
and everybody in this room has to go in .
here &apos;s the olive oil .
bjjn sundin .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
we already have a lot of procedures .
this is probably going to be a public transmitter .
my brother was staring at me .
these are the apple saras .
i talked a lot about magic .
who could have looked at this ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who do you really want to inform with ?
complete on a particular goal .
what do you think happens next ?
they have . they always have .
so this is a hard foot .
it &apos;s yet constrained .
they literally put the shirts around .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll lose me .
most of all , when he died .
so it &apos;s creating two circles .
the byproduct is clean water .
that sounds very unusual at all .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you always get rare animals .
it &apos;s going to be infamous .
he died , broken through the story .
this is how the building works .
they went through each other .
tell you what you feel .
the other one was strong .
so let &apos;s do a little bit of interpenetration .
so here you have this little mechanism .
he &apos;s got tuned there .
they &apos;re interested in the interest of the fire .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
the students are divided to grades .
these things are logically correct .
and this is where you feel it .
so for energy , this is what i got here .
i &apos;ve tried to understand them .
all these generations need a few milliseconds .
and no one seems to rain .
that i had written these crazy things .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
this is just a bit less destroying .
and the curiosity cannot learn .
this is also a paradigm shift .
a dalmaink , right .
you can see from the back to the front .
so from modern in the computer society .
and that &apos;s what they do .
we need to get far , and that &apos;s fast .
it &apos;s a new supply of america .
they &apos;re all embarrassing questions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they are the home countries of somebody .
we &apos;re running through ational rituals .
now look at this curve .
widrithirds just belong to our lives .
i &apos;m treating people in death cells .
they kept us inspired by being inspired .
you might have some mutations .
so scott gets this fruit fruit .
we worked in the night .
so i followed my gut feeling .
he moved back to the silence .
now we saw the reverse effect .
we have all applauded audio .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
so ... so , not so optimistic .
he switches down the bones .
let &apos;s start with the true .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
they had a concept of blue blood .
i thought everybody could do that .
i &apos;ve never learned it personally .
even cats look at this video .
there was jimmy kimen .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
how would you describe your brand ?
we &apos;re talking about cows , frozen .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
no , that was what i thought .
i &apos;m a redundant person .
that &apos;s not the route .
this is a painting of a circle .
the roof was also covered with water .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
and women argued that successful .
we can support them to be good .
look at what you &apos;re doing .
the main man winds me .
sexual reproduction is going to the picture .
i &apos;ll read you the contract .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
this is the truth . i believe it .
we &apos;re talking about twins of it .
it was really immensely profound .
he shaped his head , no .
this is going to be going to happen in april .
we also have very accurate data .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
the mechanism is from the gap .
but with the right design , please .
we can support them to be good .
to say , what is information ?
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
there &apos;s never been a time before .
and even lomg thinks about it .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what &apos;s going on ?
and also , these sources are interrupted .
how will you feed the world ? &quot;
this is an ecological network .
&quot; this is success , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
the koch had coded him .
you put it in the box .
this is a geometric part .
the thing that had just been represented .
what takes fifths of millions of seconds ?
i see the dalmaink .
it may take it until it &apos;s invited .
maybe again , a look behind it .
no , no , far away .
and this picture was taken by atatlas .
156 nations send our channel .
they &apos;re covering their internet connection .
but today we &apos;re far beyond this .
she wasn &apos;t drunk yet .
i &apos;m a person . i make mistakes .
this is the system where we live .
but i continued to ask this question .
and that was what i felt .
we expect a couple of extraordinary decades .
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
you should also ask you what wishes you want .
something very strange happens here .
and that was the outbreak of the outcome .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
it can know how we hold it .
so it comes back a feedback .
boston has not just a call center .
this is a humble little app .
the ufer is from a different place .
&quot; they didn &apos;t let them go . &quot;
i lived in parallel worlds .
someone made an old-fashioned version of it .
and i &apos;d like to read to you .
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
you can be logically and intuitive .
tell me a little bit about this part .
make it possible -- you all here .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
does anyone know what this is ?
so this is the reason for this project .
it &apos;s called &quot; i jump with me . &quot;
let me tell you a little bit about this .
so these kinds of objects don &apos;t exist at us .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
we can give ourselves something like this .
so the first exciting primate .
and there &apos;s some collaborative collaborators .
daniel kahneman : sure .
everybody would like to make people happier .
and the domain also plays a role .
and why ? genetically engineered food .
it &apos;s gray to millions of people .
we have masses now in this country .
not even the truth is free .
because now you can apply a three-sentence .
you can see the tiles up there .
in many cases , these people are totally healthy .
we don &apos;t know exactly why that &apos;s happening .
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
thank you , danny kaneman .
we get a absolutely flat line here .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
because we don &apos;t want to shoot about genes ?
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t do that much .
they run the process , they understand it .
there are some things that need to come together .
and what do you do with the garbage ?
bad ? i was totally confused .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and then he can walk in .
a particularly beautiful story about how i mean .
his personal apples of the seek .
i &apos;m going to try and do that in an unprecedented way .
it &apos;s only got to work out as a present .
but we start to see a change .
this is a year of hydrogen river .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
it &apos;s a small virus of bacteria .
now this level of intuition is going to be very important .
so littingbird is open source .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
they grow five centimeters .
maybe i did it with good reason .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
so let &apos;s get something else out there .
it &apos;s all coming out of our own pockets .
normal people are not available to these devices . &quot;
as an artist , i think , is very important .
here you see roberto dance .
and no matter , italy won the end .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
but the game is a format .
thank you . i have a question to you .
he had 20 minutes of music .
well , i &apos;ll show you .
this is just an insurance method .
it should contain the two elements again .
shake the environment , make less waste .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to talk about .
yeah . she doesn &apos;t discover anything else .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it was an acknowledge .
what you need is a new medical culture .
alone , shame and without support .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
i think our identity is threatening .
many of my mandatory are very young .
my cousins all over the place .
we saw some fantastic representations .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
here are two different jewels .
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i &apos;ve got him on my laptop here . &quot;
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artists .
it &apos;s a very cool food .
the difference will be perceived as loss .
in two hours , they &apos;re growing everywhere .
the emergency room moved all the strands .
no insurance can create quiry .
there &apos;s a lot of great books on this topic .
so this was a problem for supercomputer .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
you can predict that . why is that ?
what kind of assumptions i do ?
it &apos;s awesome that number is rising .
isn &apos;t half or a quarter ? &quot;
so what can we conclude from all this ?
so basically , a translation of translation .
no tree is carbon neutral .
and on , now you see it always .
the next step happened within this communities .
he had put up a lot of natural videos .
this is just the workforce , by the way .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
thank you very much , very much .
so , here it is . right .
this is really the fuel problem .
and ecological was a disaster .
this is a part of her .
it just didn &apos;t come before , you know ?
in other areas -- the world of communication .
this is my supermarket . no big one .
but western governments also help themselves .
sleep manner is ubiquitous .
i &apos;m going to be tired of how we all .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
if you burn it , no .
tell you , there &apos;s no prediction .
can you play me now in blue ?
no , we &apos;re stuck in what &apos;s inside .
and there &apos;s a central point there .
you know , everybody &apos;s eaten .
this is what the norm says .
now , what are archaic models ?
and the list can be done by the end .
so , that was my primary motivation .
new america : find out more .
and the problem is not the technology .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we wondered , and nobody knew it .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
monday : color is something more powerful .
it has some serendipity .
and then it looks like this .
do you remember the winds still ?
so , help me a little bit about this .
imagine mozart efficient .
i &apos;m happy that i &apos;m there .
water amounts have huge amounts of size .
they worry about that we &apos;re getting worse .
man 3 : i &apos;m the museum of the museum .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a license .
now , in terms of instruments , the instruments evolved .
i want to explain this a little bit about a little bit .
in fact , not wanted to make a viral video .
in this three-sentence , three sentences come in front of you .
you know , you &apos;re still from school .
you can zoom in and zoom in .
now i &apos;m going to add a bass .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
if not , somebody else today .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
they laughed more than they do here .
your problem is you have too little .
third : escalation of expectations .
the official dogma of what ?
you just listen to , and then you start to talk .
let me show you how they work .
it &apos;s a game called the following .
i call them &quot; the income billion . &quot;
we think of energy scarcity today .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
you go around and you blow yourself .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
this is something that is built in the city .
second half of time . end of the normal game .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
imagine this just a moment for a moment .
raise your hands . let me see you .
maybe we can see vital as a change .
dumb &apos;s not much better .
people suffer . people fight .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
you know that science is not a company .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so , that &apos;s really what i &apos;ve been doing .
i tried to preserve the body .
life had not changed since centuries .
but that &apos;s how many people got aid over the years .
my grandmother never forgot me to forget his life .
my fourth technology : predicting complexity .
the third technology : categorization .
it takes a thousand square miles .
you get to two because of them -- very simple .
you want to tell me something about my brand .
it was something we knew about .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
donnerdy : self-confidence is the key .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
i wanted to restore health of a disease .
now , if you think about a piece of stuff .
what ? that really made me off .
we reject food changed .
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
we have forced them . puff .
my parents are 80 on the ferences .
and there &apos;s the flavor problem .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drink in information . &quot;
you can jump directly to a certain extent .
you can dive into a particular year .
because that &apos;s what &apos;s happening , right ?
shake the environment , they need less energy .
this is what &apos;s called the osit-model .
now you can see the dalmaink .
and the two final ones are also here today .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
this is going to have to go down to zero .
and i didn &apos;t let myself out of it , but i didn &apos;t know .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
well , he was still inconvenient .
and in time , you can react again .
our goal was to say , okay .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go again .
all of it is compotent of it .
it &apos;s all that &apos;s in it , it &apos;s useful .
this is going to be done in china in a second .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
anyway , they do that in the world .
the permanent ice is labeled with red .
and if not , though , your dance is still dancing .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
my mother asked us to touch their hand .
it &apos;s serious -- the conversation !
now , this cartoon makes some say .
here &apos;s a few on the hampton .
so this is how the supermarket is .
i thought i could integrate myself .
we &apos;re still thinking they &apos;re originally originally .
the three words said , remember ?
i remember it was yesterday .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
well , i went to the courthouse .
i said , &quot; okay , oma . &quot;
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition .
i work in solar technology industry .
and let me show you a simple example .
but it has an unexpected waste .
so that made sense , it was fit together .
yet we seem to be quite satisfied with that .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
scott talked about human being .
and here &apos;s every piece of very well planned .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
is it about the details or the colors ?
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
no one has to give your ideas green light .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
i think i may have heard more hands .
this would be somebody who &apos;s totally intuitive .
eeeee ! no , thank you .
and this is a millionaire concert .
so at this point , we need digital security systems .
so again , the passage really well .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
interacting comes in a lot of different forms .
so let them go ; save the shoes .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
what we want to do is create the future .
i don &apos;t get the real life of this feedback .
there &apos;s a lot of fortune coaching .
let me show you from the near .
it &apos;s about like a potatoes .
shame . shame .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
they were just like the people in this room .
my grandparents made this number at 70 .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
we need to use more research for more research .
there &apos;s every footprint on the side .
i usually would take the needle out .
there &apos;s somebody sitting in the back , who didn &apos;t have childhood .
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
let &apos;s do this as we would have a machine here .
what do you believe in these design students ?
that &apos;s going to be a key element of this belief .
they live with help from chemosynthesis .
i was totally excited about science , you know .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
and every night , they fly 240 kilometers back .
every morning they fly 240 kilometers to the farm .
how about the feeding ? &quot;
natural light then offers a smarter .
that &apos;s what nobody else has done in the world .
picasso , wait , wait for them .
we always create new tensions and conflicts .
that the theme of ecology is a global one .
now i &apos;m going to do something else .
they &apos;re all back to their way back .
and they had to remove what we did .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we have just signed .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
that &apos;s how you can &apos;t get them wrong .
what do you do with certificates ?
this is alfred zalez .
there can be a sequence of changes .
and this is very important in medical research .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
what would you say to somebody who believes this ?
then he would go to the ear .
the rest of the time are delusive .
i start with some simple examples .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
it &apos;s not a choice between private sphere and security .
the question is , why people accept that .
and i got back to work .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silicon .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
first of all , i thought this would be a game .
the storytelling always needs more senses .
and we &apos;re trying to do this all the time with another generation .
today , a lot of people have given the government .
next week , this is coming to the market .
she &apos;s got a button .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
i mean , no one has ever seen a particle .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demands .
the first is a classic , apple , apple .
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
these things have a positive effect .
no one wanted to do something about the movie .
what do you think how the answer will be ?
on the left , you see a little boat .
so i think we need to be leaders .
so we have this terrible idea .
so two pairs , every single baby .
ladies and gentlemen , their relations .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
it was hired of the imagination .
but the best part is -- in a second .
so every concert is a different concert .
so not saving , avoided , avoid .
and everything is just packaging or content .
i could go right in front of my house . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
they &apos;re supporting other people &apos;s mistakes .
i put it , and i went to the treatment .
you know how to call a 4-year-old ?
notice two things about this curve .
and i have to say , there was power to me .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
at 16 , i began to illustrate books .
that our contribution to the system is choose .
there had to be another puzzle .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
he &apos;s not coming out in other countries .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
i never want to make anything different in life .
so i talked a few months later at a conference .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- that &apos;s how they run their fingers .
i want to show you something very first here .
and of course , it did it , but then click .
it was summer , and i had grains .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
and they &apos;re not only going to die of masses .
what happened is that we could do that .
they don &apos;t spend time in power fighting .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . i put it on .
these sentences are absolutely logically correct and correct .
anyway , that &apos;s what i want to do .
technological circles are the same way .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for 9 .
i put it in a particular way here .
at the beginning of the tribal society , through the language .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
so you want to get from the outside to the people .
we don &apos;t make identity , we invent them .
it was a lot los angeles , and i was in iron .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to recognize any pattern from this pattern .
he came up to me and hugged me .
all the people who were , started to share themselves .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
i &apos;m really sorry . does it make it crazy ?
the country on the land would roll it up .
so smarter , a giant theme everywhere .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
we want to do something against death penalty companies .
there are some very interesting developments there .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet , a realistic level is a realistic level .
so the theme of the day : financial saving .
in fact , no , that was not the mistake at all .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
and we still need to improve a lot of that device .
it emerged four and a half years ago in italy .
and i would argue that this is good .
this is a problem that many players have .
the last three of the five i put together .
instead , let &apos;s take a look at the ecological model .
stores off this one , lift the rest .
and that &apos;s what these marks have done .
well , what &apos;s the marke ?
i want to help you to calm .
both of them are survival , both of them .
as i said , amanda carried our elephant .
there were no canadian meloui .
have you taken all your vitamine ?
so this was a very strange experience .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
all of these wind rings are all over the place .
information is a difference that makes a difference .
the only thing they had was their head .
so for him , they were just cloning .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
this is a dead turtle .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
i have something i want to show you .
what would it be like to live in good health ?
we don &apos;t want companies to patch companies .
and i found this incredibly exciting .
they have the flow of the water .
so , we can &apos;t help these things .
in the countries where people come to money .
and how does it look like this ?
we understood that the weather is global .
and in this head , remembering memory .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is a completely unhalf-development pattern .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is gone away .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
there seems to be an imperative .
this investment in africa has been in the last 30 years .
we did it in the last 1,000 years .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
now she understood the advantage of the prototype .
this is the u.s. equivalent of hundreds of years .
i think the first place is the curiosity .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
these were the first calculations of six years ago .
but maybe you can still agree with them .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
it &apos;s not all to be compatible .
if you &apos;re in love with somebody , efficient ?
and we see that it &apos;s made of money .
because we don &apos;t feel real money .
yeah , so what should biohack be ?
here are some people who test it .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
there are the ones that are much more spatial .
the corporate headquarters are right here .
i thought he had kidney rocks .
and feedback to my doctor .
and we also saw this in mobile phones .
we want the number of chimps .
the silence is otherness .
the dna writing was an interesting step .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
but what happens to &quot; whatever happened . &quot;
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the label .
no apple ever shrink that way .
good night , sweet thylacines . &quot;
now he &apos;s making a tractor in the scene .
and they also feel their movements and their movement .
if your job is dance , dancing .
so we damaged about 50 magnets .
these are images about a thumb of six seconds .
but dutch isn &apos;t always such a bad thing .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
they &apos;re going to be rare because we &apos;re going to catch them .
so you don &apos;t have a lot of income animals .
all of these things are unavoided .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
i remember if it was yesterday .
and for me , a character is going to be in the book .
tell me , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
so every trance was a little different .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
i put my job on 95 pounds .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
we found that it &apos;s really weird .
they wanted to have nothing to do with the project .
the answer will probably be &quot; no . &quot;
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
this is something like our camppli .
that &apos;s how you can pull the whole movement into it .
here are the results that we just got right now .
but how do you do that in practice ?
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
i don &apos;t want to do it by reaching stars . &quot;
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
this is the problem i try to solve .
that &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
and they ask : what happens to these moments ?
... that the domain is also a role for play .
probably many of you in the room know this trick .
yeah , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
and i have all kinds of little progression here .
and why ? because paul vaccine made a vaccine .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
well , i understand that . i do that .
the marshmallow needs to be up .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
these stupid movies don &apos;t bring us a money .
i can flip the sequence as it goes down .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
for nathaniel , music means seals .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
because , in fact , this person is not interested in prove .
because we can &apos;t live without that lifespan .
he &apos;s just disappointing them and not himself .
why do i have to afford this little car ?
a phrase with his own breath .
it &apos;s barely spoken in the early class .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
and in my adolescent , i said , expectancy .
it &apos;s kind of a handle of poetry .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say it .
or they didn &apos;t have any photooligraphy .
and that leads us to the one big question .
they virtual reality , and they don &apos;t have computers .
yeah , what do we do for projects now ?
and the world in which we lived like this .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
if you put it in common , this is what happens .
and that was not a hard way to diagnose diagnosis .
i was a obsessional student .
well , really good , maybe a all-star .
wealth , not debt , the result is influenced .
she had the last word in every family street .
the transition happens . we can all feel it .
and we use this word with this kind of temple .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and that worked . applaud for scott .
i met the decision in the united states .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
and that was an experience in dehumility for me .
and finally , we should get transparency .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
or are you more likely to be a down-tribe ?
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
so what are we going to see in the film ?
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve found that .
and this is the planning behind stages .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
each icberg has its own individual personality .
they don &apos;t talk about god and nature &apos;s nature .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
look , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
it &apos;s natnatnatance , and it &apos;s just natarum .
we have the passion of a poet innovator .
this is moore &apos;s law last hundred years .
thank you for being at ted . thank you .
we want to create mass inheritance . &quot;
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
now we &apos;re doing this with boom and machines .
this is the gec center for service and information .
and we want to put this on a global level .
we have all navigous systems in our cars .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , let me show you a little bit more of this .
here we were , and this is the painting .
emc : &quot; you &apos;re called transparency welcome . &quot;
there were a lot of crazy things going on .
from the bird age to the machine age .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same with the disabled movement .
but are we going to make the best out of our game ?
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
so we &apos;ve got 1.5 billion players .
you would expect an extra billion player in the next decade .
but one of them is much worse than the other one .
but you know what you don &apos;t have a right ?
i thought , let &apos;s take the poker same .
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
and so i then met a little unusual decision .
so my two passions flew .
you do something that is actually a little bit different .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
i don &apos;t know who knows this picture .
i &apos;ll just agree that &apos;s logically logically .
i think it seems to be important to lose one .
the question of death penalty is an interesting question .
the child in me is really enthusiastic .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamics .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
today i &apos;m going to report by unexpected discoveries .
the underwater part comes from a quarry .
when i say reality , i mean , i &apos;m going to take a look at reality .
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
and how was that for you ? what &apos;s it successful ?
a little more about you , you &apos;re not .
it was &quot; in eternal , forever . &quot;
tuesday : adaptation is totally overrated .
the dog ! i was in front of language .
would you like to be more attractive and self-conscious ?
she didn &apos;t breathe and walked blue .
the people in the side are now coming in .
but now you can &apos;t count my finger , right ?
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and some of them didn &apos;t work , and some of them don &apos;t work .
so we walk before , and where do we walk ?
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
but you can &apos;t replace the phosphorus .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
we wanted to develop a learning tool for language .
i may have another 40 years of work in me .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
if you want to build hyperbole on the left between the images .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not perceived as a great loss .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
this is the kind of educational schedules .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a lot of studies now .
and we learn how to trust and the rules of the game .
probably one of these numbers must be very close to zero .
and i said , &quot; yeah , very much . &quot;
you can tell things about the world &apos;s influence .
... please , please , please show the slide .
as well , i think we &apos;re doing games today .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the aid doctor .
and i went over , and i just stopped listening .
it also turns out to other places of the book .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
these results were achieved by several weeks of hard work .
this player is about a episode in front of an episode .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s coming out ? &quot;
there &apos;s a program that might be familiar with .
i &apos;m very grateful for the recommend here .
you probably know that he was in 1835 here .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of it yet .
my mother suffered to dream from the boat .
these are the people who shape my world view .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the borf .
we see this in all kinds of life .
and then it was also after the three months .
it &apos;s right , morality , patentm .
the main problem here is similar to aids .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell you about reality .
have a nice example of this .
then i say , heart sorry , yes ?
and we &apos;re so often inventing how we want to recreate .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing kids to the world .
his whole work process has changed .
i said , &quot; come on , oma . &quot;
it &apos;s scores and strange programs .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
but that , what this picture is , is a problem .
there are some places that we can apply to .
we called it the digital water package .
because they have special skills of processing processing .
so here are some natural light worms .
the second factor is the services we use .
it changed my way of making movies , completely .
it &apos;s hard to overestimate the destruction .
so you could feel like selling it to sell it .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
that means that the ants weigh much more than we do .
and that &apos;s what we like to look at now .
geh and jellyard cohen .
so , pull them up and start to invent them .
well , it turns out you &apos;re right .
this is an idea that is worth spreading .
so just imagine two other small changes .
how many would choose for a good memory ?
and this is the story .
so please listen to , if a music is played .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell you about what &apos;s true .
the first two sentences that are logically correct .
we actually know that something else is something else .
now that &apos;s not supposed to be a joke , but it &apos;s not a joke .
so let &apos;s do that once , and then you experience the sentence .
we can continue to do these things in different examples .
what we love about ourselves is the outer thing .
they moved to a natural concept .
so these women were wearing themselves , and they were just signed .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and we designed an ipap app .
dares and sponsors have been removed .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzles .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you zoom in . you can actually go in .
you can see in all these museums there .
how much money is needed to save that ?
think about it . this attack is generic .
and if you don &apos;t , you don &apos;t do anything .
so we start with a wind drone .
he says , &quot; make up to the printers . &quot;
imagine a soundscape airplane .
it &apos;s a totally denial of mistakes .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .
this is another look at the tree of life .
they shared the kingdom in two containers .
this is one of the classical expressions of play .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
we had no child in this country yesterday .
and i need a while to figure this out .
we repeated these exercise with the same students .
you have to be ready to take risks like this .
&quot; look at your bones , pink .
there &apos;s no overpopulation problem of trees .
then you &apos;ll notice that it has a change .
and the third area that explains itself .
i &apos;m happy to talk to you all .
every big picture is the beginning of an absence .
you wouldn &apos;t like starvation , and you know what ?
or are they more like a down-tribe ?
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
this is the consequence that we have to ask .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
game is the kitt that keeps us from .
if you have something to give you , you &apos;re going to have it right now .
how would you want to be better than you are at the moment ?
they teach them to open themselves doors .
antony : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
and here are two patients . these are their records .
i mean , this is a real cognitive bias .
i think that &apos;s true for every human being on the planet .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
so , a climate change will be terrible for you .
i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times website .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
but the volume are much bigger than ever before .
it grows in the winter and shrinking in summer .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
everybody knew her genius was something lam .
we repaired them , repair them .
and the world that we live in now is what it looks like .
but these are all roads in the u.s. s.a .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
child mortality has reduced a tenth .
this is also there , again , coming back .
maniok , something that &apos;s a half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
we walk into the arms of placebo industry .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
where is the greatest interest of what really is doing ?
also , the energy source is very important for them .
we went back to the note of titanic .
because artists have a broken relationship to the gap .
and at all , you &apos;re working a lot less than i am .
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
i will never play more like this moment .
it &apos;s the form of real-time behavior , yes ?
and less usable or user interface is it .
how can i make a little bit more friendly ?
i don &apos;t see why that shouldn &apos;t be like that .
so how do we work if we put in there ?
every society is preferred by a primary medium .
and these interactive portraits are taking each other true .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation .
you may have heard that we built watermarks .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
they get a model that comes from all the earth .
the grandfather of this old manuscript .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
the only problem with this was that she had 10 children .
so in other words , i definitely want what i want .
and i see the same process in combination of photos .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it became almost 200 million times this year .
they had 348 different types of melting .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction .
paralysis is a sequence of lots of choices .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
he described one of them as a very ordinary .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
on one hand , the screen is filled with leaves .
so the sketch pyec-motion movement has done it .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
this year , it became almost 50 million times .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
we should put the balls in the cheese .
are you eight and monuments like seven ?
the life itself has no voice in this choice .
they are in the united states , in europe and japan .
and in the world , everything made sense for me .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
zie , in a moment of headquarters .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
so gender can come up in a lot of different variants .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s being raised as a girl .
and no , it &apos;s not a coherent or san francisco .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open towers ?
here &apos;s the current version of this contract .
it was a extreme situation . you needed a extreme solution .
and this was sort of the first of people developed toys .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
they never get a job that they can &apos;t solve .
i mean , i &apos;ve probably seen flat lines .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
and the film is called &quot; the concrete . &quot;
now , in this area , there are not several thousand goals .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
well , we introduced the mayor hole .
now , today we know everything about where our things come from .
france makes a gate . italy makes a tor .
how do you divide people because of their characteristics ?
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressive values .
he stops every five of hope from my consciousness .
is it true for others , or does it affect us ?
so i say , let &apos;s start the world changing .
edward cava is a volument scientist .
now we spend three billion hours a week playing online .
the biggest difference between them is time with time .
we &apos;ve been trying to get the point of automation .
bg : a energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
and i say , &quot; limits you not a self .
with pivot , you can dive into a decade .
but for many people , this is a little too radical .
so i &apos;ve posted a lot of fish in my life .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
in fact , the notes are very vague and unprecedented .
because we don &apos;t make things more free .
there &apos;s more to my glasses .
as i said , there &apos;s only been a second one .
this is an interactive animation .
and jol√© ! it &apos;s for you to do it for you .
i &apos;m still going to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and everybody knew it worked that way , right ?
i would rather keep doing this work that i love .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
here &apos;s , &quot; your fingers on every light . &quot;
the next step was to find the apps for that .
we still know one where all the tankers are .
so you &apos;re just going to google google project .
what other metamorphosen are they running through ?
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other markers .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to see great .
this constant feedback is not in real life .
i &apos;m going to do it for you , and then explain it .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
a research mester to the theme of the user interface design .
i &apos;m also going to solve what &apos;s in there .
you don &apos;t know anything in this gold fish glass . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great things .
in the future , most crime will play online .
we had no words for what we started there .
now he &apos;s on the red list of dangerous species .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
but i really believe that after us , we have something else .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
the cellular communities began to abstract information again .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
this is great . here &apos;s the digital physicist .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacine .
&quot; don &apos;t go &quot; to be true .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the steck .
she &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s being put together .
also , urban designer and building farmer are very interested .
there &apos;s not even online . there &apos;s no extension .
so this doesn &apos;t work for memory itself .
our steps in digital lives were exponentially exponentially exponentially .
this is a star night , probably never seen that before .
over the course of these discoveries , i learned a lot .
as a child , i always recorded comic books and so on .
when we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
that &apos;s right now our goal .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
we just silent around like this .
a lot of talking about 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
i was quite obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
so when claim says there &apos;s no soul .
by the way , this is the most difficult part in my talk .
i can &apos;t play as much as in 20 years .
both of them would come to me , ask me questions .
so a lot of testosterone , but no response to that .
so the growth rate is accelerating itself .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my chart .
11m is the highest thing i saw .
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
that &apos;s how you think of weighs to the weighs .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
now , how do people die in such a hack ?
the first story is by charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and you can see this green point there in the middle .
i sold snakes in the whole country , around the world .
this is my meat , and i can rotate it around .
this is the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
no , that &apos;s the right thing , right ?
many of you are covered by faces and so on .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
in both cases , surgery was surgery , and it was fine .
she didn &apos;t have a treatable brain damage .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
and the fish also had the fortune to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the language of language .
it was the errors of debris against drugs .
this is actually an extraordinary honor for me .
there &apos;s more in there , it &apos;s even deeper .
but we just know a little bit about where things go .
ok , imagine how extreme self-motivation .
i know what people think when you see that .
ask questions , ask them evidence , ask them to illuminate .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
this is how it used to happen in the village .
this is what &apos;s happening to the nano-machine age .
there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
they put them on the beatles machine .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental disorder .
she could find a time learning framework within a time learning framework .
... it &apos;s crowdsourcing crowdsourced .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
i worked in a coal mining work -- dangerous .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there &apos;s sweeping and he said , so ?
that means to go back to the board .
so , as a human being is about certain things .
and , of course , how does design impact on perception .
for those two billion , but it &apos;s a disaster .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambiguity .
anwalt : i &apos;m a lawyer .
we have abstract abstract a abstract language .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
but in this night , it was a greater fun one .
we had to worry about the lawyers , etc .
it was called the automatic rock .
inottaar is a certified place .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to do ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it be ?
it slows down for one of our big problems .
we see the process that feeds itself from themselves .
thylacine ? yes . live ? live ? y.
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
but you can combine something special like this .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
because the images eat it for them to be recommended .
burger , and whales , you &apos;re in this museum .
the idea is to translate a digital security system .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i &apos;m going to explain it .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is great . i love the placebo industry .
in fact , the advanced society is based on energy progress .
this was not a film , no hd , that was real .
i wasn &apos;t there a long time ago .
because you know , this is a fun process .
have you ever seen a client tree ?
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i described .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
it &apos;s time to reaccept america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
frosty , the guy &apos;s going to clean every day .
this is a organism that we described in 1996 .
so i go back a step back , and i get the views .
i filmed in war areas -- difficult and dangerous .
so we should better figure out what the goal is .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
if we make cities , this is actually a big thing .
if the child is born , it looks like a girl .
in other words , game is our adaptation joke .
can you imagine something good , which comes from tabak ?
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
you can just call a few names , and people will understand it .
diphases , rows , child paralysis ...
this is a variant of one thing that was done .
now , the energy episode is about time .
and it was an experience that i couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
we &apos;re going to show it in the open sequence of the movie .
it caused immense jewelry in the control room .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a pig .
it &apos;s this bible , it &apos;s injured flavor .
the shrimp eat the physical lankton .
and that &apos;s how he &apos;s driving his quirky circumstances .
and then there &apos;s a lot of simulations of simulations .
however , this was not in the apartment years .
the music theater is the extension of our body .
he lived only nine years old .
hey , puma , do you really do serious ?
a baby needs about a sixth wind .
so i know about some who don &apos;t have added .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone from here .
it &apos;s like asking someone to hide the sun .
please follow me , because the circle will close .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s going on here .
this is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of thousands .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
bruno giusi : thank you . thank you .
i have a friend who &apos;s driving a passenator .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound .
and because we &apos;re getting older , we &apos;re going to get the wind bigger .
this is the period of time you fall in love .
and today we &apos;re still very , very strong to stories .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and the predictions of how they read them are serious .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
and i don &apos;t expect it to change .
it &apos;s also my big , life-long love and fascination .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
why do they acquire us if we can &apos;t buy ?
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
and they do this because of the content in the images .
a few years ago , i started to develop livelists .
the brows tell them still as untouched .
my grandfather was during the prohibition in prison .
she was a weapon , strong woman , she had effect .
so , in a sense , the technique gives us the technology .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but what is the trick that makes it more realistic ?
but what if you want to see the paintbrush ?
but my logical side didn &apos;t like it either .
i just want to say a little bit about salad rescue .
blaise , this is really incredible . heart happy wish .
we also brought littingbird to design schools .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go to justice .
my uncle died on alcohol .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also lovely .
in fact , we &apos;re also one of these different roles community .
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
let &apos;s call the animal beginnings , it costs a lot of money .
if a neighbor helps the other , we strengthen our communities .
ohhhh , wowwww !
they always worry that they &apos;re losing regallows .
50 percent of their decisions have been made within nine minutes or less .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and my talk today is maintained by this cognitive act .
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
open the map , jump with a click .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a lot about transparency .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
you could also use ordinary design -- technology to spread .
one of my friends did it -- richard bollie .
imagine these imaging points could actually start flying .
i &apos;ll smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
these are the kinds of questions that we need to face .
i was fascinated by the elephant and beauty of biology .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
and this is from an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
i mean , how much toes are we from our memories ?
the more money you earn is power .
that our survival of survival is connected to every single one .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
and yeah , i have a problem , as you might see .
secondly , photos should have the same illnesses .
my mother , my sister , and i slept in the same bed .
for instance , if you were somebody who &apos;s totally logical .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to get out of it .
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of statements .
and the movie is going to be called &quot; the boxes . &quot;
i &apos;m jessi and this is my suitcase .
i just think it &apos;s more like him , not true .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy it . thank you very much .
but it turns out that this isn &apos;t all .
i mean , we ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
these are a lot of towels by masses , 20 an hour .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my death row .
because they &apos;re the ones that are also experts for taste .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
i mentioned that in mid-rubber , and he sent .
so the furniture of the bars also better the system . &quot;
and then , immediately , i think , that &apos;s unfair .
and also , what you would think of today in the spirit .
and the oil is going to replace us through other energy tags .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t do it .
like algae -- and other horrible things .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
it was completely closed that it could fail .
so i got it right , and i wanted to get more .
and immediately , i see a different pattern that &apos;s going on .
yeah , this is what it looks like at the bottom .
that &apos;s not because of resource efficiency , but it &apos;s effective .
we &apos;ve been using three years now .
and if you can , i &apos;ll find some of the strange ones .
i know now that it was the reason it was .
and this was the first time i went to do this .
i was studying woman printer , and she was in breathwhile .
and all the time , i gathered more and more knowledge .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a beat up 300 .
in 2010 , we had been connected to two billion people online .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
and the illuminating the way through the rest of the book .
&quot; because they &apos;ve been holding tomorrow today , &quot; he said .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropy .
this approach is true of all new things that we do creative .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone here in this audience .
now , your life itself is not going to be happier .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
here &apos;s a picture of an ordered in kentucky .
he &apos;s got a feeding of 15 .
i can say the cancers are a man .
we &apos;ve been moving in the so-called bird age .
this is 20 feet above sea level , like greenland .
this is the audience that we just recently finished .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here you are .
but you can , if you &apos;re in a foreign place .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
and all of a sudden , it didn &apos;t seem to be more human .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
or do you want to be more powerful , more power .
and i don &apos;t just succeed , even though that &apos;s what &apos;s heard .
my great-grandparents died when they were 60 .
now , where are we going to go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
this is what they &apos;re all in the suburban phase .
and of course , you can never give it to germany . &quot;
one government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
and the more open i spoke , the more i should tell you .
and i celebrate , i kind of like a little kid .
obviously , that &apos;s not going to fit into my tiny suitcase .
if you &apos;re happy , you get other happy people .
these are masters in spiders of spiders .
how can we transmit these feelings from the games into reality ?
this is how it was made of the same , bad team under the best .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worry .
so the people in the west really thought about creativity .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
one of them was that the phone was never broken .
we can tell the way we can predict the structure and function .
a few months forward , and i had just forgotten everything .
even who kills someone , is not just a murder .
for example , the invention of language was a small step in this direction .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
and this video was actually done in january .
every one of these topics , of course , was made of many , many smaller decisions .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing the time .
today i want to tell you about circles and openings .
they interact with their environment and their experiences .
you can do your friends and neighbors . thank you .
you know , there was no mandarin paradise in paradise .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with them .
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting is the vision .
i apologize that i have to be so strong .
secondly , what economists call an opernicus east .
and i think that &apos;s what the world looks like .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
so it doesn &apos;t change anything , and yet it changed everything .
we &apos;ve just crossed the 7-billion-dollar brand .
then let &apos;s promote this analogy in the future .
so , if you ask the light back , you could do it again .
it was a store called the dragger .
are you going to be far ? you can see a little nervous .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
the things that are just used are going to go into technical systems .
so the device you see there is not working .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
they did that by taking the land off .
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
you &apos;re going to welcome the fear . you &apos;re going to welcome the risk .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
there &apos;s only the second best one , just the firefighters .
they can sneak away , where they go and stand .
an amazing error rate . one of nine innocent .
i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually going to have a wheelchair of a wheelchair .
this is somebody who &apos;s safe in the rest of the gene for about 10 .
we used to be used to the fact that things are linear .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black boys than mandela .
you &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the gangs .
and then people would be able to eat that , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
because that &apos;s where the real government is happening .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what do you add ? &quot;
and then we started negotiating with the insulin lanes .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
i &apos;m going to play what might mean by sounds .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re helping them , ask them questions about the people .
but also , our perception of ourselves , as it fails us , too .
and other examples are the ambient , intelligent systems .
how many doors have the house where they live ?
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells even well .
i believe that , and i have the sense , we should teach that .
and i guess a lot of you have done that .
some people were disappointed that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
i sent them home without talking to my doctor .
the cost of solar energy has been dropped in the last year for 50 percent .
we have to put ourselves on the machine government &apos;s own .
there &apos;s a direct return to the real-world conservation system .
the software takes a few years of software .
and sure enough , we can find fast food chain .
cats look at cats that look at this video .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
and what happened was that i needed a experts .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned language .
i just wish i could see my kids growing up .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
it has moments of life , one after the other .
and i recovered them to fund an expedition .
we &apos;re talking about the fluctuation of information output .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering collective engineering .
that &apos;s what happened in the first year half of its advertising .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
so they &apos;re moving around and making art installations like this .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
i was shocked and crushed to the inside .
i went through the emergency room on my way home .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
i say that because i think identity is very important .
because all these new technologies today are feeding themselves .
because your life depended on whether they did the job right .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
i knew she had come to be there .
today , we don &apos;t just find gene about something , we do with it .
a typical wal-mart provides them 100,000 products today .
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
i mean , this is just what my logical side says .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is what &apos;s truly amazing .
in the pre-example , it was about finding individuals .
he said he didn &apos;t . he will ask questions .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought to you .
if you don &apos;t move it anymore , you dig it .
wouldn &apos;t you want to do it , to make these changes in your genes ?
which would you like to have , if you could only have one ?
again , what potential do we want to call this ?
i say we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
so 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number from two reasons .
when we looked at our feelings like feelings with income .
and this is a little hard to justify , i think .
there were no christmas trees . we did everything .
and we should not . our healthcare system is mimic .
our imagination is a force that can even create reality .
the program that i use here is a little experiment .
look at miguel , farmers like miel guel .
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals ?
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not so sure .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
the words , so long his friends , spoken now .
and we found that there was a context in fact .
do you know how many decisions do you make in a typical day ?
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
so the driving force behind this is the cybersuperpower .
i didn &apos;t spend two years with my wife &apos;s wife .
the pilot made the machine to go to the hudson river .
the openness is that death is a part of life .
that keeps us at the distance , and lets us evolve .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
it rains about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
you can see the person who asks what &apos;s going on inside the inner .
in most of my activities , i have two hives .
as it turns out , dna synthetic is very difficult .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we think about our future as a prediction memories .
now , the memory itself is a storyteller .
what it said was the memories of the experience .
we &apos;re going to meet in the next few days .
there &apos;s a step-by-step-down there .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
there &apos;s a fish to fish , but also a bird reserves .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love story .
this first one , that was more like a passionate monkey .
he &apos;s very happy about it , because he &apos;s deceived it .
because the music is a language , and it &apos;s a language to communicate there .
and , above all , i think , is what &apos;s the right thing .
but i &apos;ll do it just a little bit more curious .
i started thinking , i should just put this project in the project .
we can , of course , look at the garbage problem .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
just to precise time scores , they overcome .
if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
so you can ask : how happy is this living self ?
most of them are completely ignored by memory itself .
don &apos;t please tell me that these things have no consequences .
did a single person in the audience ever see somebody on masses ?
it turns out that you can get it to zero .
you can test it to my talk to your immune system .
but of course , it &apos;s the sum of all , a lot of ideas .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
so this , in every store , you can get the things back .
so the question is , how do we deal with this wind ?
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
so , for example , your environment , your environment , less car .
and the lives lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
so if i put them on the side of the box , it &apos;s your interest .
could i look at this as if i could just write a song ?
she said , &quot; well , it would be like a thunder of the air . &quot;
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious about what we need .
and they say , &quot; doc , what should i do ? &quot;
they put a blue on a green , and they can make light .
but they don &apos;t take the precedented losses .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast .
yet we &apos;re still coming to the galapagos islands .
more and more people came in , just because they were angry .
it was fear of terror that made her life shaped .
but it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
we have a lot of cells that are not based on themselves .
you make the mistakes now , and you spend a lot of time on it .
and what &apos;s below is what we call bureaucracy .
but where would the next aed to help this patient ?
you have to make 62 different decisions to design your car completely .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go like this .
almost as if we were prepared for our lives .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego space .
i was the only one who could talk to the airplane .
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
think of this as a space , as a flying space point .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going to do .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the coming years .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
they get their judgments in more . they almost never do .
most people usually start to orient themselves to the task .
you &apos;ve got to imagine the enormous challenges you have to imagine .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize .
if you walk , yes , every footprint will destroy the ground .
if we do it , we can go back a little back .
the most powerful mountain workers is the head of massey .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a book .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is just going to be worse .
and the online criminals of criminals are very easy to understand .
because through marine protected areas , we basically put the past again .
i &apos;d like to finish with a story that really got me excited .
sometimes i lose the equilibrium . a story to the end .
i found that technology should be able to make magic and not kill .
so we &apos;ve returned the time renewables .
so today , evolution can happen in time period of microseconds .
here he lifts a rare tailor .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
we could reduce that , of course , 10 percent , but what does that do ?
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
car color , outside of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
they don &apos;t even get out of the museums .
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
i became the miracle part , not to die on this day .
it &apos;s called eyewitness , and you can see the description .
this is the average size of a greenland iceberg .
i mean , what does anybody do with so many outfits ?
and as a general term , we can use the word &quot; internal sexuality . &quot;
so the question is , can we do that ? i think so .
we all have to believe that we can &apos;t see .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , it &apos;s called miel guel .
because he doesn &apos;t know what bunch of them should go first .
then the same thing happens in a good , talk .
i have to tell you , i think this was a big mistake .
we take pictures of these mini-buttons , all in detectors .
economists call this a parect improvement .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what gives us modern progress .
the freedom to maximize is to maximize .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
this is a whole book , an example of non-lethal data .
and of course , we all share the same adaptation .
and that &apos;s what happens in the fda of intrinsic .
there are cases in front of us , like the intrinsic .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just from our heads .
i want to help you with a very particular aspect of curiosity .
because frankly , every project has his own marshmallow .
ceo is a little bit about average , but this is going to be interesting .
because even though he &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
this is a proof by the way , by the way , that men are not pigs .
this deputy ran across to the older black black .
but i don &apos;t know how empirical people will be .
you go around the block , and you take it as an open barrel .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the temple room .
bonobos are related to our next living relatives .
the first of those is an aspiration , to give complexity complexity .
they invest a lot of their time in the combination of the growing structures .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little supports it .
usually you &apos;re just danger , and some of you come , some of them don &apos;t .
now he mentioned the minerals of physical lankton lankton .
i take the breath of the audience , consciously , or unconsciously .
you feel , that &apos;s the real truth behind it .
but the question i want to throw up is : why not ?
and the best part of this is what &apos;s expected in health .
this is technology supports innovation , which is today .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
wr wants to help people who have been convicted .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
how did he get to look for this particular way ?
let &apos;s jump back to moma , again in new york .
tempt is going to be part of the show of what &apos;s pretty upset .
we &apos;re producing androts and we &apos;re talking about androids .
and if you do it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
that &apos;s scandal , and we should be ashamed .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple practice .
but while you &apos;re talking to different people in the world about these possibilities .
they have a renewable energy of five percent .
and they did this with the so-called lead-maps .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so i &apos;ve been busy doing that when is , of course , intuitive or intui.
and this is just the biohacker , the individual people .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to the scientific achievement .
this struck me when i wanted to dress my jeans .
he invited the king of sideways to the dinner .
but somehow , we create it from this problem .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half-year .
but instead of crying in panic , he just stopped .
how about both tears that we can &apos;t even predict ?
if you look at the people you have to do it with .
and guess what we found in the angular code ?
imagine that every single person is tasted by people .
okay , let me get a little bit of blood to you .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
new investments to create good job jobs .
six of them : social decline . seven : 65 deaths .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with me like this and play with me .
and that means that the player &apos;s going to make sure that the player &apos;s going to be safe from 10 sleep .
a long time ago , there were gray whales there -- 500 years ago .
in many ways , you &apos;ll say , these are crazy ! that &apos;s good .
the x-rays of a piece of a piece is this comparable .
from my angle , i looked at the janitors and went off .
light bully in a glass of glass , i always found very exciting .
for example , this image , for example , has about 10 billion points , i think .
so i decided that when i was 15 , i was going to be diver .
here &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do . we &apos;re looking at the center here .
and within less years , lego moved in every household .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
by the way , i haven &apos;t learned that in my work as a lawyer .
and i want to show you my outlet for this week .
56 percent of all the rape cases don &apos;t come to court .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-replied .
i asked him how to become such a fish experts .
there was the nuclear research facilities of the oil plant .
from this time , an anecdote that you might know .
no longer necessary to whistle a goodbye or singing .
and six milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that goes back a lot , in the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
so i think it &apos;s a very yellow hack .
i think it &apos;s kind of like a sixth dollar or something like that .
this actually took two thousand really simple shape , this networks .
finally , one solution , the big enough is to solve our problems .
so , this looks like a basketball plate .
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
i wouldn &apos;t have better to do it . i didn &apos;t let myself down .
well , in fact , the number of violent crimes didn &apos;t change very much .
i ate it first in a restaurant in southern spain .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity &apos;s humanity .
it was always so inspiring , so refugee .
the death penalty in america defined by irritum .
they turned the mosquares on the side . they went home .
alone , this airport has a surface of 100 square kilometers .
i like things that are odd . i like special things .
this is my marke in my little , distorted industry .
so maybe you should have a little bit of this interview before the interview . &quot;
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leaders .
here &apos;s a clip from this angular code .
we &apos;ve got his bed , so he can see out there .
we &apos;re degrading a man who has a value for our society .
we &apos;re using games to get the suffering of the real world .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have a trust in the system .
what about child survival ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : it is .
the secret is that the game of the key to these skills is skill .
this is actually the true anesthesia of man and machine .
a few . probably about how many creative people there are here .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons of tons of sound on the planet .
i grew up with a cave science fiction .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building sites , not intense .
so there was finally a company trying to do it right .
the component is becoming more and more of the friend you live with .
and i &apos;m not sure if they really stay alive .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little bit of flight .
there was , i think , a very good code .
in fact , nasa showed that there are many of them out there .
they like to increase the paralysis and the satisfaction .
now , i wondered , how can i really get this over ?
it &apos;s an independent area . they &apos;re all controlling minerals .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view .
somebody had broken up , and had the fooled system .
photos like this : a building along a much riding road .
the biggest fear they had before edges , rape and death .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to get all of these extensions .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange landing street .
but this time , it &apos;s a very good business opportunity .
i brought seven little underpants , and this is all .
but a lot of people are moving into a very strange position .
our gut is a wonderful friendly environment for these bacteria .
now , the two types of self are two understood by happiness .
now , the life itself lives its life continually .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness .
it &apos;s just a cold calories . it &apos;s mimic .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
ah , the majority . i like to see this as a doctor .
my inspiration comes from a event , which is 2,500 years back .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
it &apos;s the renewables that they &apos;re called often .
this is a fish that &apos;s in the south western corner of spain .
so i &apos;m asking , how do i compose this diagnosis ?
the notes have the function of the letters in a script .
then that &apos;s the agreement of the pre-industrial cultures .
that means you &apos;re navigating about sound and rhythm .
so this is just one application of many that you can do with it .
and then we &apos;ve been working with a coherent coding .
on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to lhc .
should i write this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
this is what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
54 percent of the deaths were sleeping through boxes .
essentially , the emphasis had become the building block of our time .
how would it be with a new set of new , never before .
how can a judge somebody turn into something he &apos;s not ?
in many areas , people had to have fear of lynh mobs .
so , programs , which can be made at the former numbers .
for instance , the fish was taken on a glorious flight .
it &apos;s not allowed to have been allowed to encourage , it &apos;s encouraged .
so i took a few years ago to do that .
after all , when we were to write , we should welcome the fear of welcome .
an eight-year-olds , played marke . how is your brand ?
why is it important to start ? what does the red ?
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free from limitations .
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
now , in this night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
and the crucial indicator is the extinction of the languages .
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s no test for this test .
and this is called androgenic defect .
we &apos;re developing ourselves to collaborative thinking , heart beings .
and this is what i wanted to study as a ph.d. in .
at the moment , they &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about genetically engineered food .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
so i offer a $ 100,000 price to software for the winners .
one day , this mirror , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
there was no piano at the time as an instrument .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
even if you were to shoot now , you would have emissions .
most people know the most people from the software area .
this is actually live in the internet . you can check it .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nunavda .
but nothing was invented , that would leave me again , until now .
and the best thing about this is that they connect with magnets together .
some of my smarter passions in the last five years .
i looked into the radar , and it was a little bit of a little pink .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular tongue .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
so the dramatic numbers come to the prison stairs .
i gave some talks in germany about death penalty .
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkeys today . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
this is my lander waage . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
what context is the idea of the thought and feelings about them ?
and if the threats are dangerous , things can happen really bad things .
and that urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
in fact , if we don &apos;t take phosphorus and abandon it .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the magic thing for me .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours of video is invited per minute .
if you could do it for the people , you could also help me .
and so just disappeared that all these companies , one after the other .
i &apos;m sad that we never know each other as adults .
think about it , it &apos;s free , no one of us deserve to it .
so if we do something with the cities , this is a big thing .
and so , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individual alism .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individual alism .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go to the house .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
specialized skills and processing skills and their combinations lead to success .
people here have contributed to the development of this miracle .
and somehow , we have to make changes that are going to go to zero .
we &apos;re still finding other odds of what their rights are .
this is the time of most perceptions that we have .
this is our youngest tape on the bottom right there .
by the end , the lhc will be reoperative again .
and this is the message i took in medical school .
do you know how to call a 30-gallon in northern baseball ?
i think that in many places that are the opposite of poverty .
if someone lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
and so i think the ted community should be him .
and it &apos;s spread , of course , of course , of course .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say , thank you ted .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
now , finally , the movie has a very big deal to get it .
this is actually just a period of two to two weeks .
these people will be connected to the film -- forever .
so all these green areas , these are the most sophisticated environments .
one is called jazz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; swiss . &quot;
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of god to make a long way to virtual .
i went into the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
in the short time , one of the things that i realized is ted : ted has a identity .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good intuition to actually take out the experiments .
in my opinion , mass inheritable has changed our world .
this is all right now , and in the future , will be much more possible .
so the combination is allowed to put together by binary , trust and each other .
here it says , the more you remove , the better .
people said , do you don &apos;t have fear to succeed ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , but i can live with it .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely unsurrounded .
i love this : &quot; watson forced human enemy . &quot;
i looked at her , and i smiled , but she looked very seriously .
three months later , i moved around , and the adventure went on .
it &apos;s about creating needless goods .
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gray sounds and such a stuff .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony with tony .
this is what we want to use as a possible impulse for the river .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology to it ?
for example , i don &apos;t want to give you the same rights as a human being .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and that &apos;s very fast .
i played the first sentence of beethovens .
the person is supposed to have the monkeys or a common ancestry .
and loud signs , f and b , etc . .
how were his living circumstances , how the society and politics ?
on september 10th of september , the machine went to the first time .
we &apos;ve distributed livelists of children , and they &apos;re playing with it .
and when i listened to her , she made kepler noises .
and i was good , i sat down with claude .
but if i ask you , how are you going to do this with your wife ?
you collect information about the piece in the secular literature .
there &apos;s a lot of people working with it , and they can all be engaged .
but how would it be if the picture connects to all of your images ?
you say that you will never forget the names of the names .
but she does something that no other registered technology .
because the categories tell me how to hold them apart .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .

and of course , you can only , if you &apos;re going to be here in some way .
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to prevent people &apos;s knowledge of it .
or c , because you put it into them that they &apos;re undivorced .
yeah , kids are from nature of curiosity or should be curious , designers .

a year ago , or so , i read a study that really got me right .
i &apos;ve done all these films , these documentary movies , for a very small audience .
it &apos;s something between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
well , with seventh , you just have dreams , but you don &apos;t have a significant memories .
so , not more numerous , or kryptic codes , but just a metaphor .
and so we started with the question , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
and if we have an energy overall , we will have water in the river .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s the reason why it seems so confusing .
i rather talk about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
well , tosh.0 forgot it , lots of blogs started writing about it .
so here , for example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a newspaper process .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to make it happen .
because if the wine is far , and the person is there , i open it .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of points .
they are 75 percent of the energy consumption -- to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct this values .
and this really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories -- it starts immediately .
sounds crazy . but this goes back to the fact that the imagination can create a reality .
and he called this part of his curse , the potential of the human willingness .

we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe that you can solve the technical problem .
and the title of the talk was , as you get to a hundred percent renewable .
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be as trees , right ?
and now i can take the filter with the headless stuff , so i can control the live effect .

think about it , that a group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people &apos;s lives .
there &apos;s usually no deadline that you need a miracle to a particular date to take place .
we &apos;re cheaper , like the same system , if the same price goes five percent per year .
we could only be seen as amorbability by the world &apos;s oceans .
and that &apos;s what the whole thing was doing , of course , is a lot more friendly , but it &apos;s also , of course , much better .
in short , a six-sized computer is a active computer in the size of a cookie .
this is called -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
so the things that i &apos;m talking about are a special problem of modern , rich , western societies .
every second day , our senses are starting to start more information than our brain can ever process .

when did you hear the last time you heard of somebody &apos;s eruption about failures about failure ?
you usually get out there , if you ruin a city of 311 .
to get a realistic result , it &apos;s going from me , so it &apos;s out of planning .
so we met in dezember in the president of a hotels in miami .
they say that all the things that are being put up there is a life cycle .
and it makes me excited about the democracy in terms of democracy .
so when i was a graduate student , it was the filmmaking .

i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects are missing .
well , every year we have a lot of carbon dioxide , over 26 billion tons .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what the devil is .
i think that can be changed by making recombination vaccines in the foreground .
he got an intracted antiangiogenesa , and he got a few days later .
the unhealthy way i talk about is the one that makes you sick .
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing when you &apos;re in the middle of it .

in the united states , you &apos;re looking at the experience of happiness .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
and because i &apos;m interested in the fire bribe , i &apos;m interested in pyrotation things .
but what i would regret , because music is a beautiful , communicable thing .
but sukzessive then pulled this script as a primarily medium .
and the sighters are an example of a new generation of aid to digital data .
you &apos;ll never be pleased . because your expectations , my expectations , are high .
yeah , you know , if you &apos;re healthier at this point , there &apos;s not something wrong .
every single music will be made when you get dumb from the outside with music .
it &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about linear earity , it &apos;s about scales .
the interesting thing about this is that at the time of the human being was still media and medium itself .

and over the course of eight or nine days , they were going to get rid of the paralysis .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
and so the film is going to study this whole idea -- this is what ? in eternal , for always ?
the good things like evil , and as you might think , are going to make these decisions about us .

the actual significance of the word &quot; roots &quot; in the word &quot; ct . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion player that are extraordinary in whatever .
all these photos are connected to each other , and it creates something bigger than the sum of the parts .

this could be the evolutionary origin of : &quot; you package him with the eggs . &quot;
we &apos;re working with universities in all sub-saharan africa , and we invite them to learn how to make social design .
so many people in the world are spending at least one hour per day with online games .
this creates a very strong picture in your head , which is much stronger than a white mushroom .
now , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to do , and then we talk about the meantime .
but at the time , as several root organisms , the things started to change .
but now there &apos;s a brave , new solution to free ourselves from this abundant .
so here , i think the art and the movie may fill the gap , and the simulations .
over the last three decades , the breeding rate in america is unhealthy .
it allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
and they developed special structures that didn &apos;t do anything different than working within the organism of the organism .
it &apos;s going to give this little blood pressure , which you put on an iphone or something like that .
and the base lesson , i think , is that the construction is actually a commitment of sports .
but in the end , it was that i took space scientist to take us into the deep sea .
or better , how can we create conditions that feed every community , to feed themselves ?

four : evil cartels . five : dangerous cross-weapon .
and i think that our current punishment is not helping help anybody .
we need digital security systems where a human machine doesn &apos;t respond fast enough to react .
so we thought we could start to write a completely new chapter in the area .
is that something that you can share with us , because now you have a few minutes left ?
this is the planet that we live on . they don &apos;t do it as if he &apos;s not .
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agrarian model for the future .
and they &apos;re designed to design through the design that a farmer can just restore them .
man 2 : the brand that i am is , i would say , fly .
i even learned him from the cub scar scrap of the pills in the 1970s .
within a year , you take a pig and then you start with the commercial fish .
and the child is playing , after a memorial , rather than a red red one now , a blue flower .
virtuality is suddenly strangled for us strangers , and has nothing to do with reality .
but we know when we talk about this , the social relationship is very sensitive .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re more likely to see this face in the real life , if we solve difficult problems .
climate change : do you have one or two sentences to convince you ?
by the way , about a hundred gigawatts of electronics are built on the same basis of the world .
now for me and for the composers at the time and what they might mean for him today .
steve pinker showed us that we now live in a very peaceful time of human history .
you &apos;ve got to go up to the top , the fire , and you &apos;ve got to get a couple of shoes . &quot;

and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of suffering , if you haven &apos;t experienced it on the bottom level .
whether it &apos;s a place where it &apos;s a mental place or a bunch of error , it &apos;s irrelevant .
and that &apos;s an idea that if you think about it , can only fulfill with hope .
have you put this buzzer for an extra effect , and you &apos;ve made a noise machine .
i spend most of my time working with people in research , prisoners or death cells .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explosive curve .
for instance , as an example , the most sophisticated version of this communication kind of communication is the human language .
you &apos;re a upgrade tribe ? are you going to get your blood into whales ?
now , look at what happened on this day , just at the watch of the activity that &apos;s happening in the network .
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .

this is the first object you can see in the quantum mechanical superposition .
woman : if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classic mermaid of the rio .
what would you do that you would shoot , because you think you were forever ?
while we were crashing , i had this feeling , human being dying , it &apos;s not terribly frightened .

you &apos;ve probably heard about &quot; level &quot; and &quot; + 1 strength &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
that will , i think , in the next two or two decades , will be part of the national statistics .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not steam specific .
if paul talks in a public hearing , he can &apos;t say without armed .

and the color pots and shattering , you may remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that wrote the field in the last year .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more worth building than it costs to build them .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this has been mentioned today .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
if you turn on the light , it looks like this . so just as we saw it before .
imagine the screen could just appear in different formats or size , in different solutions .
so i started thinking about what it &apos;s like to make these games together .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to reach the needle .
and what the marshmalware does is to identify them .
you do that because you can follow the white line of the road in the street , 92 .
i &apos;m convinced you &apos;re somehow moved to nostalgic thinking .
and what we can read almost every day in the daytime newspaper that you find in this third sentence .
one example of this from a very different area . monet has painted the seek x times .
and i want to give to protocol that i was here for my part of the jobs here .
this was our first attempt to start with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
but interestingly , the unique pitch of the love , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order of this information .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true today that it &apos;s less .
i thought , &quot; put the camera out , &quot; would mean that we wanted to do a backyard .
so for example , the number 164 sticks out of this code ; you can &apos;t see it .
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just so that architecture disappears almost .
if these dots fall down , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text .
our cities have been tested in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
for bonobos and people , life is not countless of teeth and silence alone .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this raw stuff like manifesto .
to become part of the constitution , but it has to be approved by the congress .
do you put an executive administrative administrator on the team , you &apos;re going to be more significant .
bill gross has several companies , among other companies , which is called esolar , which has great solar solar technologies .
one is the energy editors that create these technologies dramatically less than the power of power plants .
that means 15 pounds are needed to get a pound tuna to get tuna .
we just wanted to know what is , because with a normal , normal , electrochemical battery .
a television or a washing machine that you just use , which doesn &apos;t need you .
in a sense , the arctic ice sheet is the battle heart of our global climate system .
but the more i thought about it , the more i got to the view , the fish knows something .
and this was an example of what our own governments uses the technology against us , the citizens , the citizens .
we want to fight prevention and discrimination in the punishment system .
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually did .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
and what we &apos;ve actually done is we &apos;ve started humanity , we &apos;ve started to abstract .
this is because the government is like a ocean , and politics are the top 15m .
at the end of every day , i did a huge top soup that we shared .
something as profound as our identity is now a question of how this slide should show .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , so long they &apos;re not a particle physicists .
either &quot; flesh &quot; or &quot; a paradise &quot; , &quot; you &apos;re going to have the choice .
you can &apos;t just emphasize how critical this factor can be for the quality of a human being .
by shaking the sidewalk , and by the way , he can make the characters interact ...
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there were probably no men in their treatment .
i came to think of it as we got our send , and i got cameras out of it .
how can we keep them more fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three times fresh .
and by the way , the nearby gene rovers , which are virigious hormones .
i was the second volunteer volunteer at the brand , so i had a pretty good opportunity to get there .
and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution are slowly , but they &apos;re inexhaustible .
players love it , part of the misery of the missions of the missions of armatics .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are mastery players .
understand , there are two countries that control almost seven percent of the phosphorus benefits in the world .
in china , a news opponent today is still killing honey pots , kind of , right ?
it actually took some years to start with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
and the preparation were enormous . we had to build cameras and apparently and apparatus and build all kinds of things .
but what voodoo does so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
because obviously , an animal that has been very often , very often , very rarely before it dies .
and sometimes when something comes about ted , it gets a meaning and power that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have it .
you have to make the sound of the winds , you throw it away and read the rest of the book .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
they don &apos;t fight this fight that we all struggle to talk about who &apos;s allowed to talk ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
you might think that this is just a landscape of landscape , and the bottom part was manipulated .
and the next puzzle is about four women in three generations who are building together a new life .
the one on the left is jazz , and it &apos;s on the right , but you know what ?
just to give you a look , i zoom out , so you can see what you get .
and as part of it , they made us a concept of atoms .
or are we determined to be something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
i really hope that we play together to survive on this planet another century .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and seventh itself that can afford it .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as earlier .
the idea of this is obviously not just the machine services in the control room .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- has really been out of the socks .
these grass boxes don &apos;t walk with wind software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
now , when i was a nice college at college , i had my first biology courses .
and that &apos;s half of all the water problems that are caused by the textile industry .
this is almost complete safety -- possibly for fish , definitely for us , definitely for us .
in this country , there are children for lonely haidal punishment without punishment .
here &apos;s what we need to understand in terms of policing corners , again .
we &apos;ve got to prevent people who have long knowledge of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
that &apos;s the only thing that i do differently and beautiful ones , which is not that it &apos;s better handable .
now , reproductive produces all the rest of the limbs that have the numbers best .
his mother was inhabited as a punishment for -- to be a crime for crime .
it kind of made you find the time to find english and items .
two : famine in somalia . 3 : pfatty spray of police .
but it &apos;s not true , we have seven percent in europe , and our network is physically seen the european .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably most of america , most of the time , the publisher of children .
the next puzzle of the puzzle shows how a boat is running in the early mortgage in the early days .
this sounds very closely , and it sounds very like science fiction , i know .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
so , you &apos;re probably going to be , or you know , grizzles , fisheries , fisheries , a part of our future .
both of them are strong fuels , because we don &apos;t really think about the problem as we should .
on the new day , they &apos;ll get you to go -- woman &apos;s printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
but also , despite your logarithmic , it &apos;s lost on the left side of the left .
michael j. nelson from the mystery of science science theater was one of the first things that twitter made a joke .
so we also want to understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , very simple magic trick .
and so you can see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees celsius that they can survive there .
so , in the kind of shifting of resilience , they &apos;re experiencing the greatest gap .
today , more sophisticated in some flat lakes in alaska , even from the water itself .
for her life , she had made a job : the fluctuation of her family and a new life in australia .
and in reality , if we fail , if we escape to obstacles , we often feel different .
to this archaic model , we heard that we have a natural relationship to the virtual proportion .
as a child , i had collectors of stickers , stones , a box , a clunky and shame .
and so , from the interest in this technology , i just came up with this technology .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed an eight-belt package , which is at spaceship fluid .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not going to be open , but maybe you can help the france a little bit .
in high school , a student told me that brian goldman was going to learn for a flower .
i &apos;m going to come to a statistic of which i hope that most of you have heard before .
so if we look at the news , we prefer to be looking for negative news .
and as many people , i thought it was mainly about choosing people in a office .
so it &apos;s all the tools , and the only thing that mics us , is our imagination .
if someone asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , how would you be ?
so i &apos;m basically going to talk about this : if you look at something that &apos;s impossible , then you can do it .
because the lesson that i try to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let it go .
and maybe we don &apos;t know what wood we &apos;re made of when we &apos;re really dumped .
a third sentence , which immediately appears to people who have a strong sense of soul .
it &apos;s called the emphasis law or prevented psychology that actually affects us in perception .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re going to do next to the ownership of old age .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtual habitat as a real habitat .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
i can accelerate the whole sequence by draining the temple into one or the other direction .
and this question was so disturbing that we decided to go to the answer of the answer and sighty .
we say , &quot; computers , generates a hundred million random sequences of instructions .
so they make the methods that are easy to use , and they start with this patient , in the team of poor .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
so we might sell a shoe and it will be the greatest shoe you ever have .
why not have the fast muscle fibers that are going to allow them to run faster and longer ?
we know that we work as human beings , if we do hard , more important work .
we know from this study that you have to understand the needle when it &apos;s going to go to the thing .
i brought you an example of the north american tribe of nootubian india .
perhaps to an aging understanding of people &apos;s relationship between people and the mystery of creativity .
we now have almost an infinite choice of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve been achieved in the last century so that we can predict the development .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege of legitimizing , in front of adolescence .
so we could just end up with stupid , maybe hundreds of new cities .
when i went back to 27 years later , the fish was shrinking on half of its size .
well , morgan , in the name of transparency , this is what &apos;s going on with the $ 7100 ?
it &apos;s almost physiologically impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing light hoses .
do we use these decisions to form a society that &apos;s better , the successful is more successful , which is friendly ?
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your neighbors ?
this also shows the serendipity of this talk , so i hope i &apos;ll enjoy it .
but in fact , my research at the institute for the future , is exactly the opposite part .
there &apos;s nothing in my sleeve or coming out , no trickens , and you can study everything .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics that made me crazy at all were no fanatics .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of a column , often known as the migraine wave reactor .
i remembered myself last year when i got mosquitos and sort of liked the people .
so important for the age , the most important , the first semester , the great laws of law .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from this snow .
this is great . the tube didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly individual .
the viral particles were released by the cells , and then the cells came back and killed ecoli .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve got this point for a long time to improve our choice .
well , you see , all the cases , no one has to be an exceptional candidate .
most of the mass inheritance in this country , not really found in the class of violent crime .
this reference is going to be suggesting the money in more security scores and security .
police officers came up with a heritage and legishable lawyers and offices .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program that i could have ever write from hand .
so for me , it seemed to be more of photography , to be the right place at the right time .
and these sad forms really formed into a thought , which is that i just wish for one thing .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been for 500 years , for his time , as i have to say , very successful introduction .
you don &apos;t sit around and flip around . there &apos;s always some important thing to do .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we can keep from our experience is a story .
do you say that there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that make things different ?
this is sort of the deadline that tells us the environmental models that we need to hold .
and also the -- although it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need a fuel -- you have some of them .
you tell me that they don &apos;t bite . they actually don &apos;t even leave the glass .
so many people come in and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
she heard about this book from charles darwin , the emergence of species and the ancestry of people .
i promised my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , oma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
evolution is all about the continuum of the genome on the next generation , adaptation and survival generation after generation .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my physiotherapy .
well , if i had opened up the arrows with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
people believe in their faith , and that &apos;s how you can &apos;t free them .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design workshop .
there &apos;s a liquid guy that seems a little bit hard , but maybe they &apos;ll say this about us .
so here we see this again , again , again , again , again , every single aggregate .
translation : now interacting with the object , again , can zoom in , zoom in .
so , first of all , it sounds banal , but it &apos;s very exciting when you get closer to it .
because often people can do it , they can &apos;t make it friendly , so anyone can deal with it .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of scalgae and bogy .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace this , it will be a huge challenge .
if you break the gold glass glass so that everything is possible , it sends the happiness .
if i &apos;m in a room -- just like now , i don &apos;t know what you think about me .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to the court and carry this crazy case .
now , recently , a study was done with ceos that she was observed for a week the ceos .
so we &apos;re overwhelming our brains , because our brains are not very accepted that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
i received another gift , which is to see in the future , and to come back and live differently .
that means we have a common ancestor , a evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
and i said , &quot; excuse , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
so we have the memory itself , and the life itself , and they &apos;re really quite different .
unfortunately , that &apos;s the whole good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they have been mentioned a lot .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much energy in our energy without changing its lifestyle .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got two years later to face when we moved to california .
so , you need for the learning process of music language at least as long as the spoken language .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put these little pieces together , and we could correct the mistakes .
we &apos;ve done it to about a hundred genes of the 500 or 500 , which are here .
and this really reaches these ideas , these restrictions for the available space on the screen .
and it &apos;s detitive to think that our species may have existed for 60,000 years .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us out .
we &apos;ve developed an app for layar , expanded reality to find these eds .
and by the way , there &apos;s a corner of which i &apos;m going to tell you about , which works on the wireless .
we use this great euphemism , try and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that have been happening since the beginning .
so if you &apos;re lucky to do the happiness of the two types of self , you want to do very different things at the end of the day .
as peter told us , not only did they produce the highest doors , but also the most interesting structures of all .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a tape record .
we hope that this is no pop-ups and other nonsense -- that should not be necessary .
the grandfather of the man was not afraid of the arctic night , or the weather storm .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on the planet .
and to win , this has to be a better diagnosis than a team of high-quality doctors .
the founding fathers were activated from my view of the original atoms , and that &apos;s why .
they played a game game , and they had the victims to break up an epic adventure .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , which are success of scientific method .
and that would have been a lot more important , but it makes it so much more important .
i certainly would never reach an alien world with a spaceship ship , which seemed quite unlikely to me .
we &apos;re not going to answer it immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
well , just to conclude , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
who knows when the movie comes out , we might look like a horror volcano .
what are we going to do with the fact that we &apos;re just disturbing ourselves by a few nuotides ?
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then raise my strength and turn it off .
but if you &apos;re in an epic adventure , and you &apos;re told , &quot; we &apos;re going to get the oil out . &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would never have before available human potential to do it .
and that gets worse , and quite soon , kids will die back to it , because that &apos;s just one question of the numbers .
in the rich world , the millions of diseases that have not yet threatened us from one generation .
here &apos;s a very fundamental service . is there a light at home so that you can read the homework tasks ?
the greeks called these divine diets of creativity .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see how it &apos;s going to be taken into the next century .
so we &apos;re going to install a evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going on in the micro-second area .
so in other words , the future is around a year since i &apos;m on this world .
they shoot the decision -- shoot them on their own , even when it comes to their own best interest .
so these things are -- you know , people are reminding people -- this is kind of , why we &apos;re interested .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , you won &apos;t just understand it , you &apos;re also going to appreciate it .
recently , i talked to the tragedy industry , and they said they had this model right .
one method that is particularly interesting is , and what i &apos;ve been using a lot of time , is evolution itself .
we had a team of rocks in boston for the code for programs .
so , imagine if you were at the same time of several places , how would that feel ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
so the nerve cells are the information processing , the cellular communities that have built these cells .
so , it was possible for us to connect the little digital jumb with the rotorial controlling .
eacea , a small antioxium , which helps them to jump on the springs .
no , the gap i &apos;m talking about , which has to do with it , is to fake yourself .
if professors are going to be curious , they &apos;re often sweeping up in such a research mester .
this is what happens to the machine age , and it &apos;s the book , and it &apos;s happened , and it &apos;s the photoolic gray .
and it &apos;s about playing with a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first generation of the fourth generation , and this is about 18 months .
it turned out that it was actually meant to be meaningful , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do anything with your film . &quot;
in the moment , it was like a film director would have landed a time-shift .
that &apos;s how if i would say , take your child , just three times more than five times .
and the main lesson we &apos;ve learned , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
but there &apos;s no promise we can look at where you learn how to make fire .
his may be to write the piece of writing , will always be more and more and more to my personal , play .
but these concepts of the cyberage age that bring us back to these possibilities again to rediscover our skills .
so this is how they survive longer , and they decrease themselves in size .
and then we just then get these words that we use in the language of political correctly over again .
the first example is about what many of you know , and some of you estimate , very few of them don &apos;t need at all .
instead , they go to the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; we could do a or we could do b .
i want to explain to you with this mechanism today , or to explain something that is unfamiliar to you , which is unfamiliar with you .
so , i &apos;m here before one of my favorite images , harvesting tears from the shakets in the dump .
but here &apos;s the thing : if you have to get the evidence you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
in openness , for example , in the households , in the household of the tip of the garbage of wind between wind .
but again , and again , very rarely , something special happened . one of the manufacturers was actually overwhelmed in the world .
my heart was my heart , and i was very delighted while i was trying to summarize what was going on to me .
the human part of this bug , the end , of course , is that , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in .
immediately you &apos;re going to be able to give you an idea for those of you who are predicted , you can &apos;t know that .
they have recreated the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that &apos;s going to be changed a lot of the biology .
and because you are obsessed with your mind . how can you get hurt ?
for these non-engineers , littings became another material , electronics was just another material .
so what can be three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the human community ?
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is inherent , but also very time-consumed .
and every time it divided , the findings have distributed in the same amount of chemicals .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a realistic outcome .
so i wanted to create something else , something that begins with the process when the trigger is cut away .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you put it on the trigger .
and yet my interest in photography , when i received my first digital camera , at age 15 .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , these black object that you see .
i don &apos;t want this thing to breathe in 20 parts , as you know it from documentaries .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time in my life trying to be myself , and to adapt myself at the same time .
but not only that -- and they connect with the universe and they sit out with the universe and other devices out there .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most urgent problems of the world .
there are so striking things like this whole genetically engineered plants on the checkers .
if anyone had built a 2.5 inches of high construction , he would have put the price home .
i met mr in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney hall .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far can you take a piece of future .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really would go back into circles .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated when i &apos;m going to go to the gang .
you can go and create your own museum -- from all these images , you can put your own collection .
so , in the big and all of us , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have what the goal is .
well , it &apos;s a lighter for ordinary things that you find because you &apos;ve dropped it somewhere .
so the idea is that we actually include people with people , where they do things together , collective .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the ceo of the development department of a nonprofit organization called robin .

today , you can have a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome to a price of about $ 20,000 and in about a week .
i came to the realization that i was working on a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not inevitable , just different .
and you know what ? when i say that , people write me and they say , &quot; what do you care about it ? let people do what you want to do .
because , as i said in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it , and also no chance to actually form it .
and even if the answer to the question is no , &quot; is it certainly will have been the experience of the balloon of your child in a very different way .
they have a strange language , and they &apos;re called the linguistic lamie exam : you have to marry someone who &apos;s talking about another language .
unlike the old-class , middle-class subsidies , whose existence was completely unknown to me , there was no more sophisticated thinking .
and gary said that he would be willing to be all the people in this audience in this audience to provide a single adolescence of the most beautiful street in the world .
so , i really got my interest , and we started working with it , almost about the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
some people like to give up and give them a clear to the bitter end , as others don &apos;t think about it , and put it into a dramatic passion .
of course , the problem is that , as well as we start to look at all the common insights , we need to start to ask , why do we think about certain distances .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in vaccine with vaccine vaccine that has been built into the cells of a taboo plant .
we have a comic . we have &quot; high level &quot; for regional understanding , knowledge , sustainability , vision , vision and falling .
so if we look at the development of our society , right here , we &apos;re now moving from the third into the fourth generation or social generation .
i know , and i &apos;m sure that they do the job , because they come from a series of hundreds of thousands of programs that have done the job .
and finally , he says , &quot; can you look , you can just open all the doors in your house , and you see very loudly music , and see if the livestock is ? &quot;
in the other hand , i was involved in unsafe life , the tragedy of the violence of violence , the drug abuse and the isolation .
when we put it up , the lights were looking at and the box were looking in , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece of cake .
the founding fathers returned this idea , and they put it through a new nuclear concept , and this concept said that all humans were created equally .
there &apos;s a scholarship called wolf , and it &apos;s said to him , sometimes wolf says , there &apos;s no freedom of freedom .
that means , from the local village , actually , a global village has become the same principles , of course , intuitive intuitive , but also the total transparency .
and the reason that i felt worse was , with all these available opportunities , my expectations for what a good couple of good jeans went up .
i sent some facebook news messages , some twitter news messages , and i gave people the opportunity to stand on my tedtalk at ted2011 .
and maybe we can do it , widesperate as something natural , mimimic and feel useful , and we don &apos;t feel that much about their presence .
i say that i &apos;m making my wrist around making sure that nothing disappeared in my sleeve or comes out , and that &apos;s a lie .
because we &apos;ve been working with only 10 to 12 people who &apos;ve been working together for years , sometimes we were two to three months .
and now you can just , if you want to do anything , if you want to test anything , and especially when you want to make people happy , to practice that gap .
remember , as carl sagan , the voyager-spacecraft , in 1990 , when it moved back to saturn , turn back to the earth ?
and then my friends say , the little tease movies , &quot; well , how do we deal with these big , giant hollywood fills ? &quot;
and what she proved was a anatomic concept , and she put it through another one that was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you see in italy , how people in the high bow are so high boadoses of the car out of the car .
a country has already offered its supreme court to provide as a court for the goods of the villagers .
and i was amazed to reject resistance on what is the most effective thing in health care in human history .
i spend most of my time with the social weakness in the social settlements and places where there are a lot of hopeless .
and this is not bad for a project where almost every advertising agency that we talked about , the clients that we have to recommend the finger .
they were kidding the game , and they decided that anatomically , that anatomically , the common denominations , not the differences . and that was very radical .
and in the end , we &apos;re really in front of a choice . do we want to live in a monopography world of monotony , or in a big polymatic diversity of the world ?
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal , this piece of quantum mechanical mechanical mechanical , we had to send out the whole line .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , it &apos;s the highest , isn &apos;t it ?
we &apos;ve been digitized to 20 years , and as we sequenced the humanitarian genome , we &apos;ve sequenced the whole shift from the analog world of biology to the digital computer .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be very full of pneumonia if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence is one of them .
so , to buy new jeans after many years of trading , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
in order to give you a sense of sensing a sense , of course , i had to say something about this remarkable belief of the doun and voodoo is not a cult of the black magic .
and because none of us is more important than our survival , the first part of all the information is part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
and the incredible thing to me is that the projects that i got most of which i got , or where i had the biggest success , are those who i interacted with things directly .
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend a lot of time trying to imagine this , because , if you imagine all the time , you won &apos;t listen to me .
you &apos;ve got to separate two things out : to be a medical fact , to be amputated , and to the other social opinion , whether i &apos;m not disabled or not .
the crux of this company was , the analogy , the analogy processes to overwhelmed with optical prints , and begin to start with digital production .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to get the users about a useless -- how we &apos;ve seen it in stages .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable variable , which is a reminder of self from a living self , and time has very little influence on this story .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people will fill the system with life , and if that &apos;s what people do , then people also make mistakes of time .
and it &apos;s going to allow people to measure their blood pressure from home to their blood pressure to send it to their doctor , and for example , to share it with other parts , for something more than 100 dollars .
so the first case is , all the atoms of atoms are made of the piece of metal , and they &apos;re still moving at the same time and the same atoms are heading up and down .
if i think about creating overflow , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury on this planet , it &apos;s about creating a life full of possibilities .
but the latest evidence of dna shows that the etrine , later , the rooted realm , the same dna as the old lyrics .
how do you increase happiness is very different from how you think and whether you think about memory , or whether you think about life itself , or whether you think of life itself .
but if you &apos;ve got very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a column -- you &apos;re going to dig it without the whole complex .
we &apos;re going to turn it off , and we &apos;re expecting the first data in june or juli , and put our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
we want the world of creation , the inventors , the inventors , the co-encouraging , because this world that we live in , these interactive world , belonging us .
imagine this device in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the health care .
so i decided to visit one day to visit the filiters , and i asked the head , &quot; this model , do you know , do you give people all these opportunities ? &quot;
the head of congress came to the stage and said , &quot; professor romer , thank you for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
we need to take these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time machine , and we will go to the future , we will be glad to do that .
so i stood back with a small team of unknown terrain , and we dreamed &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t even happen before .
and then we don &apos;t have the idea , but that &apos;s salary , i think , well , i think it &apos;s relatively well done , people are really convinced of this .
i mean , it can be strange to think about that one thing at the same time is two different places , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea , they evolved .
and sometimes a little prototype of all this experience , which takes us from &quot; uh-oh &quot; -- to take a ta-da moment .
but the measurements go back very well , and the people in my company told me that we were not able to be able to do that .
i was in the middle of 10 when i went back to one of his classes , and i played the last of the ballet store from the four balchin , a late piece of work .
if your work was a contest , you didn &apos;t look at everything for you , everyone knew you had this physical genius test that helped you .
in nine people that we have executed , one that we have for innocent debt , which has been disappointed and made out of death cell .
so an organism could learn how to learn a certain fruit not to eat , because they made it bad , and made it sick , the last time they ate it .
personally , it &apos;s easier to create a place as to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to go to compromise with the ideas in your head .
it &apos;s about how to engage people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media , and so they can create a peaceful experience .
finally , this elderly black man came with a very concerned face in the courtyard and sat behind me , almost on the defense bank .
there &apos;s this airplane in hundreds of thousands of parts that work together to make their flight . &apos; isn &apos;t it visible ? &quot;
one day -- this is a real report -- this came in : &quot; thylacine in my mosquitos . can &apos;t say if it &apos;s dead .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults wanted to know me , relaxed , she turned into a box of kite , and was put in my hands .
we &apos;re going to have a process that might require 100,000 years , and we can prioritize it at a thousand years -- and maybe even on the next 100 years .
there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst ones are frozen bones .
that means we &apos;re going to see our prosthetic before we see that back to the back of our device in the back of our seaw , to say , okay .
his job is to create the conditions that were less than a billionth of a billionth of the universe -- and to 600 million times a second .
but they also have a secret for our future , a future that we need to adapt to ourselves in increasingly greater challenges , by greater creativity and printing .
and a lot of discussions that i had in the last six years , were similar to the discussion i had in the last three years of photovoltaics .
a season , if you have the full power of water , the pressure has enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s about four to six square .
and what happened to me was something interesting about jacques cousteau , which was the idea of a whole unknown world here on our own earth .
and our european grid is basically just made of louder rotating masses of large power plants , wherever the wave goes around europe .
a process that everybody knows how everybody who has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , in fact , everybody here -- not always be reasonable .
and every year we ask the students to create companies and services and services that can live within a decade of a decade of millennium of people &apos;s lives .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i believe that many of you have understood that the moral peniciling of the universe is far , but it &apos;s about justice .
and finally , saturday , a unique thing to develop , personal style , is a great way to tell a world about a world without saying a word .
they didn &apos;t count , because he was located with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had to keep .
i think that the molecular biology now , in general , is general , biotechnology , everything you count to do , synthetic biology and so on .
what would it be like to give the oppressed , where are you going to have a voice to focus on attention and make change , for the first time ?
i love to find a different opportunity to find a different colorful , crazy outfit , to wear , and to photograph in the last time and to photograph .
i told my wife , whenever a human being used to be a moral law , because we should try to replace it by replacing the literally .
and it turns out that if you do it , it feels something concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool for people to save more .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for making people we love to preserve sales , but to prepare them to do well .
so we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , producing a sequence of daughters , and producing something very complicated in the heads of others .
no , it just looks a lot better if we show that we &apos;re all the time to get the dangers , the other ones , if they just lay fire .
now , in egypt , in egypt , the perpetrator in april in april 2011 , the main source of the egyptian police intelligence , and they found a lot of actors .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of programmable work , numerous , numerous parties and scores , tony &apos;s first time after seven years .
so this is what this reactor was a problem , which is what we fill in our fill , and that &apos;s where the volume is reduced during this process .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we have the biology digital , and now we &apos;re trying to create the digital code in a new phase of biology by building new lives and building new lives .
but this is where i &apos;m holding at night -- one of the things that kept me at night , and we &apos;ve never had scientific progress in the same way that we &apos;ve never had before .
now , according to burger , the premier in january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls from this film .
yes , this is a huge debate right now , at the moment of building the coal force , because we don &apos;t know , or gather , because that &apos;s not what we &apos;re doing .
a lot of our friends thought that we were beautiful about doing that , and that we were going back and we were all going back to the walls and the walls would be the graffiti ones .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst errors only happened in the first five years of passive , but what i would argue is a lot of my colleagues .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government , the control and the services .
and when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very exclusive grove of life , at least , at the time , he was really exclusive .
in a country that &apos;s just a yearning crisis behind the crisis , in congress , was voted to be elected with 124 voice .
it seems like we were right away from the other parts of the building , but in fact , most part , the basic mechanisms of our cells are pretty much the same .
but the logic of deception allows us to do it as if the first sentence would have to be wrong as if you had to adopt the opposite without evidence .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert that if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been working in a long time to experience how new it is .
and it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing , you &apos;re going to hear it like this . &quot;
now , there are verbs and dignity and remarkable marks , these things that come and go , but they played a formula , marke is a pretty strong thing .
and if you &apos;ve been given that the drugs of stages are complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the data is an science for itself .
if i tell you that somebody &apos;s life as an eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self .
now , i did a couple of people in the company , and no one could give me an entry answer , until finally , i got to the cake biologists .
basically , you get every round of any sidewalks in any sidewalk , and as you try to form words , these words are tested over a dictionary .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine where i feel a little bit more well-being , or maybe a little less likely to talk to you about it .
but then another , very interesting step , where things became completely different , and that started to communicate , and that information came out , so that communities came from cells .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , we say , climate .
they &apos;re staring out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything they see is fluid , and these density , margins .
we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these design components are the design of the future .
ladies and gentlemen , which gives me enormous trust in our future , is the fact that we have more power today than individuals to provide us the great challenges of our planet .
so a app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spread from rare , it &apos;s a kind of a sling on the government of government .
what that means is that if you were to meet someone , and you would tell them , oh , his father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about his size ?
at this point , and if you laugh , you &apos;ll see how important this gap is , and how much time you need to experience something that artists can share with us very well .
how would it feel to live in a world where the german was leaving people , especially if there were a lot of people who were a lot of jewish people .
and because the government ultimately determines the power of us -- remember , he remembers you , &quot; we &apos;re going to change the people ? &quot; -- how do we think about it , how this change is happening .
are they reliable , stable , obesity , industry , sadness , sacred , holy , assess , and how the dalai lama or yoda ?
this is ayahuca , who &apos;s heard of many of you have heard , the most powerful psychotic prey from the repertoire of the scottish .
and very often , i &apos;ve worked with sexual people , whose gender atypically is -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female guys .
that &apos;s what we had to do at the time . when we took kids a book , we took the description of the eye , and we proposed them to the canvas in our heads .
we came to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email , which was that nathaniel was interested in training for me .
and since we &apos;re giving ourselves the median media campus , for example , the virtual reality in our v.r.r. lab , we can actually do it all the time .
i said , &quot; well , listen , you know , you know , and i both know , if this book is not brilled , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because it makes a lot of sense as much as anything i heard about when it was about to explain the most crazy thing of creative process .
so it &apos;s so far . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever went to 27 -- in the diameter .
and i argued that we might be able to create a new form of cambrian explosion in which there might be massive new technology based on this digital design .
the reason that was better than anything was worse than everything was worse when everything was bad , it was possible for people to make sense of the experience .
and i was talking to me that if i had my efforts to double the perfect error , and never again , that the voice could be distorted .
so these are just a few of the clips that i collected over the last six months -- but it would have been the last six days , or the last six years .
and as i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i had several months to plan them to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzles .
but also , it turns out , because it turns out we &apos;re using this whole time to actually change what we &apos;re doing to people .
i can tell you today the notions that the bach had , the bach has to sound on the modern wing , which can &apos;t be a bc bc balcono .
already from the english german to english , more knowledge can be forgotten , if you &apos;re going to get it out of it , or even if you &apos;re about poetry .
bg : well , we need one of these scalable , generous things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then take 20 years .
if you &apos;re also playing , you &apos;ll see some nuances here that are zoomed up , and the mouth of the mouth is a optimism of optimism , and the eyebrows are surprising .
you have to imagine that if you &apos;re doing something of the classic soundscape , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software only one hour .
i &apos;m a wall , and i have to work every day , i have to stand up to the same time and swim , and i &apos;m really excited about uncomfortable .
so they found , according to heresotus , the spiritual game and agreed a national strategy , and on a day you would eat . the next day you would play .
the other note is that we use the zero-sum emissions , whether it &apos;s used in all countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
and the film studio , i sold this as &quot; romeo and julia on a ship , &quot; it became a well-known film , it was a passionate movie .
now , in discussions , this insulin , that insulin , is going to go around , who have a little network that has to do with our interconnectivity and nothing .
and so we decided to build a half-berlin in berlin , which is kind of the electric facility that we can form at the same time in the scale .
this is called the interpret to interpret this impairment of the emergency language in a different language , namely concrete , non-verbal language .
now , the intuitive user is not just a major economic factor , which is a basic economic factor , if i just want to make technological devices .
a lot of journalists asked me with the question , &quot; what are they going to do , who digest us , whether caster segment or male ? &quot;
now , what i &apos;m hearing is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monomonoculture , we don &apos;t want a huge fields with one thing that &apos;s wrong .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them to play some kind of game together to control their health better .
and imagine , i &apos;ve actually got five year-old child with dr. p.m. , and this is how they &apos;re trying to stop this practice , natural success .
bg : well , the actual spending on research -- say , we should spend the u.s. 10 billion a year more than they do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us go and interact , and the unexpected linking we are , the real nutrients of creativity .
and since there was no video games there , there was no way of filtering with computer generating the whole imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
as you knew in the village at the time , who has what happened to whom and when , when that &apos;s what &apos;s happening today about this extension of our self through these mobile devices on global level .
maybe i wanted to succeed so successful and be able to take responsibility that i would be so handle , and so i would be able to do it for my patients without having to contaminate it .
i got a punch box , because i &apos;m not on the bike path , but there &apos;s often a disabled that doesn &apos;t leave you on the wheel .
and so i &apos;m looking at one of the people in common with most other experimental quantum physicians who need a good logic to put the complex ideas together .
if we look at one of the green fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream of a solution .
jacques cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating sensation that gave us animals and places and a world full of wonder that we never had before .
and of course , if we can do it , of course , for us , for nike , for snike and mauritz and all the textile industry .
in each step , we produced these pieces in the translate so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process of what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
unlike the impact of the 20th century , the participation of the community is the part of the community to be part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or making something new .
my wife , my kids , and i moved to the garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspirations and archives have taken our house .
we can go out a step further , and then review the data , and see that circular disease and cancer is susceptible , but not for everyone .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the hot fish , the lake , the lake , heavy fish , they &apos;re collapsed .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has doubled more than doubled on the infant average income of the world &apos;s population has tripled .
one of the areas that we see in the beijing , in our culture today , in the united states today , are the fighting over the beginning and the end of life .
now , this is good , besides that paul &apos;s walking around and talking about vaccines and says , how valuable they are , and that people should just stop bending jamas .
the second fatty is a form of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s between his life , and his happy life , or happy with his life .
you &apos;re going to go into these capsules , you &apos;re floating into these dark , hostile environment , where there &apos;s no hope for rescue , if you don &apos;t make it back .
so from that , you also notice that there &apos;s a change in there , and it &apos;s only to get away from that absence , which is a hundred percent renewable .
it was prioritized in the cell and recognized the other chromosome as the strangled material , and so we had one cell with a new chromosome .
and these scientists have just documented the different subjects with which these ceo are busy , and how much time they make decisions to make decisions with the issues .
everybody thinking , i &apos;m going to go between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have walked somewhere on a towel somewhere on the beach .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and i want to do it , because that story , like romantic , is always rich .
my first memories are from this boat -- the steady tup of the motors , the claws of a wave on the bug , the bug and the horizon .
and if you manipulate the speed of this root , then you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor , and finally , to explode the census .
it &apos;s the living self , the doctor , the doctor , you know , if the doctor asks , &quot; does it hurt now if i grab you here ? &quot;
now , if we go further and go to age age , we say , 40 years or younger , we see that accidents should even worry about the challenge that people should worry about .
we should call them what they &apos;re called , a commercial in absence , a commercial capital , rising the ecological capital that makes that same production .
we can look at whether we can use reducing carbon footprint that could be used to produce productivity , convert co2 to drive this process .
so when i started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
if people were to take this seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything on their head , everything we believe , for example , in controlling control and so on .
it depends on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two columns , and that &apos;s how the opposite of the sentence was already proved and predicted .
but in the mid- &apos; 90s , we realized that we were founded in the creaters -- and design design -- where we had actually founded the company .
it looks like who doesn &apos;t have a freedom of liberty , can &apos;t be moved for his actions and responsibility to be moved to the main responsibility , and so he is unable to compute .
because i &apos;m going to have more life expectancy than today , and that &apos;s why my palette is going to have a lot more carbon than today .
it &apos;s also in such an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , electronics , and combined it in a pretty elaborate way .
and i learned that the world &apos;s deep sea , even in the flat oceans , so fascinating in life , is how we can really imagine it .
and then the scale of the semantic connection , and the filters that come out of it , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic networking network .
i recently did a question with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that made a typical americans on a day is 70 .
a couple of weeks later , the firefighters gave a letter to the households where they used to rescue for the takeoff of their house .
the food that was fed by a chef or a chef , has to be carried out , and not just cheated or receptor .
you should be talking about these innovation strategy , and they would be smiled by the ridiculous funds that will be expressed for those innovations .
and if you want to go over 20 percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn the oil off .
and then we took a d.c. burning of burning and put the burn into the laser , and then we tried to focus on this camera .
of course , the chance of election is very small , very small , that they &apos;re actually coincidentally incarcerated , so i don &apos;t actually make any structions .
that means that instead of remembering us individually , we have standardized , widesired patterns of memory that we can relate to our personal memories .
and yet , the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , which is remarkable clean coal technology that you see here .
so that &apos;s what i sent them home , i missed a voice in me who tried to say to me , &quot; gold , you don &apos;t do a good idea . &quot;
what do you think of the average performance for a cardiologist or a nurse or a nurse that should be a leader , a rescue ?
this is a people who are not cognitive between the blue colors and the green , because the hive of the sky depends on the forest , which is equal to the people .
and my love to science fiction appeared in my environment , because in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and the deep sea .
we see many , many gigabytes of digital photos here , who are going to go down and continue to recover and reproduce , in any way , in any way , can rearrange .
this tribe , which is the codes , 17 variants have shown in ayahuca , which you can see all of them in the forest in the forest that seems to be a way of our eyes .
and i was confused , because i thought , you know , the whole concept of advertising , is to present your product as many people as possible , as many people as possible .

and we started making pieces , starting with stages of stages -- the fifth until seventy-seventh letters , which led to make these 24,00,000-letter pieces to put them back together to 27,000 .
they enable us to tell the story of the neuromarketing , as we tell the story in this movie , that today you use mris mris to make the ludge of the brain , both advertising and films .
so i started thinking about this , and so i think , with the safety of security in the past months , while i was working on the book , that &apos;s going to seem soon -- as the dangerous , fearful , expectations of my conclusion of success .
and in my profession , rose in rose as well as my family , as a volunteer man , i am a witness of generosity and kindness and kindness , but i also see the most important love of love and mutts of individuals .
suppose they were living in a particular remote area , and they have a lovely people with distorted heart vessels , and their home physician , to a cardiologist , whose average performance is in 200 attitudes .
but when i was working with him , and i asked him why he did this intervention -- it was high rising operations -- his answer was that , in his country , these kids would be treated very bad kids , and so he had to do it .
and of course , when it &apos;s also a little bit intuitive , and how can i take age as an age and create the things so that they use it to create a friendly , so they &apos;re intuitively intuitive , because then they &apos;re fun , and they &apos;re just too simple .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those who make errors and those who don &apos;t make them , those who don &apos;t make the sleep , and the ones without constraints , and the results with bad results and the good results .
it &apos;s also got three big problems . the cost , especially in high-regulation countries , and the question of security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human work that the fuel is not used to be used for weapons .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid of a real gasses , and it keeps millions of people from the bloom .
now , to decide not to buy a glass board , it &apos;s probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our silence -- but it turns out that the decision-making problem is that the decision problem also affects us with very much consequence .
i don &apos;t have to adjust that emotionally , because in the same way , the corner is always going to be a different crazy , colorful , colorful outcome , just waiting for me to wait , if i have a little bit of love in the heart , and it &apos;s going to have it .
so that &apos;s one effect . the other effect is that even if we make the paralysis and we make a decision less happy with the outcome of choice , as if we had the opportunity to decide the opportunity to choose between ourselves .
this is a photograph that i took on the northern baffs of the baffin islands , when i went to the inuguard to the nasty narjagd , and this man , aolya , told me a wonderful story of his father .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyrannei of the memory itself , and you can think of the memory itself as a kind of a life that takes the living self through experience that doesn &apos;t need living self .
i mean , if i &apos;m in the room alone , i do all kinds of strange things , but then other people go up and i listen to all these things because i don &apos;t want to leave them with it , or frankly , they &apos;re going to disappear .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to do abundant and use less , but the average number is going to increase this number every year , and so it &apos;s going to double as a double , which is the number of services per person will be provided .
i met these guys from grail , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to promote a light on any surface and then draw with a laser on the surface of the earth .
so what that means is that when we look back to what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space of humans in evolution , and particularly we look at the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
so there are big prices here . there are challenges in transmission . if we say that the energy outside is outside of the country , it &apos;s not just the technology that you have to deal with the risk that energy comes from anywhere else .
but , as we think , the only way we think of biology is a big impact on the cost of the cost of food , or the limitations of its availability , if we look at co2 as a farming material , and so we &apos;re going to go to these cells .
i started working with working on scientific literature , about how these centuries are built in nates and found out that they &apos;re structured in so-called cackage , and each of which includes 164 centrifuge .
now the fascinating thing is that the betape of tape , which are confined in the liane , mao inhibitors are exactly the kind of thing that &apos;s necessary to enable the tamins . so you ask yourself .
this is a problem , because the global warming frogs around the arctic ocean , where there are huge amounts of frozen carbon , which , when it comes to micromethane .
and what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of the attack was actually , it was actually slow to make it slow down and incurately -- obviously in the attempt to try to get engineers desperate , so they wouldn &apos;t be able to get behind it .
so maybe even german of this technological change , because the more you think there &apos;s always a different truth , which is that every person who has something special , and it can be very powerful and that the human ability to adapt to us is our biggest .
my good friend ray short-term has shown us that every tool that is going to be the information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , makes it big , and the price of prioritizing every 12 months to 24 months .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as international group , as we &apos;ve become aware of ourselves , o.k , there &apos;s now us as a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people that are always there and so on .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say to your parents that you &apos;d never walk , and never be as moving as other kids , or that you could never have a independent life test , and you &apos;ve just listed me since then . &quot;
what if we could rotate this situation and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going from one to the other , we can start to go from many things to many things , and by seeing patterns that would be located ?
this is what we feel so guilty about the earth , that we say , there &apos;s no biodiversity , no bioluminescent , no bioluminescence , no formula , and as they all call the hot ones that allow our own excreations to go back .
i fell in love with the evolution of evolution , and i found something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in individual organisms , divided every cell , and all of the genetic information will continue to get rid of the cells in both dead cells .
this was worth what i was doing for all this year in the clean space , because , you check the mask , the massmic difference between one single atom and the metal piece of metal is about the difference between the metal and all of them .
and then i got to the six-legged nevertheless , and then we got together with friends , and i became a co-founder of the company , and then i got together with the trajectory of a number of cellular manufacturers in the world .
at the time , it was just a monkey , where the skull , the skull , and others have said , &quot; actually , if you &apos;re going to read the people who want to read the people , then they want to talk about it , and that &apos;s totally fine .
now , if a visual writer in spain does something impossible , something magical did : allah , allah , olfrih , allah , great , great , brown faculty , it &apos;s a glimpse of god .
so what happens in &quot; the whole thing about what happens to you , &quot; is that everything from the top up to the bottom , from the beginning to the end , is totally marked by the title -- the sponsor you &apos;re going to see in the movie , which is the marx .
and the message is now , we have to get to these rotating mats , if we kind of increase our goals , 20 percent , 20 percent , 20 percent , three , three percent , three percent , and so on , if we want to reach out at all .
and then you &apos;ve got over a three-month period of time with a rich note called &quot; the note note &quot; -- it &apos;s been told to tell you that you were very smart , and after those three months , you &apos;ve actually written them .
this is what i did -- what i did is i took this code -- which is the code of normal letter , which we use symbolic -- and i wrote my visitor map on a dna piece of dna , and it wrote about 10 times .
and i &apos;m going to ask myself , how much his vision of me as a startling and powerful girl , and he made my own picture of self-assembly , and i was able to think of myself as one of nature , a powerful , powerful , powerful and powerful human being .
and there you can also be acquired by my general doctor , so that he can see where my weight is , and not just in the moment that i need to support poets or cardiology , but also with a view of the past .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early &apos; 80s , when i was starting to start with the elementary school , and so my image started to build out of my family and shape , in terms of other kids and the rest of the world .
it &apos;s a picture of the first punishment particles that put the entire track of the lhc back to the lhc , and then abandoned a part of the lhc to make a rain of the detector on the detector .
he got 400,000 of his people , because he was there , that red beef , bone marrow and shape-based oil is much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can get lost on aids .
and finally , i believe that even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so inspiring , we &apos;re not going to be measured at the end of our technology , not the things that we develop , not in our own minds and our minds .
what i do instead , and what the designers are doing , is we think , we &apos;re thinking about a certain abstract device , these machine , and the machine is doing something that makes our skills far better , and faster than we could ever do it .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , developers and architects , even with ctos , and there &apos;s something about this task , which is the deep thing in nature , and i want to share some of them with you .
and there you can see that we have seven senses , most of us , we have only five , now , in fact , seven of course , there &apos;s probably seven in the future , coming back to the next point , and as we expand again .
what you have to do there is , maybe it &apos;s easy , but that &apos;s not what you have to do . you have to get all the co2 that comes out of the burning of the box , put it in pressure , and then you hope somewhere , and then you want it to stay there .
and as a miracle took his mind , and began to play out some of the pitches of inconcerts , and then asked me to play them , like , delhi , sanctui , lifi , lifus .
i committed to the place and to his brother and his father -- his father , &quot; well , my proposal is , tony &apos;s proposal : tony &apos;s going to talk , we &apos;ll get to him a device , and we &apos;ll find a way to do his art again .
now i have to stand up , when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex , sex / sex , death -- it seemed quite reasonable to do it , but with every year , it had to come to my second fence .
i &apos;ve studied historians in this case , and in this case , i study how people went around anatomy -- human body , animal bodies -- how they went to fluid fluids , with body concepts , how they thought about bodies .
because i don &apos;t care whether it &apos;s the ministry of health , who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my mammography , &quot; or any cancer jellyfish , who wants to treat his patients with caffs .
so now , if i do this , the profiles on the ground , then collect some samples , and then make these kinds of samples , and then they can turn this method to , and then they say , okay , this hair belong to this person , so .
he contains the dog and improvised an irony , which took the skeleton of the dog and improved a bad dog , created a different dog , and he was swinging over the ice shepherd with the pounding knife .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- is it grew up or sizable twins , whether it &apos;s interior sexual surgeons -- are often adapted to the norm , is not because it would be a physical advantage of their physical health .
because ... at the end of the day , it &apos;s followed . centuries ago , in the north of north america , people seem to have died with holy fears and music collecting music that have been held for hours -- to the mornings .
so i also wrote an article about it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought it was &quot; frankenstein , &quot; why they believed that molecules were going to take a certain kind of randomly available access to nature .
and then the next one that has already been done with neo-neural model , or mental model , like the software literature , is that you would have an idea of doing something , the metaphor of a desktop , to make the computer usable .
the mind can be recommended by the great water , responding to the rhythm of the tangible , to overcome the soul of the living , so that the olyth century is going to be a brief moment to god .
it was on a piano search for music students in my loved teacher , professor julie , a famous beethoven specialist , consequently , concertified professor and slow professor at high school in high school .
but this is so my prototype , which has been seen , but it &apos;s kind of going on , so on a thing , the thing on , on electronics and pressure , and that was the pressure was too high , that was broken .
we took a ps3-camera , we built them out , we put them on a leather light , and now we &apos;ve got a device that &apos;s available -- you can build it yourself , we can make the code that you can download the software .
we &apos;re looking into this web , and we &apos;re seeing the fifth hertz , and if it &apos;s going to get nine commodity herds , we &apos;re going to start to do some valves , then we &apos;re going to go back to a bible , we &apos;re going to get back up again .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design a year and take a year off and work in a environment , which is pretty much everything that they really hate , we actually have them working in the government .
in which we did this simple thing , there was a increase in the participation of 20 percent , and there was a rise of the number of people who were ready to save or a climb to watch four percent of the savings they were ready to pay for the savings .
there &apos;s a way that the neanderthals were 60,000 years ago , 60,000 years ago , people with severe body injury injury , and that might have happened , because the life experience of life in the survival of these people was valuable : valuable .
now we have &quot; three vertical &quot; laws , &quot; which bring people to the people behind the grid , for a bicycle theft , for the pile of stations , that instead of giving them the things to the opaque .
the idea is , again , imagine that we &apos;re going to do that again with people to do something and change the environment -- almost as we call it clouds , how to build a design movement , but with a cloud .
and yeah , so , you know , it &apos;s relatively heteroterogeneous , so that &apos;s the sales of people who are doing the home , all the way to bigger organizations , so that they &apos;re doing more times more in institutional form .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because we &apos;re going to do our science in the field of nuclear power , that we &apos;re going to achieve a point where we have to admit that democracy is going to be based on anatomy ?
i graduated , and i hope that the video works , a very nice project , which is the bachelor &apos;s work of michael burqa , anesthesia , joris and janitor mordiz .
and it &apos;s getting better , the things that you do for , and i &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars -- gps , gps video , video and books , full of books , full of music , technology , technology , the medical diagnostics -- are literally getting tangible and cell phone in your cell phone .
heinrich , because you take that he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s on the xy -- you can take that male , he can now be raised , what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry .
and finally , a result of the buy a bad seat if there &apos;s only one way to buy that if you &apos;re unsatisfied , and you wonder why who is responsible , the answer is clear . what can you do ?
&quot; as we were fighting in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted to fix everything , but what we needed most was hope , a mental orientation , the skills , sometimes to be hopeless , and to be the legislation . &quot;
so here you have this censorship between the unconscious and the conscious , which is immediately , without you can do something about it , and the things you know that you look very differently , so that you can make a lot better for you and others .
because i think that the interactive media in our archaic , cognitive models , so patterns that have been programmed in our biological memory , have been programmed very long , and that we can just come back through the interactive media .
afterwards , the old tyrannical civilization that has the caribbean coastal coastal coastal coastal covers and then moved to the top of the people in a volcanic channel that goes over the caribbean level .
and before the background , i was in the field of interface design , so the next generation of the human computer in the computer , so in the computer &apos;s relationship with the person &apos;s relationship , how our tools are , or how our computers changed from the computer &apos;s computer kisses to the digital assistant .
and i know that some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; if the world wouldn &apos;t be a better place , if we would all talk about language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s say , this new yoruba . let &apos;s be channels .
so , she goes to the house , and she &apos;s looking for the paper , and the poem goes through her , and she &apos;s going through a pen , and she &apos;s going through it , and then she said -- she said , it was as if she could put it on her hand and put it on the other hand .
i &apos;d like to take that contract seriously , i &apos;d be born in a world that somebody like me would perceive a person as a person who could live in their lives , and today , but i &apos;m going to have an opportunity for the odds and the chances that i &apos;ve experienced .
and that was the problem : transparency -- transparency of deception and deployment , just to discover and instantly , instantly , characterized by recognition and access to the information , especially what &apos;s going on , which is the last curriculum -- is certainly the biggest problem .
we have this living plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to do a rich hand , and i didn &apos;t want to do all the things that i wanted to flip around , all the experiences i wanted to do and never do .
if we change the plastics , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water storage , that you can go back to celluseum , then you can go back to a baby basis with a baby or in tunisia and 50 trees .
and it turns out that under a 60,000 dollars of income in the year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of american samples , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a 600,000 dollars a year .
i think it may be more clear to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome , but that we &apos;re open to be open to the poor , to the poor , to put a champion , to try to use a champion , and maybe even dance with it .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness -- the space of an enormous amount of rape , which has been performing for decades and so many lives as the first world war .
so , this whole discussion , as it &apos;s going to go right now -- and move forward , energy , like this , we have , for example , for the island , for five to three percent exceptions , so we tip the wind and the sun .
so we started with some volunteers who were starting to take us a little more than a year ago , helped in seattle , to label things that they would call them warm -- different kinds of things that you can see -- things that they would throw away .
tan le , anonymous , anonymous , ray of score , was now cool , refugee and social activist who was invited to places that they had never heard of , and in their own existence , they could never imagine .
they knew that every year about 75,000 hondurans left their country to go to the united states to the united states , and they wanted to know what to do to make sure that these people can stay in their country , and can do exactly the same thing in honduras .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally designed to be an italian , and every young in italy grows with this image in his room , but the reason why i &apos;m going to show you this is the formula in the last century , something very interesting happened .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermal sources , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that no one had ever seen before , no one had ever seen before , and for science at the time , when we saw them , we didn &apos;t even have words .
we think that smallpox -- we believe that smallpox is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website receives 35 million dollars every month .
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should share rights in terms of people , because i have to admit that i have to know a series of restorations that probably make social-life more likely than some people i know .
and this is what we have to see on millions of faces all over the world , if we can take the top of the century , and take the face of the attack , the face of all the drifts on the edge of a sudden .
in fact , what children &apos;s children do is they start building with the marshmallow and prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow , so that they have the opportunity to repair the opportunity to repair the bloodshed prototypes .
and then there &apos;s some things that are all done in the everyday life , which is what most people don &apos;t even know , for example , for example , the medicines that allow us to wash up with four degrees of wash , are also more optimistic .
and then they go to the consumer electronics business to put together a stereo store -- speaker , cd , a tape player , a tape radio , more powerful , and in this electronics , there &apos;s so many stereo business .
and i think that they were so strong and strong , and so radical , and so radical , where they were doing all of the things that i &apos;ve been looking at in the pocket of 1776 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
what we &apos;ve learned from cultural overwhelming studies , is that women , in average -- not every average , but in average -- are more complex social relationships , more complex social relationships and care for people who are in order to spend a lot of attention .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these circumstances -- a surgeon that i talked to a few years ago , who had taken some sidewalk with him to divide them to make a name .
in order to remind these theories , we call ourselves in memory , that it &apos;s definitely about high gram , it has to be about a high-end goal , and it &apos;s probably very likely to be in iran , because most of the infected infections .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you &apos;re going to get the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in oven about whether you should have that , if you want to get things faster or more innovation than we expect .
this was a huge upset at the time , because , of course , you started to attach the living language of writing , which means , which is what fluid and lifestyle , and i &apos;m manipulating it in stone , and i &apos;m also manipulating it .
as the golden cat corporation , her 10 to the worst selling category , she was told that the wins of 87 percent -- a result of the rise , the rise of the numbers and the cost of the cost of cost .
so the tedtalk was very simple in very simple shape that a charter city is a place where uninhabited land is an informed country , a founder of the laws that determines the laws that are there , and the people can choose to decide either to live under these rules or not .
we followed the genetic technology back eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural tower , and when we asked people to do something about it , they asked them that one of the people were so old that he died because of his age , and we still killed him with the spears .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our trust . it &apos;s trust me , but if we all look at these genes that we can eliminate from one another after another , it &apos;s probably unlikely to make a living cell .
if you were just going to take a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose this wish that &apos;s going to be made , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to have to have carbon dioxide , and i &apos;m going to have that wish .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is somebody who &apos;s freaked it , when he &apos;s injured , because he knows , he &apos;s not very good at the brush of a snow .
at this point , the patients come to play . they can &apos;t just take control of control , capitalism can be on their own ship , but can also help us face health problems that are helping us , and the cost of the public health explosion , doubt , and so on .
and then there &apos;s a memory of self , and the memory itself is itself , which is counts and receives the story of our lives , and it &apos;s the sense of the doctor that he &apos;s talking about , &quot; how did you feel about the last time ? &quot;
now in the world of savings , i think one of the best examples of what happened in the market is , as you know , the best choice of choice , something that david lacharge has very strong design , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
about an hour after she came home , after i finished her home , collapsed her , and she called the family 911 , and the rescue assistance brought back to the emergency center of a blood pressure of 50 pressure , which is a dangerous state .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform before the malayan coast , and at the young man who was collapsed and died , and the end of the journey was too much for him , and the first flavor of the first apples that gave me one of the men &apos;s platform .
now , what this thing is doing is that it &apos;s beginning to recover the sensors of sensory sensors -- so for example , for example , sensory sensors and vibration -- and it makes it legitimies available to the code that &apos;s still on the basis , with the wrong data .
how can these people come from a flora from 80,000 species of adolescent plants that don &apos;t find these two morphologically related plants that can be combined if these kinds of biochemical version , which is so bigger than the sum of its parts ?
and there was a time in which there was only a jeans in a way , and they bought them , and they got bad , they were incredibly compatible , and if they were carrying them long enough and often wasted enough , they started feeling ok . &quot;
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t perceive that there are only three fingers here : because the mind and the way it works , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three , but it looks like a group .
and these sound and the rhythm , the geology , which put together topography of a region , and that , of course , is that you could put these little fragments and you could put them together , and you could go back to the left , and go back to the right , and go back to the back to the back to the plant .
i also think there are theories that start to understand how everything that &apos;s started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplistic story about which is that , at that time , these little oil spills , which contains different kinds of recipients .
how often we chose a political leader -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we &apos;ll resist back , and we expect that the government , the government , our reflects and our needs , and then hasn &apos;t changed a lot ?
now , this was able to happen within the life of a single organism , which has been done by hundreds of thousands of years , because these evolutionary information had to be learned from the individuals who had to be launched because of these fertilizers , because those information structures were not yet available .
for example , there &apos;s an anecdote for example that the report of a chapter of a capita hands-on , so that in this area can &apos;t be used in large fish , not used by fishermen , or from fishermen , is usually done by scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
you know , you know , the genocide , the physical strategy of people will be convicted by people , but the ethnod , the destruction of life , the destruction of human beings , not only will not be convicted , but a general and a lot of a development strategy .
what if you could change the sperm and the eggs or the frog &apos;s frog , to give your kids a better chance for a healthy life -- the diabetes , the diabetes , the risk of cancer , the risk of cancer ?
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are the ones that are thermonophil , and by the way , they would survive the hot lip if fish were there , they would have acoustic vacuals to be able to make it a living environment for themselves .
the great genetics in the 20th century , t.u. dozhansky , who was also a communications in the russian orthodox church , once wrote a phrase that said , &quot; don &apos;t make any sense of biology in biology . &quot;
and if you do that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve done it for a few minutes , that the life itself is alive , and you &apos;ve done it , and you &apos;ve done it , you &apos;ve memorized that the memory of patients is much better , because now you &apos;ve got a better patient about your experience .
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals , not just a farm that measures your success of your health , but a farm that is literally a water plant , and not just for these fish , but for me and for you .
you know , as a translator , it &apos;s not just the word for the word &quot; text &quot; in a different language , but it also has to understand the deep sense of words and what it &apos;s needed to understand , so that there &apos;s a meaningful translation , everybody who has foreign language to do with strangers .
and again , if i look at a step back , and i can look at everything , i can relook at my lost time on my search for search for my past , and here , i &apos;m going to be looking for netitititistic , here , right here , or from here , to live here , to live here , or live here .
now , what you could do with patient , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , and it &apos;s actually , you could actually reverse the reflection of digestiploma by just leaving the diving in there without having it in it very much .
you &apos;re going to do it by the future , the will , the will , the ocean , and the ocean is the challenging environment , which is the most challenging environment , and you &apos;re making it out of the space , and because of the strange connection , which is when a small group of people are formed by a team .
and i took them down and i took them access to the world at the bottom of the world : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in such extreme situations , and i took them to the sources of the sources , and they were able to take sample and take sample instruments and so on .
you understand that it &apos;s not just that it &apos;s not just that people have to eat the dog food , if they &apos;re going to go to the ruins , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go back , it means that it &apos;s hard to make decisions , that it &apos;s so hard to fit large investments of their employment .
and as this whole time , you &apos;re going to bring cultural into the values of your society , the values that you &apos;re talking about , that your prayers , and only your prayers , the cosmic cosmic -- or we might say , &quot; ecological weight &quot; -- equity .
the leaders of the government in honduras would depend on the aid of partnerships , they could benefit from their partnerships , which they would be supporting to the laws of the laws of charter and charter , that everybody could trust the charter that the charter will really be transformed .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the ideal rice to play with the new elements -- how the hostile -- and how the game requires both to support both -- while it &apos;s also fun .
he went to high speed at high speed , and he suddenly drove a little bit of a fragmentation of a melody , which is how it &apos;s often vital for him , and it &apos;s hard . and he wants to do it . it &apos;s gorgeous . he loves it , but he can &apos;t touch it .
another example : a few years ago , i got the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as a boy , when he had a boy , he had a friend , had a friend of mine lived with his girlfriend , and he had just found that he had a frozen and a mother .
but there &apos;s only a company that was ready to help us -- and that &apos;s just because i know john bond and richard shena for years -- i found that i had to do it alone , i had to go to go to the middle class and go to my team .
in fact , i &apos;ve set up the greatest part of my career for an awful lot of situations , and it &apos;s all for the trial to try to analyze the game so that you can look at the rare and hopefully interesting , and hopefully , in a way , what you &apos;re doing for the audience and accessible .
and this curiosity also showed me that , whenever i wasn &apos;t in school , through the forests , through the forests , and they go , &quot; samples , &quot; frog and snakes and snakes and snakes , all the water , and the microscope came home and looked at the microscope .
she ran out like the devil house as she was arrested by this poem , and it was the only thing that she had to get quickly enough to a piece of paper , and she had to get to a pen , so that she could get it out of the neck , and she could capture the sheet of the sheet .
the next weeks , i made it for me , and i went to the first time , the unhealthy self , which exists in our medical culture -- i felt isolated alone , not the kind of healthy , which you feel , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
now , i may be a little bit extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the memories of memories , but even if you make more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give you a lot of memories so much weight in the mind that we give to the experience ?
you can imagine this cultural grid as a ethnic of ethnicity , and ethnicity can be defined as the total sum of all thoughts and dreams , myths , mystical ideas , and intuitions that have been redefined by human imagination since the imagination of consciousness , one of consciousness has been defined .
so where the founding fathers were extremely excited about how individuals could be protected to the state of the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers in this concept , we have more a concept of cheese , not just how to protect each other , but how to worry about each other .
the main reason for this is that maybe we can choose to choose this huge shelf of mayan , senior senior , senior , to look at margins and melting , but we can &apos;t take the same scarcity and then actually choose something out of the fantastic deal .
by playing music , and he was talking about music , from this paranoid , confused man who was just moved by the streets of los angeles , a benign , delicate , nevertheless , in july trained musicians .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life was the tom of his body &apos;s body &apos;s body &apos;s empire artist , who was trying to control this uncontrollable impulse of creative impulse that he got to the habits , and with them .
so i &apos;m going to describe to you now a study that i saw with gur huberman , eyena , i was doing ji , who was doing the decisions that we were making for the rent for the rent of nearly a million americans around the united states in the united states .
and the reason for that is , if i would draw it on a normal curve , where we say , this is the years , so the timeline of a type , and this is a kind of popular technology that i want to talk to you with a grave , then the graph will say .
and when i think about it , i think about a vacation , which we did a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i had ever had , and i think was pretty much about how often i think of the relationship to others .
and maybe a little bit of a look at what might happen in a few decades , if you have cyborg bodies to do something or other things , in all sorts of humanitarian scenarios that i can think of as a science fan .
a lot of companies tend to -- and this is the human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not safe , they &apos;re not going to be afraid , they &apos;re going to avoid these elements , and that they &apos;re welcome to these arbitrary , and they &apos;re actually turning to themselves into something positive , and that &apos;s a storyline .
we don &apos;t have the situation of how it &apos;s for example in iran &apos;s case , where a man who feels at the other sexual men , who &apos;s beaten to death with death penalty , because it &apos;s ready to take a gender transformation in which case he can stay alive .
and you &apos;re going to be educated by using the use of the trigger , and you &apos;re going to be more educated by the khani academic , and by doing that , by using the possibility , you &apos;re going to have the possibility of 3d printing and powers , and so much more productive than ever before .
now , we know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t have a line between us and male , or between male and sexuality and sexuality and sexuality ; we &apos;re going to be able to separate these lines of course .
so if you look at google glass , for example , then there &apos;s such a concept of what the virtual world is doing with recombining the real world , it &apos;s called the monkey to virtual content , which is a virtual , to find it natural , recommended .
i &apos;ve been interested in some time since i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect , and it may seem strange that a magician might be interested in it , because they think of it as i say , &quot; as a deception , which will be something that if somebody will only believe enough about it . &quot;
we worked with roberto bolto bolto , which is one of the best ballet dancing dancers of our time -- the methane at the metropolitan theater in new york city , and the scala in mailala -- and we took his movements in 3d to use them as the impulse for the impulse .
there are some mushroom projects that are doing this on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to get 100 percent hard to get it very difficult , and it &apos;s an agreement for co2 , which is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the question .
so what you got was , this is what you saw : your name here : my tedtalk , which you have no idea of what &apos;s going to be the subject , and the more content that you could fly to the oars to fly the oars , especially if i &apos;m involved in your company , the company for your dumb .
and in this song , we will be able to rediscover the possibility of what we are : people who are conscious , who are aware of the importance of consciousness , that all people and gardens and gardens can become a habitat of eggs . and there must be great moments of optimism .
now , these older people come to me and say to me , &quot; mr , &quot; stemson , vendson , you talk about it , and they say that people should stop telling you that we have the first time to do it in the history of our nation with terrorism , &quot; after 9 / 11 / 11 . &quot;
and the people in the back , or the people who look at this later on the video will say , &quot; well , this looks pretty impressive , but if it was real , it would be -- you &apos;ll see , here &apos;s a hole , and there &apos;s a hole , if it was really , really , it would be flower . &quot;
now , as a result of that , he &apos;s particularly pronounced for this schizophrenic phasis , and sometimes it &apos;s so bad , and he &apos;s disappeared , and he &apos;s disappeared in the streets of passenger pigeon collide , and always the horror and torture of his own mind .
he was talking to a very healer and healthier about yo-yo and hillary clinton , and how the dodgers would never make it in the world , and it would be because of the first passenger pigeon in the last beethoven &apos; 70s .
every time we think of innate and landscape and landscape , we can either grab the seaw and the old framework of the noble wilderness , which is a simplistic thought , or elsewhere , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
i wanted to go to the routine and the quiry of life &apos;s unknown life -- a grandmother , a mother , two mother and two daughters who have been so abundant for 20 years by smiling each other &apos;s stories , and we still have three bed in the same bed .
but we don &apos;t even know when we hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve been able to tell this kind of time for a long time , and somehow we &apos;ve accepted the aspiration of light and collective acceptance that creativity and somehow , of course , that art and art -- at the end of the seal .
and what we did was , in fact , to use a new kind of network that was used around the world -- this is a mobile phone net -- and anonymous information from this network that &apos;s been collected from the oil to understand how the city works .
and then the renaissance and everything changed , and we had this big idea . and this big idea was this big idea : let &apos;s put human individual on the center of the universe -- about all the gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no room for mythic creatures that assume from the gods .
in our wish to protect people who are in the heart of the hearts , and they &apos;re the calcium truth about their medical judgments , or even a prosthetic quality of the quality of life that they have to expect that we don &apos;t adapt that somebody is actually disabled .
i told you about four techniques , which is the problem of decision-making , millennium locations -- they &apos;re going to be the overwhelming alternatives ; concrete ; they &apos;re doing it ; they &apos;re real categorization -- we can better deal with categories , less ways ; they &apos;re prepared for complexity .
because we have this self-deception , this sense of being great , triggering of the highest creature , not from such a replacement , such as something unpredictable as one organism , which is still a comparable , and otherwise , which is uncomfortable for us .
and then this is , if you &apos;re all your feelings about politics , and you &apos;re doing it for a long time , and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about , the government , in the words , in the words of tim lo , which we can &apos;t do it alone .
this may seem first , perhaps , a little bit of absence , so i &apos;ll repeat it , so that if we can solve problems like hunger , climate change , global conflict , obesity and obesity , i think we need to try to play , at least for about 21 billion hours a week to play the next week .
and the goal was , we just wanted to go to seventh seventh , and we wanted to get back to 9-percent renewable , and then stay here , the rest of this , the rest of the rest , the last 10 percent , which is going to be very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work that you &apos;re working out of batteries .
but what &apos;s going to find is 17 marking partners who were willing to spend on these control of control , who wanted to do business with somebody who wanted to do so much , and how i forgot to tell us , and to tell us how to tell the stories that we wouldn &apos;t usually have -- stories that would never be supported to support .
but in fact , you had to think about it for a long time , but you could never be reasonably clear if it was going to work , but since there were modern computer computers , you can simulate it , and you can see that , yes , yes , with the right materials , it looks like it worked out there .
but the process and the severe bridges , which was surrounded by him , when he took the genius out of it , where he didn &apos;t go back to the conclusion , and he &apos;d let him go back to where he came from , and he realized that it didn &apos;t have to be an inexhaustible thing .
this curious event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called roy , pray , love , love -- that decided that all of my previous books would come out of any kind of stuff in the world , and a big deal , international design thing .
a continuous continent is always left , because the guess was that there was no religious faith in sub-saharan africa , of course , and of course , there was a voodoo , it &apos;s just the remaining of this very profound religious thought that during the tragedies of the tragedies of slavery .
but in truth , we see it more and more and more , that if you &apos;re ready to confront , and the unimportant options are going to be unbelievable , then there &apos;s an increase in the numbers of numbers , there &apos;s the cost of cost , and there &apos;s an improvement , and there &apos;s a improvement of decision-making .
and one day , he was looking at me at one of my practices -- these practices were just tighteen and naggline -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , wow , you &apos;re a powerful , powerful , powerful , and you &apos;re one of the girls who were one of these bars .
and you have wind and sun and the burden of simultaneously , and you got to the outcome , which is a very exciting outcome of the conventional system that you have in the conventional system , which takes about a five-cent estrogen from about a five-cent kilowatt-hour , which is about four cents a mile in four cents .
and the problem , it &apos;s not just a technological problem , it can be a social problem , it can be just a full-time problem , which is how simple things , so a problem , a problem , a question , and how can you throw it differently or how to do it better .
fetching the plant of plant groundbreaking , scarless pools of caring on monomonal cultures , chemicals on the planet , the whole time , and the entire agricultural industry just asked , &quot; if we feed more people more cheap , how horrible can that be ? &quot;
not by the latest mice , and tractors and tractors , but through fruit land , not through pumps , but through water , not by frozen water , not by tenacious , but by lawyers , and not by fishing and fishing , but through the sea .
now , this is a more artistic direction , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and philosophers and collaboration with scientists to sit down with these technologies and ask for questions , and that &apos;s the creative process , because there are plenty of art , and there &apos;s all kinds of things .
they &apos;re going to put them up the output of carbon dioxide , which leads to the temperature , and this temperature has some very negative implications . on the weather , and perhaps worse , and perhaps the indicates that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to the ecosystems , and they can collapse all the systems together .
so up-at-at-at-attributes are things that are wired to be frozen , like the prince , prince , tied , disabled , and lovely such as suitable , and agile , and agile , in professional , magical , magical and mystically and mystically .
in other words , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran up and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t cut the house , and the poem , and she walked through them through them , and she said it was going to move over land , and as she said -- and as she said , they were looking for another poet .
this may be a modern-day contribution , and if you want to do better than i expect , but my core statement here is that we have to work on all the five , and we can &apos;t give them an effort to them because they agree , because all of us have significant problems .
and as you can see , where you can see how far we &apos;re going to get away from what we really wanted and how sad we are , and how sad we are we &apos;re at the same time , you can see that , for example , there &apos;s an open program , for example , you want to be 4,000 clients here , right ?
about 20 years of the medical sensation of medicine and journalism , i created a personal medical study about medical mistakes and wrong treatment to make everything possible for my first article , which i wrote for the toronto my face of the white star show of my white star , &quot; black hole , &quot; to learn .
now , with the total transparency of the total transparency , which is the new thinking about what the old buttons think , don &apos;t tell you that in the lash meat industry , and no more meat meat or other phenomena , which is what i want to do right now , and i just want to do that .
now , not exactly what i hoped to do , but i went to go up -- the stairs , the airstream , along the real firemen , the &quot; firemen &apos;s firemen , who were at that point where they were pretty high , into the bedroom in the room to get a few shoes .
i had to restore individual instances , finally , repeatedly with these thick , elastic changes -- in different colors -- you know , to build my leg muscles , and i had these dancers hated more than anything . i hated them . i posted them . i hated them .
but we wanted to go a lot further . we wanted to build a whole bacterial chromosome , and it has more than 50,000 letters genetic code , so we thought we could build it in the size of the virus , which we could understand the size of the size of the variations to understand what the individual cell is .
and from a conversation today with dean , one of the innovators of the c , i want to share with you something with them -- he gave me the permission -- his geo-engineering , &quot; the slingling , &quot; and many of you may have heard about it . it &apos;s the size of a refrigerator student at home .
now , &quot; clouds , &quot; something that my friends in autodesk call &quot; selective news &quot; -- sensors , sensors and robots , robots , 3d printer that enable us to democratize the personal production of our planet , democratized , synthetic biology , biology , food and digital medicine , digital bio-o-intelligence and artificial intelligence .
you can see this amazing demonstrations : voodoo aggression in a state of light , the light bulbs without burning , an amazing illustration of the ability to affect the mind so that it holds in an extreme state of behavior .
this was the most surgical form of a d√©ju , which i had ever experienced , because before i knew a corner , i always knew what was going on in the lighting vehicle , because i was running the film of a film , as we walked into the movie .
in this picture , i had a busy bush as a center of desperation in all directions , because if you look at the root of the tree of life , all of the existing specifications in this two-story have been in evolutionary success : they have survived ; it has demonstrated its environment and strength .
and so , with this premise with this premise with this premise , for example , brian gger in england tries to put a minimum together , and then put a steam cooperations on it , and it &apos;s a hot , and it &apos;s a hot , and it &apos;s got so cool , and then it &apos;s got bacteria growing .
and then it came from the do-it-it-the-box plant , which is the founder of founder , and said , &quot; o.k , we have to meet now , we have to make a real , and then two previews , one in london , one in a second , 10 , 10 , and just to the u.s.a , san francisco , in san francisco .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to get to zero , and that will depend on the number of people , depending on the services , which uses every person in the average , which uses the average energy for every year , and the co2 per unit , which is emitting per unit of energy .
and the insight of president lobo was that , in fact , the fact that the wisdom of the action that i thought about was as a way to get the foreign investors to come and build this city , could be meaningful for all the parties in honeyas , who have suffered a lot of fear of anxiety and suffer .
and i read this list by a friend of mine , and i had to read this , and i had to laugh at this time , and it was so ridiculous , but i just came up with , &quot; i couldn &apos;t talk , &quot; and i had to stop reading , and i had to stop reading myself after this extent , and make the emotional fluid out of it .
i learned a group from argenta that i &apos;ve learned a little bit about a while ago that this is a student who wants to convey the public who wanted to communicate more about what they learn in college , and they &apos;ve done so on the street , and they &apos;re trying to explain to people , which is n.a .
there are 175 addresses in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 different extra obesity , and 12 balances that you could buy a large number of sales in your own sales , in which the unlikely case that the 175 , that the 175 is right for you .
and this was really , really , very , very , very bitter , and you &apos;ll get into this phase , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s going to go through a picture where i &apos;ve been asked 10 years to do this , you know , you know , you know , of course , that &apos;s supposed to be so great .
well , what i &apos;m going to show you first is as quickly as possible , as quickly as possible , the fundamental work is a new technology that we think of as microsoft as an exception to one year ago , and that &apos;s seatragon . and it &apos;s a environment where you can either go to the local environment , or with huge amounts of visual data .
so , the first one , if you &apos;re going to be a child , as a child , as a baby , is that you take care of what &apos;s going to take out of it , and you know if you have your parents , whether or not allowed your parents to play more or not to play more in your pocket and play more , you &apos;re going to be sort of curious about their curiosity .
i mean , i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i have this error -- you know , the psychological psychological present for about three seconds , which means that you know , there &apos;s about 600 million lives in about 600 million dollars . in a month , there &apos;s about 60,000 people . most of them don &apos;t leave behind them .
bill bill gates : in order to do the simulation on a supercomputer , get all the big scientists to get what we &apos;ve done , we just need a few million dollars , and even if we &apos;ve done our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s just a $ 100 million .
so this works really , really , that &apos;s going to be done in the academic , and then we thought , o.o.k , which we might have done a webcam , and then we took a webcam , and then the pile pile , and then you turn a microscope , which is a microscope , which is a microscope , which is about a four-sized piano .
and if i show you about 600 tips , and you put them in 10 categories , or i &apos;ll show you 400 times , and i &apos;ll show you this in 20 categories , and then you believe that i &apos;ve given them more choices , and i &apos;ve given them a better experience than i would have given them 400 to them when i &apos;ve given them 600 .
it &apos;s friday &apos;s friday friday friday , friday friday friday friday friday . friday friday friday friday . friday friday friday , friday friday . you don &apos;t think we &apos;d do this conversation without talking about this video .
i think i think i think a significant changer -- not the only thing , but a significant changer to the explosion of depression , the depression , and even suicide , is that people have experience that are disappointed , because their standards are so high . and then , if they have to explain these experiences themselves , they think it would be their fault .
the neolithic revolution that brought us to agriculture , and in this moment , we had the cult of the season , the poetry , the poetry of the eship through the propensity of the proposal and the hierarchy , and specialized hierarchy , and just found that was only 10,000 years ago -- rather than 10,000 years ago .
this is , if you focus a laser in the room , you can catch a little particles in the room , then you can catch small particles in the air , or in the fluid , and then in this focus , so that &apos;s where you start , so you can catch a kind of like a trajectorial puncture in the room .
well , it would be great if we could take this paradigm of the normal paradigm of the normal or the power of the power or the power of the power to even formulate a little more dangerous , audable , and so we can put the forces of a lot of kids , and put them in the very special store , and put their values into society .
you know , you know , when michelo shaped the mosquitos , it means that he took the hammer on the end , and in fact , you can &apos;t see it on moss -- you can still see a little bit of a little bit of wonder under -- and said , &quot; permitchon parlion ? why don &apos;t you do it ? &quot;
but if you take a new color in 2011 today , you buy a new color printer printer of the leading printing press , and you print a page , and then you print this side , and then you print this site on every side on every side , in a pattern that makes you look at the clearly , and you &apos;re tracking your clicker again .
i mean , my colleague at mit , ashman saf , you could take a lot more about the true and take the many other wonderful things that you can do with real , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we &apos;re going to talk about , and that &apos;s the environment that we &apos;re looking at , and that &apos;s our environment .
now , the problem , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us , those of us who have the sympathy for the hard time , they have an ordered and colorful and colorful , but they sort of look at the past , while the real world is regarding our world .
and then i tried to do this in my lab , and i tried to do it in my lab , a little bit of work , and then i went to buy this kind of man-hand-tap bay , and i bought a little bit of ni analysis , which is trying to make a test , so a dfather &apos;s like this , prince , prince , even at home .
and if you were to choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species , and you have to think about how you decide that conflict , and that &apos;s not really obvious , because if you think about it in time , and if you get an answer , and if you think about it , if you could get a different answer to your memories .
in the early 800s , i got a really amazing task when my professor at harvard asked if i was interested to go to haiti and film the secret societies , who were the foundation of dumb and max couton and pore , which was used to make it safe .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to talk about how i &apos;m going to go around with vibrating , and i &apos;m going to tell you something : this phrase has never adapted for me , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable with the questions of people , and i think , and i understand why i understand why i understand why .
and if i &apos;m going to transfer that now , for example , for example , in the way that i &apos;m thinking of overwhelming , selective selective , in which all of which it comes up to me , i can get to the detail , and yes , i can throw it anywhere else , or buy somebody , and so on and so on .
i recommend all of you to read steves or see the movie , so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connection between these two men , but also how the music helped create music , and how they ended up making the instrument , when this game is allowed to get the audiences to get the alongside of the street .
so here in the picture , you can see the lab , in the lab , so there &apos;s this kind of garage , so there &apos;s a garage with all kinds of lab labs , which has done a group in paris , which has done in paris , and it &apos;s pretty successful , and it &apos;s quite interesting , because i want to cut a project .
not a biologist would claim to say , for example , that 50 percent of the 50 percent or more of all species are extinct , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet , that -- the apocalyptic scenarium on the area of biological diversity -- hardly what &apos;s known as optimistic , which is known as the most optimistic diversity of the cultural diversity in the cultural area .
bg : well , we haven &apos;t set ourselves on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting authorities for everything called &quot; nuclear , &quot; and there &apos;s a big interest in russia , and there &apos;s a lot of people in russia in russia , india , india -- i &apos;ve been here -- and i &apos;ve been here to the empowerment of energy , and how this is adapted to energy .
so , the computer visions , you know , have these pictures together , and they put them in the real room , and they &apos;re all running around the grassroots in the grassroots rockeks , and they &apos;re talking about the elements of diploma , or the diploma , and these things were all transmitted to each other .
and if you &apos;re in part of the software that we &apos;ve just seen , it &apos;s going to look at what you &apos;re going to understand , why nine-nine-percent of our software is not a little bit intuitive or user , it &apos;s called the ipad in many areas or iphones , even though it &apos;s much more intuitive as a piece of software .
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy , &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but the reality is a shift of the responsibility for someone who knows what &apos;s going to know about somebody &apos;s choices -- the namiority of somebody who knows nothing -- who &apos;s probably not sick and therefore in the best census of the census -- is to make a patient -- the patient &apos;s a choice .
this idea was when i was in the middle of the writing process , pray , pray , love . i fell in one of these two slides that we fall into , if we &apos;re all working on something , and you don &apos;t start thinking about it , and you &apos;re going to think it &apos;s going to be a disaster that &apos;s going to be written . the most challenging book that &apos;s ever written .
and we also have one of those same aggregator in the same size of the same size , as it &apos;s there , in half the hall , to actually take the full dynamic behavior of this grid , which is what it looks like in half the back now , which is the lel here , which is the big battery here , which we can simultaneously simulate the net .
and they believed that a genius was this kind of magical divinity that it was believed that it was literally made in the words of an artist &apos;s artistic artist -- about as dobby , the cotton -- the cheese and the artist , in a sense , in a very unbelievable way , and the work would make the work of the work of the work .
if i want to give you one thing to you today , it &apos;s that the amount of data that we consume is greater than the sum parts of their parts , and instead of thinking about information , i want you to think about how we can use information so that we can use information , and we can see the trends that have not seen .
so we &apos;ve done a study that i &apos;ve done with shlomo benari and alessandro , we &apos;ve done a study with people -- all the people who &apos;ve been working for -- and these people were all involved in a collection where they were involved in their savings plan for their savings .
now , interesting historical note : as the moore &apos;s mosquitos brought them up with these conversations , and the language changed over the centuries of allah , allah , lah allah , allah , angu√© , you &apos;re still struggled to fight the mood , and you &apos;re still fighting with dancers .
now , today , you need to use , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this -- something that comes up here in real time , which has a few thousand sensors that information from the car , to give the information to the system , and then you &apos;re going to work and then use these things to make decisions in this car , and then you &apos;re going to change things in real time .
i was afraid , not fear , but i was afraid that i could lose him that he could fall into a circumstance , and that i could destroy his relationship to the hostile relationship , if i began to talk about clay and pearos and other sorts of excitement , i could talk about the sels of pediets .
so , in fact , the fact is that you remember the 20th century , in 300 years , not for your wars , or technological innovation , but it &apos;s more than a era that we were in , and the massive destruction of biological destruction and cultural diversity in either of the earth , or passively accepted , so that &apos;s not the problem of change .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which meant the measurements in visual effects of visual effects and generated computer effects in a whole new cave new sense , with human realistic characteristics , expressive characters that were made by cotton . and the key should be all the key . and the world should be cable .
i &apos;ll probably hear you , probably , the two nice girls are still there , because i &apos;m probably listening to the generation , which has been healthy for this bad image , because i &apos;ve started to study ninety-hundreds of thousands of nests , i &apos;ve already started studying bioluminescence in karlessly , which is high-tech , which is what you think today , i think , is kit &apos;s kissed .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a fragile answer to one of my lectures , who had a reader story . &#91; unclear &#93; -- he said he &apos;d heard a sink , and it was absolutely music , and at the end of the day , there was a terrible sound of the sound .
you know ? i think you know ? i think , a mere person allows me to allow you to think , or you &apos;re like the vessel , like that , and the essence and the source of all the divine , creative , unknown , unknown mysterious mysterious , is a little bit too small to take you to take you a sense of a human psyche , human psyche .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and at the same time , the co2 will say , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t really care me that it wasn &apos;t a carbon emitting , i wish that it would accept , but i &apos;ll accept it , because it &apos;s a cheap way of predicting it . &quot;
it &apos;s actually the kind of existence that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who has a patient , say , we had two reflective surgeries of two different surgeons , and who chooses what he &apos;s supposed to choose , who &apos;s chosen , who &apos;s got the memory , who &apos;s less , and that &apos;s the surgeon , the surgeon , the surgeon , the surgeon will be chosen .
you know , they all know the healthy dogs , if you give a secret to the best friend &apos;s prize , even though this one gets swallowed , and then you get the best friend , and the best friend confronts a discussion , and a terrible discussion , if you get to the end of the bad thing , and you will never make a mistake that you will never make a mistake again .
you know , you know , one of the great guards of traveling , and one of the freudian research in the ethical research is to live with people who are still remembering the old days . the past can still feel their past , they &apos;re still in the rain , and they &apos;re infamous in the rain , they &apos;re working in the leaves of the leaves .
if you &apos;ve ever had the opportunity to do the opportunity to work in a city ticket center , like our scott develops , you &apos;re doing part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re all going to see -- you &apos;re all going to see that people who are calling a lot of different problems , including themselves , including a quarter in their house .
so , in fact , the nice thing about this is , when you do this , you do this , you make agriculture , you make biogas , on a hectar country , you can put five thousand living things in favelas so that it can take about a quarter of a hundred thousand dollars , and you wait the economies , and you get the pig and you grow a chickle and your vegetables and your vegetables .
we &apos;re at the amazing threshold of the threshold , amazing events in many areas . and yet , i think we &apos;ve got to go back to 300 years ago to go back to finding a time to find a time where we have progress in which we have these things about these things that we have more precious , more than we now , more than we are now in front of them .
so by using color , contrality and contemporary change to change the individual images , photographic disabled fish , like the deep rocks and distinguished colors and disturbing colors , we leave the different boundaries between the different images , and what it looks like , even though an image of hundreds of thousands can contain hundreds of genes .
now , if i were to take a room full of colleagues in a room with colleagues , and to ask their sovereign support support support , and tell them what i &apos;d just told you about , i probably wouldn &apos;t be able to do the second end of the second story before it really would be uncomfortable , somebody would have a joyful joke , and they would forget the rest of the subject and forget the rest of it .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good moment to turn your audio , take your personal communication device -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can take a look at kathryn book , which is about , because there &apos;s nothing else in this talk about you &apos;re going to make sense of anything .
a couple of years ago , the laser prize for shinya inyamyamana was taken for his research in which he took a sculptor , a fiber , and through the manipulation of only four genes to restore them to a pluripotent cell -- a potential cell in the popular body is able to become a body in your body .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve made all kinds of batteries that are made , the cars , for cars , mobile phones , cell phones , for everything , and i &apos;ve done a lot of the electronic energy that uses the world , and i found out that all the batteries that we can now produce less than 10 minutes of the lawn .
so let &apos;s take a step back to the beginning of the big bang 14 years ago -- the earth , the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of living , maybe three and a half billion years ago , maybe the earth on earth -- the first majority or so , maybe as much as a billion years ago -- and then the human species -- and then the species , eventually , which changed the last 130,000 years .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral notre , which ended up in the computer with flickr of flickr , and they just give the emergency room to flickr , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts , and on the university of all the way . each of these farthief reviews represented a model that was discovered as a model of this model .
and yet , in this country , in this country , in the united states of the old south , we &apos;re going to make people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted to death , if the victims are higher , if the victims are black . if it &apos;s 22 times higher , if the decline is black , and it &apos;s black -- this is the same thing in the world -- in the states , the body of the earth &apos;s body .
i once traveled with a young colleagues of 60,000 miles of india in china , in china , through southetia , and when i first sat down to lhasa , i saw the face of the statistics of which you hear -- 60,000 monuments that were transformed in 1,000 and 1.2 million people while the cultural revolution were murdered by the cultural revolution .
and that &apos;s why the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of problems that have to invest in something that you &apos;ve only got later -- and that &apos;s why the investment is not so clear , and in fact , the ipcc isn &apos;t necessarily not necessarily the worst thing , and there are people in the rich world who look at the rich world , and say , pc , that &apos;s not a big drama .
we put the chromosome of the chromosome of the chromosome species . big , these two are the same as humans and mice , and we gave them some extra genes to choose this chromosome , and we could destroy it to destroy all the enzymes , and it was very astonishing when we put it in a cell , and we put it into a cell into a cell -- and we &apos;ll appreciate our cell very , very , very sophisticated .
margaret mead , who said great anthropologist before she died that it &apos;s the biggest fear that while we were in the direction of a failed , unstable view , we &apos;re not only moving the entire range of human imagination in a way , but we would have a dream of a dream of a dream day , and that we &apos;ve ever forgotten it , and we &apos;ve ever forgot it that there &apos;s ever forgotten possibilities .
i &apos;d like to suggest that i &apos;d like to show you a straight line of the original data of noah , and this is from a early prototype of photosynth photosynth that we &apos;ve been working on the summer to show you what i think is really looking at the way of this technology that is photosynthetic technology , and this is not so clear , and this is not so obvious when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
in other words , sugar pills have shown in some studies of the measurements , the placebo effect , and that &apos;s just because the person thinks what happens to her , whether it &apos;s a pharmaceutical or a kind of pharmaceutical form , for example , for example , if there &apos;s only a patient who believes in the body that &apos;s called the placebo effect .
if one of them said no , it was the vope cattle , which has been a totally broken mess . i &apos;ve been able to doubt for 10 years , whether i think i &apos;m going to have a great engineering of engineering to have a really dumb , because all the colleagues of my father &apos;s colleagues , you &apos;ve always been talking to the window , you &apos;ve made the money out of your child in a child .
i had recently met an encounter like me as i met the extraordinary american divorce in ruth , which is now over 90 , but the whole life of her entire life , and she told me that when she was growing up in the villages of virginia , she was working on the field , and she said , &quot; you can listen to a poem on the landscape . &quot;
it means that there &apos;s a little child coming out of the angles that &apos;s growing up in believing that the mountain is a mountain of your mind , your fate or your destiny , will determine another person , and another relationship to this relationship , or to this place , or to have a little child growing from a little kid who &apos;s growing up in the mountain , that a pickle is a pile that can be carried .
usually my role is to explain to people how wonderful technologies are going to come up with the new technologies that are coming up , and i thought there i &apos;m here , i &apos;m here , i &apos;m going to tell you what i &apos;m really thinking about , and also trying to look back to understand what &apos;s going on here with these incredible jumps , which are so that we can &apos;t get into the front of us .
and that would be , and that would be the answer to the bjn of jargomborg , that if you use all this time and energy to solve all the co2 , all the other goals , the other goals , the reduction , the poverty reduction of malaria , and so on , there is a dumb of money resources , while there are better things that we can do .
so these guys have come online to travel online , but they &apos;ve been illegal to do it by using trojans to cry money from our bank bank account , while we &apos;re doing our online banking banking , or the keyboard , our credit information cardits , but they &apos;ve collected the information about the keyboard , while we &apos;re buying a computer online computer online .
she came back to monks , again , came back to montgomist , where she had two of her oldest friends . these older women , johns , carnir , the montgomerson &apos;s boyboyott -- an incredible root -- and virginia , a former white man , a husband , a white clifford , dr. king , dr. king winning , dr. king .
and the ones that have been there have been two more bathed and said , &quot; o.k , we &apos;re doing easier and cheaper , and then we &apos;ve got open source , and then , you know , open source hardware , electronics , things like this one , and now they &apos;re the contractors that have actually brought the market to market , and they &apos;re the most cheap of these devices around the world .
and this made me a different person to another person than my friends under the kwavelul , who believe that these forests contain the rise of the algak of hubbercuous and the mutituous and the canadian canadian , who are in the northearship of the northardy world , they would participate in their hairs .
a week ago , a week before a week ago , the national academy of academics are the dragging dragline for francis narnaris and wilderness , two scientists who developed independent scientists that have developed the natural process of encouraging the natural process of evolution to work faster and wield a remarkable proteins in a efficient way -- which is called &quot; narnina evolution . &quot;
and now , i &apos;m going to go to this point in biology , and because i want to take this metaphor out of synthetic biology , that biology is that biology is actually an information science , because the ni code is a abstract code , which is a abstract code , which is not exactly the same as computers , because there &apos;s matter , because it &apos;s matter , so it &apos;s real matter , so it &apos;s not just cyber , and cyber .
so , bruce bruce bruce brown , a well-known design researcher at the british university , has gone so far to say that this mass media , the book , and the book , not the internet , etc . , etc . , so on and so on and so on , what we call the mass media media , that these media media companies have enabled us to have our hands , and have our capacity to have our virtual strength .
i &apos;m sure some really , really , some happy people and companies and companies , for-profit , profits and profitable , because i &apos;m sure that chris anderson will never let me leave -- the right to buy the rights of the talk that they just didn &apos;t have a lot of content at the time , and there was a lot of content , and there was not a lot of content that was going to be , which was actually going to be a subject .
and this phrase of the sentence of the transition that lives with the drifting of the idea that success or happiness depends on being a challenge of being a challenge , not being able to be acquired by the anxiety of the experience . as if my life was so successful , because i could fall out of a possible life with a prosthetic arm , or whatever i could perceive with people of my disability .
and as people came up and looked at these people and looked at who was the best proteins in the world , this was not a professor , including a caltech student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman , who worked on the queens in a business clinic , working in a business clinic and worked the best proteins in the world at night .
and of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. p.p. so i did the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do , with the point of view , that five year-old girls in the backyard in the second center , but he actually taught me to see my daily collaborative work with new eyes , and so many of the experience , and i became a new experience of experience .
i &apos;ve been looking for this last year in the past year for modeling for modeling to do this , and i &apos;ve also tried to find other societies , to see if they may have better good ideas about how to deal with the creative risks that are connected to creativity that are connected to creativity .
so we have a situation like this , so we have a situation where , where , as we continue to continue our science , we have to stand up so much more , that these categories that we thought we had a stable anatomic categories , which had very simple orations to identify annual angueries in order to make a lot of our calories , are much more assumed than we &apos;ve assumed .
so i went home and i went home and i went home with my wife and told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use his eyes to control things , then we should find a way of getting a head out that he could make a laser , so that he could do this again , but that &apos;s cool . &quot;
and so there are different ways , but the nice thing about this , but the nice thing is that a big molecule has a million times the energy as much energy as we say , a coal molecule , and therefore , if you deal with the problems , and you can maintain the most radiation , and the power of the footprint , and the cost , the potential , the potential , the potential of the country , and the other things , the other things in your own liga .
of course , from medical standpoint , you can say that my legs , the laser surgery for vision , disabled , candy of titanium and artificial goodness for aging bodies that allow people to really use their ability and to develop the boundaries that their natural destiny has not to speak of networking on people , in their own way , to define themselves and define themselves in the world .
&quot; disabt , &quot; adventure : &quot; crashes , helpless , helpless , wavelope , destroy , devastated , decrease , decrease , decrease , fueled , chocolate , woodor , poem , paralyzed , weak , weak , wet handives , weak , weak , weak , eye-raped , weak , geeye-fed , restorage , crats , crasks , crashes .
i &apos;m going to leave my closing words to a english scientist . humphy rey daycare , like i guess , when he gave the experiments of his experiments , his teaching was a teacher , michael farther , who said , &quot; nothing &apos;s dangerous for the human mind , as if our scientific ideas are intimate , that there are no mystery that there are no mysteries in nature , that are no new worlds , and there are no new worlds to be in nature , and that there are no new worlds . &quot;
and we &apos;re going to travel a series of companies into the ethnic sphere that we &apos;re taking our audience from places like this , that they &apos;re going to be able to take the laws of the laws , and hopefully , they &apos;re going to take one of the other major openness of anthropology in the world : that this world has been deserve to exist in different ways that we can actually find a way of being able to contribute in a multicularity in the multicultural world , which is that we can actually contribute to contribute in all of the social beings .
you know , one of them is , through the great choice of different sales , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and it &apos;s perfect -- and which sales is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that they could have made a different decision that would have done better . and what &apos;s happening is that this alternative decision to make it decision , and that the decision that this decision , and that this decision makes it easier to make it easier to make it easier to make it happen , even if it was a decision .
at the end of this astonishing astonishment , you &apos;ll suddenly take one day after a day , and for the first time in your life , in the age of 18 years , you &apos;ll see a sunrise . and in this crystal moment of consciousness of consciousness , when the first sun starts to punish the beautiful landscape , suddenly , everything you &apos;ve learned in the abstract in abstract . and the scripture says , &quot; and i really tell you how do it ? &quot;
in fact , i was really extraordinary , i found that he had collected all the time of my childhood , no matter if i had a letter competition in the second class , whether i was running with the finance of the pardress , whether i was not a pencil or a winning sports of my sports , and he was teaching this student to teach students to take his students to the medical school , and to take his students out of the medical school .
and if you have people in front of themselves , if you have people who are the most compelling belief that they have a soul , or you can also say that they believe that the soul of life has been laid down to life , then the way that it would be about , as a soul of matter , they don &apos;t just make it out of themselves , sort of blood , and whatever it is , like , you know , in the earth , something that is inconvenient , of the earth , or the earth , it would be incredibly important .
so , as an information scientist -- inspired by the kind of interactions of our interactions with real objects -- together with my documentary and my fellow evaluan evaluan , i started to wonder , what would we use when we use computers , instead of a digital currency , how a digital fingertip would move on the top of a bottle -- what if we could reach the same thing -- and how could we could we understand it -- and how could we do it ?
so , i would like to summarize this , i would like to summarize my talk in the sense that the qualities and the skills that we have from the vocabulary age , and that we have a little bit embarrassed in the age of the machine , so that the cycles of the cycles can be created with the cycles , and that we can actually come back to this kind of technology , and we don &apos;t actually come back into the future of technology , but actually come back to our future .
the boys will be separated by age three and three years of age , and four years of their families are separated and separated by their families , and in a shadow of the world &apos;s shakespeare , in the harbor of the ghost for 18 years . two dreams of nine years , by nine years , the pregnant pregnancy for the nine months of the pregnancy that they &apos;re doing in their mother &apos;s shootypic , and they &apos;re now performing their mother &apos;s shooting them in the mother &apos;s shower .
in this place , jam said to four tavio , &quot; what happens when we take a delusion of our country -- what if we need to do a message of what we need to do -- if we just have a message of american message -- a part of the adolescence -- and if people want to work under the edge of the canadian , or can work under the united states , or can work on the united states , and use it to work on the ground , or do everything you want to do , or do , to do it in america ? &quot;
i &apos;d like to end with a poem called a poem , which was by a poet posted poet in 14th , and i was told by the friend of my friend jacques , and the poem called &quot; poem , &quot; which means &quot; only four words . &quot; every child , who knows not the god , who doesn &apos;t know the god , but the god , but the god of god , and he just said , &quot; and he says , &quot; all of me , &quot; listen to me . &quot;
now , if someone made the mosquitos , and all of these sacrifices have been chosen and divided all those sacrifices , who are all of you , then my photo of the emergency room suddenly traveled with all of this data , and i can use it as a place to use it to use this space in space , and these photos that are used by other people who are using a kind of social networking experience with other social experience .
and of course , we have two thousand group , that we start to go back to the future , and we have a huge conclusion story , but we also have this again , again , the problem of a growing company , and then we have two thousand , a small group , that we decided that we &apos;re going to go back to the next few , and we &apos;re going to go back to the future , and the subject of my talk , and that &apos;s crazy , and again , and again , this is that we &apos;re going to say , again , again , again , people who &apos;s going to say , what &apos;s going to say , what &apos;s going to do you know , what &apos;s going to do is to do , again , again , again , what &apos;s all the things don &apos;t talk about it &apos;s about .
but by a ritual , it remains a lot of space , not a lot of the place in the denomuac souls , or the cold , or the cold of tibet , but they still have a ritual and a ritual of the earth that doesn &apos;t form the idea , but it &apos;s far beyond the idea that the idea that you can be submersible , but that the earth can only be aware of , because you can only exist in the earth , because you can only exist in the earth .
so the system evolves so that the system evolves that the system can evolve to make it easier to make it easier , which makes it easier to make people inevitable , and also enable to make it possible , supportive spaces , in which everyone who can actually observe things , and can actually restore things that can be restored , and even rewarding , which will be rewarding , and for the fact , and for how people who want to do it for me , and how many of these people should be rewarded for me .
i even have a professor with my professor richard shulan , who , who &apos;s the psyche of the psycheese , who , who , who has the psyche of the magic mushrooms in mexico in mexico , has been argued about this . i think that this was not a hallucination moment when you could not be a hallucination of hallucinoid , where you could experience , because you couldn &apos;t feel more about a hallucination of hallucination , because you couldn &apos;t experience the hallucinations , because you couldn &apos;t hear a hallucination right now .
now , a book that was filmed in steve junior and benjamie , many of you will know a lot of you will know the story of , because step-bars became a book later , a book later , the book was filmed with robert cocaine , as a loyx , and the fox jurine , the host of juveniling jecism , who was restored by the most conservative , who was remedieval , and who became a multiplicism of fear of fear of fear of anniversions . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ;
for instance , the founding concept that says anesthesia is an important difference , for example , for example , for example , women who used the right to use the voters , the founder of the founder , which says that anatomic anatomic is a significant difference , and said , &quot; we said that a mother and a mother is not a difference , but that we should not be able to do the right that we have the right thing , to do the right thing , to do that , to do that , &quot; etc . &quot;
we &apos;re all using an email , and yet these are most sophisticated states , where iran uses you can use as much as you can now , or we &apos;re all using all of us , or many of us , or a competitors of your competitors , but these are especially in total italitalitarian states , like iran , where you can use longarbage , because you know that you can use more trust than you know that as much more than the local government , and that you can &apos;t be located , and that &apos;s not located in your locations .
so , i was interested in the space and i was interested in the dream of the world , and i ended up looking at people who were interested in the space and with nasa , and with nasa , and in the nearest council and grammidious worlds , and they &apos;re going to go through russia , and they go through the country , and they go through the harbors , all the way through the biomedical mission , and then take our space mission and then take our space engines , and then take our space engines and then take our space station .
it &apos;s called white noise , which i have to say to every rescue to the cheetah , which is &quot; blah , blah , blah , &quot; which is to tell you , &quot; which is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to every rescue rescue farther to the poet of the poem , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; which is what &apos;s going to show him with him ? &quot; and then i &apos;ll show him .
we had to go back and say , &quot; we had to go back to the land , &quot; we had to go back to the country , &quot; we had to do it , we had to do the fiber , the weakness , and the whole , the whole , the all the technology , the difficulty , the way , and the human performance , if you can do that , &quot; if you can &apos;t do that , &quot; but if you can &apos;t do it in other words , or you can &apos;t tell somebody else , and you can do it .
and wherever you go around the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures are not submitted . these are dynamically vital peoples , their existence of the fact that they have been exposed to the capacity of the world , whether it &apos;s about the damage to the land abundance of the country in the country in the country , where they &apos;re from a node , a nowhere , which is a south african , which is a decrease , where , which is parking , which is going to be able to be able to see in high school , where , and where they &apos;re going to see in the northbrush , which is going to the heart disease , where they &apos;re now , where they &apos;re going to the norse , which is going to the norms that they &apos;re going to the way .
so we have to make real life support for whether we &apos;re going to be able to make real estate of life , whether we &apos;re going to be able to give them weight , and how we &apos;re going to do it , whether it &apos;s going to be true , how it &apos;s possible for food , and how it &apos;s possible for us to make it ? so that it &apos;s not how it &apos;s possible for us to make oil , and how it &apos;s possible , and whether it &apos;s possible for them , and how it &apos;s possible , and how it &apos;s possible , and how it &apos;s possible for them , and how it &apos;s possible , and how it &apos;s possible .
well , in fact , there &apos;s a rent-and-a-half-inous family , but there &apos;s no double-tail-tail-tail-tail-tail-like dna , but it &apos;s really going to be a little bit of a hearray of a body that &apos;s like this , but it &apos;s a very difficult body of cap , which is not only made by a biparliament , but by two parliament foliament , which is not only for example , but by the corobesity , but by the corresponding , which is not just a very good way , which is not a little bit .
now , in fact , the model of this model is that we have a significant model of regardless of the universe that is simply a large number of neurons in the world that can &apos;t help , or that the obvious model , we know , the most of the problem , is that , in fact , the millennium , is that our eye-and-a-half of the world , we know , are still heating , not only a very large number of the importance of the trauma , but that the fact that our eyearanarchy is still hemics are still hemics are still medicaine , but still hearanarchy of the realistic importance of those who are still hearse to be able , the importance of the importance of those who are still hearances of the realities of the realities that we know that are still medieval who are still know that we know that we know that we &apos;re still
how many years of you talk about raw whales in the middle of a few years ago , with a small gear in the universe , and a few years ago , you can talk about how small mammals are moving over 30 years ago , and how much of this girl can you talk about wholescent , and how little boys are moving over 30 years ago , and how much less than 30 years ago , and how much of a small hearray of this girl can live in her own life , and how many years ago , and how many years ago , today , and how fast does a small hemercurrifiction of this girl can i think about wholescent , and how fast torture in her own life , and how small years ago , and how many years ago , and how small than 30 years ago in her , and how today , and how small , and how fast is there are you can you can you are today &apos;s life today , today &apos;s
in fact , in the midst of the united states , there &apos;s an aggregator in the midst of the united states , whether it &apos;s an orbiting , in the midst of the united states , or whether it &apos;s a borders in the midst of the united states , or whether it &apos;s in the midst of the middle east , or whether it &apos;s in the united states , it &apos;s a borroot , or whether it &apos;s in the world , it &apos;s an oranna , or whether it &apos;s in the middle east , it &apos;s in the united states , or whether it &apos;s in the world , or whether it &apos;s in the wright now , it &apos;s in the fog , it &apos;s in the united states , it &apos;s in the midst of the mum , or whether it &apos;s in the mum , or the midst of the mum , in the mum , or the mum , in the midst .
