seattle ...
i don &apos;t know .
because that &apos;s singing .
but it goes .
don &apos;t find it .
yeah , hello .
we love innovation .
solar technology is ...
that &apos;s not ...
we were poor .
is that all of you ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
after a week .
great trick ?
these were us .
a few less .
and he says ...
we know that .
ta-go !
hold twice .
here it is .
that &apos;s going fast .
they need time .
music as a language .
that &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... not yet .
thank you .
what a fish .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
this is efficient .
wonderful , yeah ?
completely inefficient .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much .
don &apos;t you .
the only opportunity .
no hospital too .
thank you very much .
stephen watts .
three out of 10 .
that was incredible .
thank you . thank you .
yeah , sort of like that .
it &apos;s terrible .
long , yeah .
fantastic , right ?
the sun is going to the sun .
oh my god .
we love entertainment .
we &apos;re going to pick up .
where is it going ?
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we &apos;re losing them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
a lot of stuff .
does that sound good ?
all the environmental discussion .
sounds familiar , what ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
that &apos;s great .
that was fascinating .
can i be honest ?
the farm is incredible .
what did they do ?
robert gupta .
that &apos;s the system .
that &apos;s going on .
yeah , good day .
lento , slowly .
that &apos;s all i &apos;m interested in .
we can do that .
so what do you say ?
not very sustainable .
yeah , milliseconds .
this is our present moment .
they have similar principles .
yeah , good day .
good work ! yes !
just do your job .
this was the result .
thank you very much .
and she did it .
so they meet al .
it &apos;s essential .
they &apos;re all important .
very different term .
immensely exciting .
this is actually me .
it &apos;s nightmare .
yeah , that goes .
flying cats .
this is the last one .
can we change it ?
these days are over .
these guys make money .
what happened here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
add them back .
and that &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know .
centers were built .
what happened here ?
but you know what ?
what was the result ?
i was amazed .
it &apos;s generic .
so they knew everything .
you could see manhattan .
here &apos;s the video .
it has sensors .
why no longer life ?
he opens the door .
a couple more .
that &apos;s very good .
oh , so the one .
there &apos;s no normal bias .
yeah , i know .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
but you know what ?
i have a question .
okay . thank you .
i was faced with him .
players don &apos;t sit around .
so you can do that .
they &apos;re worse . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look .
it doesn &apos;t work .
what do these people need ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i thought about it .
i think it &apos;s interesting .
they use their hands .
so how does this work ?
how they &apos;re interested in it .
that would have been okay .
what are media today ?
you can go in .
so where do we go ?
so it &apos;s true .
how do we know that ?
because you know what ?
it &apos;s not a country .
why do we do that ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
bg : thank you .
this is a wish .
and i was an artist .
let &apos;s call him don .
not school management .
and it &apos;s got to go back .
we can do it differently .
they even do wet .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
an enormous challenge .
there &apos;s no food .
it &apos;s against the justice .
but the wrong things .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
i &apos;m a writer .
here &apos;s another example .
i was treating children .
it feels great .
i swear it .
i wonder .
it &apos;s not going to do it .
thank you very much for listening .
why should we do that ?
thank you .
here &apos;s an example .
you see it immediately .
not toxic in it .
but i kept working on .
or bombs of bombs .
i &apos;m going to go in here .
there are two choices .
we need energy miracle .
why does that happen at all ?
oh . a moment .
i want to tell you .
what do you want to do ?
this is what happens to us today .
and i kept working on .
so she was back .
and that &apos;s how it was .
yeah , here it is .
i &apos;ll agree with you very much .
and why is that ?
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what would everything have to do ?
i mean the soul .
you &apos;re comparing the same thing .
in china , it was different .
luckily , isn &apos;t it ?
but that &apos;s not a protection .
give pee a a chance .
does anyone see something ?
and i always had .
very expensive mobilization .
the people were nuts .
what creates the illusion ?
my gut feeling again .
after just a journey there .
the first one is : constraints .
i created one .
yeah . well , good .
imagine the camera .
jk : both .
but it gets worse .
so here you see it .
thank you very much .
be a mentor .
maybe 10 times as many .
but that didn &apos;t have it .
the data came in .
this is a great question .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
it has billions of them .
did you see these guys ?
but there &apos;s something else .
here &apos;s another example .
is it ever photography ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
ohhhh .
and then it became international .
there were remixes .
let me summarize it .
okay , a few more .
the answer to this is no .
only further . much fun .
my name is amit .
he had the experience .
it keeps you fresh .
this is a great question .
is that your opinion ?
it &apos;s almost identical structure .
and it got better .
that &apos;s what she did .
it really enjoyed him .
here you see the city .
good afternoon , all of them together .
am i going to like color ?
ooh , thank you very much .
some have come and gone .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s more .
dk : 60,000 .
there &apos;s an old study .
don &apos;t be disappointed .
the game is by 2007 .
it &apos;s not for emotions .
it &apos;s called paul offit .
so what did you believe ?
who will make it safe ?
first , we have the population .
i don &apos;t like that question .
but what do your fish eat ?
let &apos;s call it a don &apos;t .
this is preconceptions .
the work of the interpreter .
but where are we useful ?
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
how do we actually work with people ?
... his own story .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
so what does that mean ?
now , what does that mean ?
privacy has to be given .
there are online criminals .
we have three main groups .
it was still fish .
he always showed up here .
and then it happened again .
i felt really good .
and a lot of people forget this .
crisis . death . disaster .
it would be intolerable .
it &apos;s not our fight .
it &apos;s not our problem .
we lost the contact .
why not so much about this ?
we love technology and creativity .
it would be useless .
we &apos;re constantly pushing apart .
and this opens a map .
but what do we do with it ?
that &apos;s about it .
what do i look at ?
his name is tempt .
will it be my size ?
that sounds crazy , right ?
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
we need to spread the message .
you know the most here .
you also have to understand that .
you see that down there .
i want to ask you something .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
i find this fascinating .
i find this fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was destroyed on the floor .
they &apos;re like this .
is it about light ?
i grew up in india .
this is the short-circuit .
you see the water coming in .
i had a good life .
so what happened then ?
who are these relatives ?
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
these changes are in coming in .
what about fitness ?
this is the exciting thing .
but the key is ...
he works with the following .
and then they set it up .
what &apos;s actually happening there ?
the orange doctor .
they really loved it .
but i felt bad .
the two men called me .
woman : overpast technology .
very frightening .
what is the soul ?
we don &apos;t produce more ourselves .
i can say everything .
he went up and down .
what can we do ?
this is what the graphics looked like .
now i get to the end .
maybe that &apos;s the reality of reality .
it may sound like this .
we were twenty-four people .
so we &apos;re too many .
you can &apos;t have a bone .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
or is it possible ?
conflicts emerge creativity .
so what do we have to do ?
they didn &apos;t have books .
that &apos;s felix .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
thank you for your attention .
this was the beginning of the journey .
i &apos;m afraid of awe .
and then everyone went down .
they saw the big impact .
first longer , second .
well , i was the next one .
frankly , who &apos;s normal ?
and finally , episode .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
the same thing , just bigger .
who is the most successful ?
you want to feed the world ?
i wanted to support them .
it &apos;s almost nothing more left .
i only loved two .
one place is south korea .
again , you have it again .
this is such a natural thing .
my wife told me about it .
and how did that feel ?
you can train that to train .
does it make it curious ?
so it &apos;s a circle .
now , what &apos;s hacking ?
this happened to christmas .
what &apos;s the thing for a thing ?
so , you know , you know .
they &apos;d better do it .
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
i don &apos;t have to worry about it !
and that &apos;s nothing at all .
is that reasonable ?
so that &apos;s the good news .
it was a huge success .
so they saw something magical .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
but no problem can be a problem .
they always say , why ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
it was just not invented yet .
conservatives should work yet .
does anyone know what that is ?
for example , this perception of context .
this is a game for outside .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
but it was very sad .
so let me remind you .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
and it &apos;s the x .
sometimes i push too much .
but they get the job done .
they &apos;re connected to these two people .
her mother moved her alone .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
think about your own decisions .
this picture is from this place .
i see this pluscement .
and it took 18 months .
tell me about this world .
this is very risky .
and that worked very well .
again , he showed him four .
i learned everything about it .
and there are hundreds of them .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there &apos;s good news .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
that really made me sad .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
but that &apos;s not so fast .
how can we help you ? &quot;
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
no was never a way of doing it .
the story is not over .
what happened this day ?
well , let &apos;s do this .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
that &apos;s how you feel . &quot;
they come from the artists .
i shouldn &apos;t say that .
the power plant can explode .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
she did it for three years .
you can have these cloud .
the data was not available before .
game is not silly .
now , how could this happen ?
is it all just education ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
so , we can do that as well .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
they don &apos;t have changed the story .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
don &apos;t taste very well .
play doesn &apos;t just play children &apos;s games .
and that was 19 years ago .
which one would you like to enjoy the most ?
they &apos;re creating a epic history .
they have so much uncertainty .
the data continues all the time .
no one &apos;s ever said that before .
so paul is a terrorist .
and that &apos;s what he actually says .
don &apos;t take anything for you .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what should our permission look like ?
this is a lot of volume .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
i &apos;m almost never going to do it .
she was back and forth in die .
and of course , this is incredible .
and here &apos;s the representation again .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
an autistic student .
if it &apos;s the trash right now .
so not like detox .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
we depend on two countries .
everybody needs a goldfish glass .
let &apos;s be saci . &quot;
people were still happy .
it was my first sunday .
he actually collected fish .
my name is brian goldman .
it divides your experiences with other experiences .
the white lines are available for population .
that &apos;s why i made the movie .
he showed up on the algae .
it &apos;s not just technological .
there are four and a half thousand people .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
each case is nutritional .
and so we &apos;re too many .
so the question is : how ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and it was an incredible experience .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
but there are two problems with this .
i started to feel better .
but , you know what ?
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
but that was grandiose .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
that &apos;s it , it &apos;s very simple .
we &apos;re in an area of danger .
and that &apos;s what we did .
basically , they do the same thing .
now , this is one of the images .
what other marks act like this ?
and then something weird happened .
you can play with different kinds of play .
the whole building was made of water .
italy wins . yeah .
on the morning , before the game .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
the creativity had to get out of it somehow .
now , everything is easy to have .
the nurse &apos;s nurse .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
and it starts with a doctor .
i &apos;m going to tell you something .
we use the energy of the sun .
this is all the metadata .
because i can claim everything .
it &apos;s going to be more similar to you .
but slowly it was safe .
it doesn &apos;t work , isn &apos;t it ?
what do you try to do ? &quot;
let &apos;s go further than that .
what lessons do we have learned ?
and the shape plays a role .
you can &apos;t store energy .
then i can translate this whole thing .
okay , that really makes you courage .
once we started a vivid .
my second mistake was worse .
and they get a 257 .
we all love baseball , right ?
somehow , kids don &apos;t do it anymore .
this is about five meters long .
they &apos;re going to be free in the computer .
because does anybody have a mask ?
and then they realize it .
among other things , things should not suffer .
this has the biggest impact .
the movement , to write it .
anyway , not to navigate .
and that &apos;s pretty much the beginning .
the truth is more like this .
do you want to delete jeans with jeans ?
so you can &apos;t do anything like that .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
her family gathered together .
thank you very much for your patience .
we &apos;re a smaller brand name .
what else is still risky ?
just be you who you are .
i remember my first fire .
what &apos;s the story of a story ?
dark is in dark . dark .
i was trying to make a little more exciting .
but quite closely , effective , yes ?
but we need the total .
nuclear leaks , yes ?
this is completely belonging .
let &apos;s leave that quiet .
hmmm , my brand ?
this is scary .
that sounds frightening .
next : nuclear energy .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
i wanted to make sure that was normal at the time .
this is what i &apos;m going to show you .
as soon as the judge saw me .
we can &apos;t just do that .
so i went to the court .
i got something scared of technology .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
and there are several reasons for this .
they sell certificate .
but it &apos;s not documented .
why did i go to medicine ?
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s spreading out .
all adults were aware of the risks .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i like things that are different .
i went to jail -- hard .
this didn &apos;t make any sense in my eyes .
this is a car game , right ?
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
and this video is in real time .
the game begins -- swiss .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
what about longevity ?
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
so the correlation is low .
so , look what happens .
and it really changed the dynamics .
so i just started playing .
and then we said , okay .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
i &apos;m sort of shooting through the head .
have you ever been dispense ?
it &apos;s like learning .
because for me , it &apos;s memory .
how and what does he feel ?
we say in germany .
so you can &apos;t solve this at all .
music is medicine . music changes us .
it turns out it &apos;s really hard .
and you know what i learned ?
these are going to be uncontradicted .
but what will be in the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
it has nothing to do with science .
and this can make a big difference .
but there &apos;s another reason .
anyway , we need a solution .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
so i &apos;m listening , thank you very much .
they flooded the channels .
in the presence of maybe two percent .
we started with it 15 years ago .
how far do you get there ?
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
you know what &apos;s out of it ?
so the first step to a interpretation .
and yet , it &apos;s not a interpretation .
this must be the age of aging .
if you come to this , yes ?
you can show me , i was there .
that &apos;s just the minimum .
we can recover our nutrients .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
on the book and on the image .
this picture reminded me of something .
i find it credible .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but maybe this is not the case .
and what does this mean for the designer ?
i want to prove that to you .
it was a pretty destiny project .
here he is leaving the sun .
this affects the memory .
these rivers take the rivers .
a has these benefits and risks .
our magazines are read by millions .
lego made it for everyone .
privacy doesn &apos;t stand to debate .
they were genetically replaced .
i &apos;m the new doctor .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
baseball is full of great statistics with great statistics .
because we live on a water planet .
do we really want to go to this direction ?
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
and these are the neural structures .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
oh , my time is over ?
something is moving inside of me .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
so we measured his movement .
this is a picture of the object .
apparently , it was pretty popular .
you see something fun here .
i really like to like beautiful clothes .
he can only use his eyes .
but the truth is far away .
you can do it all the time .
so this crazy story could be true .
who would ever wish of a wish ?
the netherlands would have been easy .
her father died shortly after her birth .
for a year , we had no cents .
we need to increase the complexity .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
this is her marked gang .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
but then they really want to go deep inside .
you want to be in the museum ?
this was more to concrete .
okay , do you really want to know that ?
and i had to get out of the city .
we &apos;ve won a couple of prices .
who doesn &apos;t want to healthier children ?
it does light bulb in children .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
no , i mean it really serious .
i &apos;m holding it in my hand .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;ll get my sleeve back .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
we have something that &apos;s not going on .
now i look at greg .
a billion people are going to be hungry today .
do you do that for the children ? &quot;
i loved fish from this fish .
no , no , it &apos;s not going .
and this sounds very different from before .
he was already over chunk .
i started a institute .
they even kill funding with one .
the film hasn &apos;t been done yet .
we need to think about what brands are .
what do you do with this ? &quot;
i call this the battlefield .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 since 1994 .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
this is ideology , not science .
and this taught me so through ...
today , 6.8 billion people .
very simple , that &apos;s how it &apos;s going to come .
it &apos;s busy making sense .
the hot projection today .
automatically , he walks to the right thought .
that &apos;s how natural things are .
but it requires a lot of planning .
we can reinvent everything else .
in how we think of north .
and it depends on phosphorus .
it &apos;s often forgotten again .
for longer than those two networks .
the stones are color codes .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
it &apos;s about changing values .
i started with my usual talk .
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
i learned this from my grandmother .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
we didn &apos;t write that app .
and every morning i jump on it .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
they &apos;re very good at it .
what words would you describe ?
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
there &apos;s also the world record .
so , what is the right thing ?
when people were talking about the judgments .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what you are .
the living bears are the spirits .
they gave their blood pressure up .
thank you , but the best part is coming .
we &apos;ve reached a species of equilibrium .
happiness productivity . fantastic !
the result of this was catastrophic .
and everybody in this room has to be in .
here &apos;s the olive oil .
bjn sundant .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
&quot; risk is not a simple game .
in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
we &apos;ve run a lot of procedures .
this might be public transmitting .
my brother was staring at me .
these are the apas saras .
i talked a lot about magic .
who could have it all ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who do you actually want to inform it ?
completely at a destined goal .
what do you think happens next ?
they have . they always have .
so this is a tough coat .
it &apos;s much more powerful .
they literally put up the levers .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
especially if he &apos;s already died .
so it &apos;s going to create two circles .
the side product is clean water .
it sounds basically unusual , it sounds unusual .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you always lose rare animals .
she &apos;s going to touch her weight .
he died , broken through the story .
here you can see how the building works .
they were drilling through each other .
tell you what you feel .
the other one had a strong diarrhea .
let &apos;s make a little trailer .
so here you have this little mechanism .
there he &apos;s been reporting .
it &apos;s interested in firefications .
the question is , what &apos;s coming ?
the students are divided into grades .
these things are logical correct .
and this is where you feel it .
so for energy , this is a piece of mine .
i tried to understand them .
all these generations need a few milliseconds .
and it turns out that no one seems to get into the rain .
that i had written these crazy things .
so these guys can &apos;t be gay .
this is just a little less destroying .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn to learn .
it &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
a dalmatina , exactly .
you &apos;ll see it first from the back to the front .
so from the modern in the computer society .
and that &apos;s what they do .
we have to get far , and quickly .
it &apos;s about a new supply of america .
they &apos;re all embarrassed questions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they are the healthier countries of somebody .
we &apos;re going through initiating rituals .
now look at this curve .
jokes just belong to our lives .
i was treating people in death cells .
they were inspired to be inspired by this .
leadership may be some mutations .
so scott gets this fruit .
we worked late until the night .
so i followed my gut feeling .
he moved back to silence .
now we saw the reverse effect .
politely all applauded applause .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
so ... means , not that optimistic .
he switches off the bones .
let &apos;s start with the real world .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
they had a concept of blue blood .
i believed , everyone could do that .
i &apos;ve never met him personally .
even cats look at this video .
there was jimmy kimmy .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
how would you describe your brand ?
we talk about cows , fresh .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
i &apos;m a redundant person .
that &apos;s not the route .
this is a painting of a circular painting .
the roof was also covered with water .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
and women argued that successfully .
we can support them to be good .
look at what she &apos;s doing .
the main man will find me to himself .
sexual reproduction is coming to the image .
i &apos;m going to read you the contract .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
that &apos;s the truth . that &apos;s what i believe .
we &apos;re talking about the elderly of it .
it was really immensely profound .
he was shaking his head , no .
this will be happening in april next april .
we also have very detailed data .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
the mechanism comes out of the lie .
but with the right design , please .
we can support them to be good .
to say , what is information ?
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
there was never a time before like this .
and even lomg thinks about it .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
and also , these sources are disruptive .
how will you feed the world ? &quot;
this is an ecological network .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot;
the chef had injured him .
you &apos;re supposed to be boiling .
that &apos;s a trajectory part .
that &apos;s what &apos;s just been shown .
what takes five million milliseconds ?
i see the dalmatina .
it might take , until it is .
maybe we need to have a glimpse of this .
no , no , no , no .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
156 nations send our television channels .
they appointed their internet connection .
but today we are far beyond this one .
she wasn &apos;t drunk .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
this is the system that we live in .
but i kept asking myself to these questions .
and that was what i felt .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
what will these three billion people bring ?
you also want to make a wish to you .
something very strange happens here .
and that was the outbreak of that .
i learned some very simple things .
it can know how we hold it .
so it creates a recovery .
boston has not just a call center .
this is a humble little app .
it comes from one place to another .
&quot; you didn &apos;t let go of it . &quot;
i lived in parallel worlds .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of this .
and i &apos;d like to read you the precaution .
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
you can be logical and intuitive .
tell me a little bit about this part .
make it possible -- you all here .
temple is completely paralyzed today .
does anyone know what that is ?
so this is the reason for this project .
it &apos;s called &quot; i jumble with me . &quot;
let me tell you a little bit about it .
in that way , these things don &apos;t exist .
we &apos;ll come back to these guys later .
we can give ourselves something like this .
so the first exciting primate .
and there &apos;s some sort of staff of staff .
daniel kahneman : sure .
everyone would like to make people happier .
also , the dose plays a role .
and why ? intelligent food changed .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
we now have masses in this country .
not even the truth will be free .
because now you can use a three-sentence .
you see the timeline up there .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
but it &apos;s not just the words .
thank you , danny hneman .
we &apos;re going to get a full flat line .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
because we don &apos;t want to shoot any genes ?
we don &apos;t want firms to have seeds .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t have that much .
they take the process , they understand it .
there &apos;s a lot of things to come together .
and what do you do with the waste ?
bad ? i was completely confused .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and then he can walk away .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
his personal emissions of the silks .
i &apos;m trying to do this for an example .
it has to work first as a present .
but we start to see a change .
this is a year &apos;s exaggeration .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
it &apos;s a little virus of bacteria .
now this level of intuition is very important .
so little-shaking open source .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
they grow five centimeters .
maybe i did it with guinea reason .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
let &apos;s take something else out there .
it &apos;s all coming out of our own pockets .
ordinary people are not accessible . &quot;
so as an artist , i think , is very important .
here you see roberto dancing .
and no , italy won the end .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
but the game is a formal transformation .
thank you . i have a question for you .
he had had had 20 minutes of the music .
now , i &apos;m going to show you .
that &apos;s just a way of insurance .
it should contain the two elements .
shake the environment , make less waste .
but i &apos;m going to talk about that in a minute .
yeah . you &apos;re not doing anything else .
the goal of the film is transparency .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it was a tent barrier .
what you need is a new medical culture .
alone , complain and without support .
do you want to come in and listen ? &quot;
i think our identity is threatened .
a lot of my mandarin is very young .
my cousins all over the place .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
here &apos;s two different dirty papers .
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i &apos;ve got it on my laptop here . &quot;
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artists directly .
it &apos;s a whole cool thing to do .
the difference is perceived as loss .
in two hours , they &apos;re all over the place .
the emergency staff moved all the strands .
no insurance can make yourself more comfortable .
there &apos;s a lot of great books in this topic .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputer .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
you can predict that . why is that ?
what kind of application do i do ?
it &apos;s great that this number rises .
isn &apos;t that half or a quarter ? &quot;
so what can we get out of all this ?
so basically , a translation of translation .
no tree is carbon neutral .
and so on , now you &apos;re always seeing him .
the next step is now in this communities .
he had uploaded a lot of natural history videos .
this is just the labor force .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so , he &apos;s here . exactly .
that really solves the fuel problem .
and ecologically it was a disaster .
this is one , part of it .
it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
in other areas -- the world of communication .
this is my supermarket . no big deal .
but western governments also help themselves .
sleeping lack is ubiquitous .
i &apos;m going to tire , like all of us .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
if you burn coal , no .
say , there &apos;s no prediction .
can you even play it in blue ?
no , we realize what &apos;s inside .
and there &apos;s a central point here .
right ? everybody &apos;s eaten .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
now , what are the archaic models ?
and the list can be implemented .
so , that was my primary motivation .
if you look at america , you &apos;ll find more .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we asked around , and nobody knew it .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
monday : color is something more powerful .
it has a certain number of sales .
and then it looks like this in the rule .
remember the wind still remember ?
so let me help you do a little bit of it .
imagine mozart &apos;s kind of efficient .
i &apos;m happy to say i &apos;m there .
the hydrogen is expanding .
they worry about that , let &apos;s face it .
man 3 : i &apos;m the shadow guy .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a lippy pen .
now , intact has evolved the instruments .
i want to tell you a little bit about that .
actually , not wanted to make a viral video .
in this three-second sentence , three sentences come .
three times , you know it from school .
you can zoom in and zoom in .
now i &apos;m adding a bass .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
if not , squawks today , somebody else .
this is the machine under the genesis .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
she layers more than her does .
your problem is you have a little bit too small .
third , escalation of expectation .
the official dogma of what ?
you just listen to it , and you start talking .
let me show you how they work .
it &apos;s a game called &quot; follow . &quot;
i call them &quot; the income billion . &quot;
we think of energy today .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
you go around and you feel free .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
that means something that &apos;s built in the city .
second time . end of the normal game time .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
imagine that just for a moment .
raise your hands . let me see you .
maybe we can see drilling as a change .
dummerist is not much better .
people were fighting . people were fighting .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
you know that science is not a company .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so , that really blew me around .
i tried to preserve the body .
life hasn &apos;t changed since centuries .
but that &apos;s how many people got over the years .
my grandmother never forgot me alive .
my fourth technology : predicting complexity for complexity .
the third technology : categorization .
it &apos;s called a thousand square kilometers .
you get on two -- very simple .
you should tell me something about my brand .
it was something that we knew we had to do .
but reality is always unpredictable .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
donate thursday : confidence is the key .
it &apos;s in the back of our body .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
i wanted to restore the health of a disease .
now , if you think about a piece of paper .
what ? that really blew me out .
we reject intelligent foods .
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
we have them forced . puff .
my parents are the 80 on the holidays .
and there &apos;s the shifting problem .
it &apos;s the most powerful human feature .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning &quot; in information .
you can jump directly to a particular output .
you can dive into a particular year .
because that &apos;s a matter of evidence , right ?
shake the environment , less energy .
this is called the osit-based model .
now you see the dalmatina .
and the two main ones are here today .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
this has to be down , down to zero .
i didn &apos;t let me discourage .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
and over time , you can react to it again .
our goal was to just say , okay .
and yes , i &apos;ll go back one more time .
everything is comcompound of it .
it &apos;s all that &apos;s useful .
this will be balanced in china at a second .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
anyway , they do it in the middle .
the permanent ice is labeled with red .
and if not , they still dance their dance .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
my mother asked us to look at her hand .
seriously -- the bottom line , let &apos;s see !
now , this cartoon does some of the things .
here &apos;s a couple of on the hampton .
so this is how the supermarket is .
i thought i could integrate myself .
we still think they &apos;re originally primarily .
the three words laugh : remember ?
i remember it was yesterday .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
now , i cheat the court .
i said , &quot; ok , oma . &quot;
we are in the middle of this transition .
i work in the solar technology industry .
and let me show you a simple example .
but it has an unexpected twist .
so that made sense , it fit together .
yet , we seem to be really satisfied with it .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
scott talked about man being human .
and here &apos;s every piece of very good .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
is it about the detail or the colors ?
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
nobody has to give their ideas to light .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
i think i might have heard more hands .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
eeeeeee ! no , thank you !
and that &apos;s a millionaire .
so we need digital security systems .
so again , the most appropriate together .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
internal sexuality comes in a lot of different forms .
so they &apos;re saving ; they &apos;re saving the shoes .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
we &apos;ve been here for 130,000 years .
what we want to do is to create the future .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in the real world .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching .
let me show you about the nearest one .
it &apos;s kind of like a potatoes .
blame . damage . shame .
we &apos;ve gotten rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
they were just like the people in this room .
my grandparents made this number to 70 .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
we need to use it for more research .
that &apos;s where every footprint is .
i would usually take the needle out now .
there &apos;s someone sitting there who had no childhood .
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
let &apos;s do this as if we had a machine .
what happened to these design students ?
this is going to be a key element of this toy .
they live with help from chemosynthesis .
i was totally excited about science , you know .
i &apos;m going to choose the theme of the government .
and every night , they fly 240 kilometers back .
every morning , they fly 240 miles to farm .
what &apos;s the fuzzy ? &quot;
natural light then offers smarter .
that &apos;s how nobody did it in the world .
picasso says , wait for a minute .
we always create new tensions and conflict .
that the issue of ecology is a global .
now i &apos;m going to do something even more powerful stuff .
they &apos;re all back to their way back .
and they had to remove what we did .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we just signed up .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
so you can &apos;t put them wrong together .
what do you do with certificate ?
this is alfred gonzalez .
there can be a consequence of changes .
and this is very important in medical research .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
what would you say to someone who believes this ?
then he whispered me into the ear .
the rest of the time , they &apos;re octasty .
i start with some simple examples .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
the question is , why people accept this .
and i went back to work .
it will be connected by oxygen and silicon .
and we increase our expectations on time .
and then i wonder , how could this happen ?
first of all , i thought that was a game .
the storytelling always needs more senses .
and the whole thing is trying to do with another generation .
today , a lot of people put up the government .
the next week comes to the market .
it has a button , it &apos;s got a button .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the show .
the first one is a classic , apple .
it &apos;s the way i &apos;d like to be .
these things have a more positive impact .
none wanted to do something to do with the movie .
what do you believe how the answer will be ?
on the left-hand side , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s why i think we need to be leaders .
so we have this horrible idea .
so two pairs , every baby .
ladies and gentlemen , their relations .
it &apos;s the only test of survival and success .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
it was ah beyond the imagination .
but the best part comes -- in a second .
so every concert is a different concert .
so it &apos;s not saving , it &apos;s avoiding .
and everything is packaged or content .
i could go right in front of my house . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
they &apos;re supporting others from their mistakes .
i put them and i got into the treatment .
do you know how to call a 4000-person ?
notice two things about this curve .
and i have to say , there were force to me .
my mother was the youngest of her children .
at 16 , i started illustrate books .
that our contribution to the system is voting .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
he hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
i never want to move through something different in life .
so i spoke a few months later on a conference .
this is how they communicate -- this is how their fingers walk .
i want to show you a little bit of a little bit here .
and of course , it &apos;s made but it &apos;s made .
it was summer , and i had exposure to it .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
and they &apos;re not just going to die of masses .
what happened is that we could do that .
they don &apos;t invest any time in power .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . i put it on .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
anyway , that &apos;s what i want to do in any case .
technical circle gives it the same .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge to nine .
i made it particularly upset .
at the beginning , the tribal society is through language .
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
so you &apos;re supposed to add from the outside to the people .
we don &apos;t invent identity ; we invent it .
it was a lot of los and i got into the eggs .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
now everybody &apos;s trying to figure out something about this pattern .
he came to me and hugged me .
all the ones that were like this started to divide up .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you make it crazy ?
the country over the country would roll them up .
so smartphone , a huge issue all over the place .
and we want to make this material available for everybody .
i learned very simple things in my work .
we want to do something against death penalty companies .
there &apos;s a couple of interesting developments there .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet , a realistic level has been realistic .
so the theme of the day : save money .
in fact , no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
and we need to improve much more on this device .
it emerged about four and a half years ago in italy .
and i &apos;m saying that this is good .
this is a problem that many players have .
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve been summarized .
so instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
memory off that , trigger the rest .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
well , what &apos;s the brand of marry ?
i want to help you calm down .
both of them are capable of survival , both of them .
as i said , amanda wearing our elephant .
there were no canvas melting .
have you taken all your vitamins ?
so this was a highly curious experience .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
it &apos;s all these wind blows around , almost virtually .
information is a difference that makes a difference .
the only thing they had was their head .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
this is a dead turtle .
so i think this is my brand .
i have something i want to show you .
how about living in good health ?
we don &apos;t want companies to patent life .
and that &apos;s what i thought was so exciting .
they have the flow of the water .
so , we can &apos;t even do these things .
in the countries where people are coming to money .
and how does it look like that in there ?
we understood that the weather is global .
and in this head , the memories are reduced .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news for you .
this is a totally unsustainable development pattern .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is gone away .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
there seems to be a disagreement .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 1,000 years .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
now they understood the advantage of the prototyping .
that &apos;s the u.s. for hundreds of years .
i think the first place is curiosity .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
these were the very first calculations of six years ago .
but maybe you can also agree about it .
but today we &apos;re only talking about the biological systems .
not anything , of course , will be comedible .
if you fall in love , efficient ?
and we see that it &apos;s going through .
because we don &apos;t feel real money .
yeah , so what to be biohacking ?
here &apos;s a couple of people that test it .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
there &apos;s the ones that are much more spatial .
the headquarters headquarters are right here .
i thought he would have kidney rocks .
and installing my doctor to my doctor .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones as well .
we want to reduce the number of crops .
the swiss is oconcrete .
the decrease of dna was an interesting step .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
but what happened to the other day is different .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the label .
no apple &apos;s ever slept again .
good night , sweet rat . &quot;
now he gets a tractor to the scene .
and you &apos;re also feeling your movements and your movements .
when your job is dance , they dance .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
these are footage about a six seconds .
but netherlands is not always such a bad thing .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
they &apos;re going to be rare because we &apos;re going to catch them .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of the animals .
all of these are errors of unavoidable .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
i remember if it was yesterday .
and from me , a figure is going to be in the book .
tell me , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
so every droplet was a little bit different .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
i put my job at 95 .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
we found that it actually moves very strange .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
the answer is likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
do you know how many people look at this tedtalks ?
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
that &apos;s something like our fight .
that &apos;s how you can raise the whole movement .
here are the results that we &apos;ve just gotten .
but how do you do that in practice ?
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
i don &apos;t want to do it by not getting stars . &quot;
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
that &apos;s not how happy a person lives .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
that also , the dose is a role of play .
probably a lot of you know about this in the hall here .
yes , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s raise that .
and i have all kinds of little things here .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
now , i understand that . that &apos;s what i do .
the marshmallow needs to be up on top .
it &apos;s really , really important that we get there .
now let &apos;s think about how to measure our success .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
these blocks give us no money .
i can run the sequence as it walks around .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
for nathaniel , music means elite health .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
because , in fact , this human being is not interested in this human being .
because we can &apos;t live without this lifespan .
he just fails them and not himself .
why do i have to afford this little car ?
a phrase with its own attitude .
the interpretation of interpretation is barely talking about in the beginnings .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
it &apos;s kind of like a compound of mind .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say that .
or they didn &apos;t have a photo togray .
and all of this leads to a big question ...
they virtualize the reality , and they don &apos;t have computers .
yeah , what do we do for projects now ?
and the world that we lived in was this way .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
if you generalize it , this is what happens .
and that was not hard to end diagnosis .
i was a twenty-obsessive student .
well , really good , maybe a star star .
wealth , not debt , affecting the outcome .
she had the last word in every family arguments .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we use this word with such tempting .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and that worked . applause for scott .
i met the decision in the united states .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times viewed .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
or are you more likely to be a pure tribe ?
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
so what are we going to see in the movie ?
you know , i had the idea of a movie .
i want to tell you how we found that .
and this is the planning behind xic .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
you see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
it &apos;s natteries , and it &apos;s just nataky .
we have the passion of a poet innovators .
this is moore &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
we want to create mass intides . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i want to talk about the power of identity .
now we &apos;re doing this with drills and machines .
this is the call center for service and information .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
we all have navigation systems in our cars .
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
all right , let me show you a little bit more of it .
here we were , and this is the painting .
emc : &quot; welcome to welcome transparency
there was a lot of crazy things going on .
from the bird era to the machine age .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same with the disabled movement .
but will we make the best part of our toys ?
8,000 gamers played the game for eight weeks .
so we have 1.5 billion player on this .
you would expect an additional billion player in the next decade .
but one of them is clearly worse than the other one .
but do you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
i thought we were going to use the poker .
there is a connection , a mutual respect .
and so i then met a little unusual decision .
so my two passions flew in .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
i don &apos;t know who of you know this picture .
i &apos;ll just agree with that , that &apos;s logical .
it seems to me that it seems to contemplate both .
the question of death penalty is an interesting question .
the child in me is really excited about this opportunity .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
today i &apos;m going to report by unexpected discoveries .
the underwater part comes from a quarter .
when i say reality , i mean photoreality .
at the moment , we are far away from this goal .
and how was that for them ? what is it successful ?
a little bit more about you , that &apos;s not you .
it was in eternity , forever .
tuesday : customization is totally overrated .
the dog ! i was linguistic .
would you like to be attracted and self-conscious ?
she was hardly hardly hardly and was blue .
people in the side rooms now come in .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
you need that , and we don &apos;t give it to you .
and some of them doesn &apos;t work , and some people don &apos;t .
so we &apos;re walking before , and where do we go ?
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace it .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
we wanted to develop a learning tool for language learning .
i might have another 40 years of work in me .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
if you want to create hyperlinks between the left .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not perceived as a huge loss .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
this is the kind of eduardo shame .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies .
we learn to trust and play the rules of the game .
probably one of those numbers must come close to zero .
and i said , &quot; yeah , very much . &quot;
you can say things that have influence in the world .
... can you just show the slide , please .
just like , i think we &apos;re going to play a game today .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the need doctor &apos;s need .
and i went over and just heard .
it also shows up to other places of the book .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
these results were reached through several weeks of hard work .
this player is just about a episode in front of a episode .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
there &apos;s a program that maybe some people know .
i &apos;m very grateful for the receive here .
you know , he was 35 here in 1835 .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of it yet .
my mother suffered from the boat .
these are the people who see my world forms .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to him anymore .
we see this in all kinds of human life .
and the same thing was after the three months .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent .
the main problem here is just like aids .
the logic doesn &apos;t say anything about reality .
have a nice example of concrete example .
and then i say , heart sorry , yes ?
and we &apos;re often reinventing how often we want .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing kids to the world .
his whole business process has changed after that .
i said , &quot; promising , oma . &quot;
it &apos;s distorted and curious programs .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
but that , what this picture is , is a problem .
there are some places we can apply to .
we called it the digital pavilion .
because they have special skills of processing .
so here &apos;s a couple of natural light bulbs .
the second factor is the services we use .
and that changed my way of making films completely , completely .
it &apos;s hard to overcome the destruction .
so you could feel like you could sell him .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
that means that ants weigh much more than we do .
and we can look at that now .
geh and jellyfish cohen .
so , they pull off and they start inventing it .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
that &apos;s an idea that spreads itself to spread .
so just imagine two other little changes .
how many people would choose to choose a good memory ?
and that &apos;s what &apos;s like , the message .
so please listen to , if music is played .
so , you don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any statement about what &apos;s going on .
the first two sentences that are logical .
we actually know that something else is the case .
now this should be not a joke , but it should be .
do that once , and then you learn the sentence .
we can do these things in different examples .
what we love with is that it &apos;s a cardiac creature .
they moved to a natural alistic concept .
so these women met , and they just got down .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and we &apos;ve created an ipad app .
darwines and sponsors were sponsored .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzle pieces .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you zoomed in . you can actually go inside .
you can see in all these museums here .
how much money is needed to realize that ?
think about it . this attack is generic .
and if not , then stupixnet does nothing .
so we start with a wind drank .
he says , &quot; make up the boxes . &quot;
imagine a sound airplane on the plane .
it &apos;s a totally denial of error .
the first one is that we &apos;re not going to continue to evolve .
this is another look at the tree of life .
they divided the kingdom into two .
this is one of the classic expressions in playing .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
we didn &apos;t have a child paralysis in this country yesterday .
and i used to take a while to figure that out .
we repeated these practices with the same student .
you have to be willing to take risks like this .
&quot; look at your stomach , pink .
there &apos;s no overpopulation problem with trees .
then you &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s given a change .
and the third area that actually explains itself .
i &apos;m looking forward to the conversations with them all !
every big picture is the beginning of a section .
you wouldn &apos;t like starvation , and you know what ?
or are you more like a downstairs ?
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
this is the consequence that we need to face .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i said , &quot; please fly in the air . &quot;
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
game is the tip that holds us together .
if you have something to give , you &apos;ll have it now .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
they teach them to be able to open themselves .
onymous : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
and here are two patients . these are their records .
i mean , this is a real cognitive use .
i think that &apos;s true for every human on the planet .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
so , climate change is going to be terrible for you .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
clean coal , you heard a lot about it .
but the volume are significantly larger than ever before .
it grows in winter and shrinking in summer .
not only bad , but the worst ever .
everybody knew , you know , your genius was a little bit neck .
we condense them , repaired them .
and the world we live in now is looking like this .
but these are all roads in the u.s.a .
we dance in the temple and we become god . &quot;
child mortality has reduced to a tenth .
that &apos;s also because that &apos;s coming back .
ok , this is something that is half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s not an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
we walk into the arms of the placebo industry .
in nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
where &apos;s the greatest interest , what &apos;s really going on ?
and also , the energy supply for them is very important .
we returned to the tick of titanic .
because artists have a broken relationship to the lie .
and at all , you know , you &apos;re much less than me .
or b , because you don &apos;t have learned to sing ?
i &apos;m never going to play as it is in this moment .
it &apos;s the form of reform , yes ?
and less user or friendly friendly is it .
how can i make something usable ?
i don &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
so how do we work if we were in there ?
each society is prevented by a primary medium .
and these interactive portraits are true to each other .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fuels of the fourth generation .
you may have heard that we built the sign .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
you get a model that comes out of the whole earth .
the grandfather of this old manager to refuse .
and she said the three words : do you mind ?
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
so in other words , i first want to know what i want .
and i see the same process in combining photos .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
it was viewed in nearly 200 million times this year .
they had 348 different kinds of march .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
he described one of them as &quot; very ordinary . &quot;
it was developed at the university of washington seattle in seattle .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
on a feet , the screen is filled with leaves .
so the tasmanian movement has done it .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
this year , it was taken almost 50 million times .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
i want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
we should put the bear in the cage .
are you aisles and monn , like 2,000 ?
the living self has no voice in this election .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
and in the world , everything was made sense for me .
well the next day we were in cleveland .
zip , in a moment , the headphone .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
and no , it &apos;s not comfortable or san francisco .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open them doors ?
here &apos;s the recent version of this trajectory .
it was a extreme situation . you needed a extreme solution .
and they were kind of the first of people of developed play devices .
as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
you never get a job that you can &apos;t solve .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen rarely flat lines .
i &apos;m going to take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
and the movie is called &quot; the cooperative host . &quot;
now , in this area , there are not several thousand goals .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines here .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
well , we &apos;ve introduced the mayor hole .
now , nowadays , we know all about where our things come from .
france makes a rich . italy makes a tor .
how do you judge people based on their character ?
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressive vity .
it &apos;s a five-pound hope of hope for my consciousness .
is it for other yellow or is it possible for us ?
so i say , let &apos;s start the world changing games !
edward caber is a voloid scientist .
now we spend three hours a week playing with online games .
the biggest difference between them is the transition with time .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
bg : a energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
and i say , &quot; shake you yourself .
so with a pigeon , you can dive into a decade .
but for a lot of people , that &apos;s a little bit radical .
so i went to my life with a lot of fish .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
in fact , the notes are very veiling and unprecedented .
because we don &apos;t make things free anymore .
that &apos;s where it &apos;s going to be more like my glasses .
as i said , it just started .
this is an interactive trickster .
and emotions ! in spite of all of you , for those of you .
i &apos;ll keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and everybody knew it worked that way , right ?
i would prefer to do this work that i love .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
here &apos;s , &quot; put your fingers on any light . &quot;
the next step was to find the apps for that .
we still know where all the gas stations are .
so you &apos;re just going to go to google projet.com .
what other metamorphobians have gone through ?
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other marks .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money trying to see great .
this constant feedback is not true in real life .
i &apos;m going to take it out , and then explain it .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
a semester on the subject of design interface .
i &apos;m also going to resolve what &apos;s in there .
you don &apos;t know anything in this goldfish glass . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great dunes .
in the future , most crime are going to play online .
we had no words for what we started out there .
now he &apos;s on the red list of dangerous ways .
30 years ago , this would be ridiculous .
but i really believe that after us , something is going on .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
the cellular communities began to abstract information again .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital physical thing .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacine rat .
&quot; don &apos;t go , &quot; it turns out to be true .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the brick .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s going to be put together .
also urban designer and -building is very interested .
there &apos;s not even him online . no extension .
this doesn &apos;t work at all for memory itself .
our steps at the digitization of life were exponentially .
this is star night , probably never seen it before .
over the course of that discoveries , i learned a lot .
when i was a kid , i was drawing comic books and so on .
if we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
that &apos;s now the real thing that our goal is to do .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
we were only around like this , as we were .
a lot of speaking to 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
i was quite obsessed with exploring the deep ocean .
so if sound says , there &apos;s no soul .
by the way , this is the hardest part of my talk .
i can &apos;t play as much as in 20 years .
both cases gave me , ask me questions .
so much testosterone , but no reaction to that .
so the growth rate is accelerating itself .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my head .
1m is the highest what i saw .
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the goal ?
that &apos;s why from the weighs on how to think .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
now , how do people die in a consequence of a hack ?
the first story of charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle there .
i sold all the animals around the country , all around the world .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can turn that around .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio knew that , but it didn &apos;t .
no , that &apos;s what the right thing is , right ?
many of you are covered by faces .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
in both cases , operated , and they did well .
she didn &apos;t have a treatable brain damage .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
and the fish also had the fortune to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
it was the eradicate dispute against drugs .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
there &apos;s more of this behind it , it &apos;s still deeper .
but we just know a little bit about where things go .
ok , imagine the way extreme self-motivating .
i know what people think when they see this .
ask , ask the evidence , demand it , demand it .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
this is how it used to happen on the village .
this is what happened in the way of using machine age .
so , in general , there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
they put it in the beaters machine .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental recovery .
it could be happening within a newspaper learning framework .
... it &apos;s the crowdsource of crowdsource .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
i worked in a coal mining station -- dangerous .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there he was drunk , and he was like , right ?
that means that it &apos;s going to go back to the crime .
so how does a human with certain kinds of things happen .
and of course , as design takes place to perception .
but for the two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious mental .
lawyer : i &apos;m a lawyer .
we have a abstract abstract language .
another example is called the so-called virtual reality .
but it was actually a big fun night in this night .
we had to worry about the lawyers and the lawyers .
it was called the automatic stone stone block .
rotar is a certificate point .
well , because you don &apos;t know that it was different .
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to raise ?
he took a famous photo . how did it mean ?
they &apos;re slowing down for one of our big problems .
we see the process that feeds itself .
thylacines ? yes . living ? yours .
here &apos;s a short video of what we &apos;re doing .
but you can combine something special like this .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
because the images of food you recommend .
on the other hand , and around , you &apos;re in this museum .
the idea is to translate a digital security system .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i &apos;ll explain it .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
in fact , the advanced society is based on energy progress .
this was not a movie , no hd , this was real .
i wasn &apos;t there a long time ago with miguel .
because you know , this is a fun process .
have you ever seen a maneuverable tree ?
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i just described .
if you want to get far more furniture , go together . &quot;
america &apos;s new america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
frog , the carbon man will be cleaning every day .
this is a organism we described in 1996 .
so i &apos;m going to step back , and i &apos;m going to see another way .
i filmed in war areas -- hard and dangerous .
so we should be able to figure out what the goal is .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
if we make cities , this is actually a big thing .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
in other words , the game is our adaptation .
can you imagine something that comes out of tobacco ?
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds about their pain .
you can just name a couple of names and people will understand .
divine , rocks , child paralysis ...
this is a variant of a thing that was done .
now , the energy source is over time .
and it was an experience that couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
we will show it in the opening sequence of the film .
it took immense jews in the control room .
that &apos;s not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s this kind of pulling , coincidence .
the shrimp eats the phytoplankton .
and so he &apos;s going to admit his old circumstances .
and then there &apos;s a whole bunch of simulations .
but that was not like that in the years .
the musician &apos;s theater is the extension of our body .
he &apos;s only lived for three years .
hey , puma , does it really make you seriously ?
a baby needs to take about six wind .
so i know some of you who haven &apos;t been in .
this is already a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
in 25 years it &apos;s going to be gone from here to here .
it &apos;s like asking someone to break the sun .
please follow me because the circle will come back .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
this is a iconic debate . it has to stop .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of work .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta palma palma .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
bruno giusi : thank you . thank you .
i have a friend who drives a passenger .
it &apos;s not just a nice tapestry .
and because we &apos;re getting older , we &apos;ll get the wind bigger .
that &apos;s the time period where you fall in love .
and even today , we &apos;re still very , very strong of stories .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and the predictions , as you read , are serious .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
and i &apos;m not expecting that this will ever change .
it &apos;s also my great , long love and fascination .
and what i got good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
why do you care about us if we can &apos;t buy us ?
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
a few years ago , i started to develop live on ligads .
they still describe it as untouched .
my grandfather was during the prohibition in prison .
she was a flash , powerful woman , she had effect .
so , in some sense , the technique marks us the technique .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
as you can see , these are not three special pictures .
but what &apos;s the trick that &apos;s going to make it look realistic ?
but what if you want to see the paintbrush ?
but my logical site didn &apos;t like it too .
i just want to say a little bit about salatularity .
blaise , that &apos;s really amazing . heart of happiness .
we &apos;ve also brought little-vidly to design schools .
this is the simulation of the chesapeake bay .
i said , &quot; let &apos;s try to prefer injustice .
my uncle died in alcohol diseases .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also scared .
in fact , we &apos;re also one of these multicellular community .
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
let &apos;s call it the animals , it costs a lot of money .
if one bar is helping others , we strengthen our communities .
ohhhh , wowwwwww !
they always worry that they lose real galleries .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and my talk today is going to depend on these cognitive issues .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called collecting collections .
open up the card , and jump in with a click .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a lot about transparency .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
you could also use ordinary design -- technology to spread .
one of my friends made it -- richard blow .
imagine if you could actually start flying these points .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
these are the kinds of questions that we need to be encountered .
i was fascinated by the elegant and beauty of biology .
and i can tell you , it was an experience .
we need to start changing the real world into a game .
and that &apos;s from an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
i mean , how much do we remember our memories ?
the more money you deserve to be satisfied .
that all of our survival is connected to each individual .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
right , bryan , the judge has a magician .
and yes , i have a job , as you might see .
secondly , the same lighting photos should have the same kind of lighting .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
for example , would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to be .
this is me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of state-of-the-art statements .
and the movie is going to be called &quot; the cooperative host . &quot;
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
just that i think it &apos;s more like him , not true .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy yourself . thank you very much .
but it turns out that this is not all .
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
that &apos;s a lot of tode by masses , 20 an hour .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my death row .
because they are the ones who are experts for flavor .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
i mentioned this to miguel , and he was kidding .
so the paintbrush , the better the system . &quot;
and then i immediately think that &apos;s unfair .
and also what you would think of today in the spirit of mind .
and the oil we &apos;re going to replace through other energy tears .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not going to make it feel comfortable .
like algage -- and other terrible things .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
it was completely excluded that she could fail to fail .
so that &apos;s what got me upright , and i wanted to do more .
and i immediately see a different pattern that &apos;s coming out .
yeah , it looks like this down there is the load of the load .
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
we &apos;ve been using it now in holland about three years .
and if possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the strange things .
i know now that it was the reason of the sea .
and that was the first time i learned this .
i studied the woman printer , and she was breathing in breathtaking .
and all the time i was collecting more and more knowledge .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 if a bat is 300 .
in 2010 , we had just connected to two billion people online .
i tried to say something about our intrinsic system .
and the lighting the way through the rest of the book .
&quot; because they &apos;ve been holding it since tomorrow , &quot; he said .
we have the capital of the techno-philanthropy .
this approach takes everything that we do creative .
since that time , we &apos;ve gotten all kinds of recognition .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone here in this audience .
well , you &apos;re not going to be happier .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
a very concrete wish , that we invent this technology .
here &apos;s a picture of a blast in kentucky .
he &apos;s got an feed of 15 .
i can say the channel is a man .
we &apos;ve moved to something called the avian age .
this is 20 meters above sea level , like greenland .
this is the audience that we finished recently .
somewhere here &apos;s a series of photographs -- here you are .
but you can , but if you &apos;re in a foreign outbreak .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t seem to be more human .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
or do you want to be more powerful , more force .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successfully , even though it belongs to that .
my great-grandparents died when they were 60 .
now , where should we go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
it &apos;s kind of like the suburbs in the suburbs .
and of course , you can never give it to germany . &quot;
one government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
and the more i talked about it , the more i should tell you .
and i celebrate , i cry like a little kid .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all into my tiny suitcase .
if you &apos;re happy , you attract other happy people .
players are social in the spiders of social networks .
how can we translate these feelings from the games into reality ?
that &apos;s how it was made of the same , bad team under the best .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worried .
so people in the west have really thought about creativity .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
one of the things that happened was that the phone was never broken .
depending on its behavior , we can predict the structure and the function of the function .
a few months earlier , and i had just forgotten everything .
even who kills somebody , not just a murderer .
for example , the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
and the next interesting phase of time took about a billion years .
and this video was actually already in january of january .
each of these topics , of course , has many smaller decisions .
there &apos;s a lot of other , but i &apos;m missing the time .
today i want to tell you about circles and openings .
it &apos;s clearly interacting with its environment and your experiences .
you can take your friends and your neighbors . thank you .
you know , there were no mandarin in &apos;s paradise .
yes , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
one thing that &apos;s beautiful about life is not efficient .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is the vision of vision .
i apologize that i have to be so strongly .
secondly , what economists call the tuna east .
and i think that &apos;s what the world looks like .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
so it doesn &apos;t change anything , and yet it changed everything .
we just took the &apos; 7-billion-controlled brand out .
and then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
so , if you can do the lights again .
it was a shop that was dragging dragger .
are you so far ? you see a little nervous .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
the things that are going to be used just to go into technical systems .
so that &apos;s what you see , that doesn &apos;t work .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean coal technology .
they did that by taking the land out .
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
call them the fear welcome . get the risk for welcome .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
there &apos;s only the second best , which is the fire brigade .
you can throw them away where you go and stand .
an amazing bug . one out of nine innocent .
and i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually going to be a rolling polar ice .
this is somebody who &apos;s safe in the remaining four out of 10 .
we usually used to saying that things happen .
i had a 14-year-old , poor young boys as mandarin .
they &apos;re in it , they want to end up to the end of the gangs .
and then people could eat this , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
because this is where the actual governmental work is happening .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what feeds your feet ? &quot;
and then we started negotiating insulting insula .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
i explained what those notes could have .
that &apos;s why you help , ask people a question .
but even our perception of how they deceive us , because we &apos;re also .
and other examples are the ambient systems , smart systems .
how many doors did the house where they live ?
we think it &apos;s clean -- and smells even good .
i believe that , and i feel like we should teach .
and i guess many of you have done this too .
some people were disappointed that it was not a poetry .
i sent them home without talking to my doctor .
the cost of solar energy dropped in the last year by 50 percent .
we need to engage in the machine gallery of government .
there &apos;s a direct retreat for this to be a direct retreat .
the monkey &apos;s flow of software takes a few years into the rule .
and sure , we can find fast food chains .
cats look at cats looking at this video .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
and what &apos;s noticed is that i needed a experts .
it looks pretty much like the old-fashioned language .
i just wish i could see my kids growing up .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
it has moments of life , one after the other .
and i talked to them to finance an expedition .
we &apos;re talking about the fluctuation of information overload .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering engineer .
and that &apos;s the first half of his first year .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
so they pull around and they make art installations like this .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
i was shocked , and i was crying into the inside .
i went home with the emergency department on my way home .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re a bit special . &quot;
i say this because i think identity is very important .
because all these new technologies today are feeding themselves .
because your life depended on whether you did the job .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost out of the eyes .
i knew she came to be there to give up .
today we don &apos;t just find gene to something we do with .
a typical wal-mart today offers 100,000 products .
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical page says .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you is what &apos;s truly amazing .
in the precautionary example , it was about finding detail .
he said he didn &apos;t say that . he &apos;s not going to ask .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with you .
if they were no longer moving , they were buried them .
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
what would you like to have if you could just have one ?
again , what potential do we want to call ?
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own episode .
so , 10,000 hours is an interesting number of reasons .
when we looked at how emotions fall with income .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
there was no christmas trees . we did all that .
and that &apos;s not what we should do . our healthcare system is mics .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
the program that i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
look at miguel &apos;s , farmers like miguel .
you know , from a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals ?
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not so sure .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the photo actually has been put together .
the words , as long as his friends , spotarify his .
and what we found was that there was actually a context in the context .
do you know how many decisions do you make a typical day ?
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
so the driving force behind it is cyber -- superpower .
i didn &apos;t cut me for two years with my wife .
the pilot gave the machine to the hudson river .
the revelation is that death is a part of life .
it keeps us on the distance , and lets us evolve .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
it &apos;s about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
you can see the person who &apos;s wondering what &apos;s going on inside of it .
in most of my activities , i have two hips .
it turns out that dna synthesizing is very difficult .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we think about our future as the foreseeable memories .
now , the memory itself is a storyteller .
what it ruined was the memories of the experience .
we &apos;re going to be in the next few days .
there &apos;s a step-by-step bike there .
this happened . not a team had a stable structure .
a fish break up , but also an avian reserve .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love story .
this first one , which was more like a passionate monkey .
he &apos;s very happy about this , because he &apos;s deceived it .
because music is a language , and language is a language to communicate .
and it &apos;s especially first to ask , what &apos;s the right thing .
but i &apos;ll just make it a little bit more curious .
i started thinking , i should just take the project out .
we can , of course , forget about the waste problem .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of shape here .
if you don &apos;t do that , someone can take it away .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
only to precise newspapers , they have a translation .
if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
so you can ask : how happy is this alive ?
most of you will be completely ignored by remembering the self .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have any consequences .
does a single person die in the audience ever saw somebody on masks ?
it turns out the question is , can you get that up to zero ?
you like to test it after my talk in your immune system .
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum , quite a lot of ideas .
and she asked him , what are you your hobbies ?
so again , in every store , you can get things back .
so the question is , how do we deal with these wind ?
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
so , for example , the environment , the environment , less car .
and the lives in the coastal region of british columbia .
so if i put them together by side , you &apos;ll be interested in the interest .
am i looking at this as if i could write a song ?
she said it was like a thnout of the air .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious to what we need .
and you say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
you put a blue on a green , and you can make light .
but they don &apos;t take the previous loss of loss .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition goes very quickly .
yet we still come to the galapagos islands .
more and more people came in because they were angry .
it was the fear of terror who shaped her life .
but it &apos;s a rather amazing invention when you think about it .
we &apos;ve got a lot of cells that are no longer focused on themselves .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later on .
and what &apos;s below , is what we call bureaucracy .
but where would the next aed to help this patient help ?
you have to make 62 different decisions to make your car completely .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go like that .
almost as if we were preparing our lives for a long time .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego room .
i was the only one who could talk to the airplanes .
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
think of this as a domain point , as a flying dot .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
this is a fascinating adventure that you go on .
that &apos;s going to influence politics , i think , in the years .
we found that in terms of happiness in the happiness of the living themselves .
they evaporate their judgments . they never do anything .
usually most people start to orient themselves in terms of the problem .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges you have to imagine .
and interestingly , bono is also a prize winner .
if you run , yes , every footprint will destroy the floor .
if we overdo it , we can shy away a little bit .
the most powerful climb workers are the head of massey .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe this is a kind of artificial way to read a book .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to be worse .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
because through marine protected areas , we &apos;re essentially restoring the past .
i want to close with a story that really got me excited .
sometimes i lift the balance . a story to end .
i found that technology could make magic possible and not kill .
so now we have reduced the time scale .
so today , evolution can happen in time by microseconds .
this is a rare glimpse of the same daylight .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
we could reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i &apos;m probably not going to be able to take all of you on this journey .
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty left .
car colors , outside the car -- i have 56 options .
they &apos;re not even coming from the museums .
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
i really like your way , sergey . now .
i became part of the wonder of dying on this day .
it &apos;s called eyeast , and you can see the description .
this is the average size of a greener iceberg .
i mean , what does anyone do with so many outputs ?
and as a general term , we can use the word sexual sexuality .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think we can .
we all have to believe in the last things we can &apos;t see .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , it &apos;s called miguel .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to do first of all .
and then the same thing happens in a good , fair conversation .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
we take pictures of these mini-primal detectors .
economists call this a paragraph improvement .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
this is a whole book , an example of non-visual data .
and of course , we all share the same adaptation .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the fda of inotope .
there are cases where we are , like the inepisotopes .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
innovation , creativity , and development isn &apos;t just coming out of our heads .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
because frankly , every project has his own marshmallow .
ceo &apos;s something about average . but here &apos;s what &apos;s interesting .
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
this is a evidence by the way , by the way , that men are not pigs .
this deputy poke over the older black .
but i don &apos;t know how steemed people will be .
you &apos;re about the block , and you take it as a revelation .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back into the room .
bonobos are together with our next living living relatives .
the first one of these falls is an ambiguity , complexity .
they invest a lot of their time in the construction of the growing structures .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little it will support .
normally , you &apos;re just dancing , and some are coming , others don &apos;t .
now he mentioned the minerals of phytoplankton .
i take the breathing of the audience , or unconscious .
you feel that this is the real truth behind the background .
but the question i want to throw up is : why not ?
and the best part is perhaps what we expect in the field .
this is technology supporting innovation that we have today .
and i thought , this is going to be so difficult , so painful .
wr want to help people who were convicted of innocent .
and that means free access , which means openly and productive .
how did he get to search for this particular type of aid ?
let &apos;s jump quickly to moma , back in new york .
template will be part of the show , which is quite desperately .
we produce androgen and we &apos;re talking about androgens .
and if you can do it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
that &apos;s scandalitarian , and we should be ashamed .
and this is the value of this experience , this kind of simple exercise .
but as they talked to different people around the world about these possibilities .
they have a renewable energy today of five percent of the 10 percent .
and they &apos;ve done this with something called leadhd maps .
but the key is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s going to be true .
so i &apos;ve been busy doing what is natural or intuitive .
and these are just the biohackers , the individual people .
it means that we have a cultural impact beside the scientific literacy .
this struck me when i wanted to share my jeans .
he invited the king of sidewalk to dinner .
but somehow we &apos;re going to do it , we &apos;re going to get away from this problem .
and that &apos;s also what i had in the last half-year .
but instead of waking into panic , he just stopped .
how about tears that we can &apos;t even predict ?
if you look at the people that you have to do with ...
and guess what we found in the attack of the attack ?
imagine that every single one of those people is controlled .
okay , let me just squeeze a little blood for you .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
new investments to create good jobs .
6 speakers : social incidence . 7 : 65 deaths .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with me like this and play .
what that means is that the player saves about three beats .
a long time ago , there was gray whale -- 500 years ago .
in many of you , they &apos;ll say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
the ancient interpretation of a piece of a piece is that comparable .
and from my eye-looking angle , i saw the janitors going up and down .
fireflies in a glass of light , i always felt very exciting .
for example , this picture has about 10 billion points , i think .
so i decided when i was 15 to be a diver .
so here i &apos;m getting a little bit larger . let &apos;s see exactly what &apos;s going on here .
and within a few years , lego moved into every household .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer .
and i want to show you my output for this week .
56 percent of all rape accidents don &apos;t come in front of court .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-esteem .
i asked him how he became such a fish experts .
there was the core research facility oddian shadow .
from that time , an anecdote that you might know about .
no longer needed to whistle a to whistle or to sing .
and six milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon of the phenomenon .
this goes back far back into the cultures of the industrial season .
so , i think it &apos;s a very unfolding hack .
i think , somehow , that &apos;s what shshine is , or something like that .
this has actually taken two thousand really lately to eight forms , these networks .
finally , one solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
so , this looks like a basketball plaque .
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
i couldn &apos;t make it better . i haven &apos;t let me down .
well , in fact , the number of nonviolent crime hasn &apos;t changed very much .
i ate it first in a restaurant in southern spain .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on all our humanity .
it was always inspiring , so refugees .
the death penalty in america defined by irritum .
turned the garbage audio onto the site . went home .
alone , this airport has a surface of 100 squares .
i like things that are special . i like weird things .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
so maybe you should put it in front of the interview a little bit of this . &quot;
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine class .
here &apos;s an excerpt from this angriffing code .
we &apos;ve laid out his bed so that he can see outside .
we degraded a human who has value for our society .
we &apos;re putting a game to get the real world .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : it &apos;s .
the secret is that the key to the key to these skills is skills .
this is actually the real melting of human and machine .
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
that &apos;s really my skin . that &apos;s not a special effect of hollywood .
they produced the highest construction in the least of time .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of tonight for everyone on the planet .
i grew up with a higher science fiction .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building sively , not intensely intensely intensely .
so here was a company trying to make it right .
the component is always becoming more to the friend where you live .
and i &apos;m not so sure if they really stay alive .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little flight .
there was one of my opinions , a very good code .
in fact , nasa has shown that there are a lot of them out there .
they like to increase the paralysis and the satisfaction .
now , i wondered how can i actually get that around ?
it &apos;s an independent area . you &apos;re all controlling mineral .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view .
someone was once broken , and the system was fooled .
photographs like this : a building along a much ridge road .
the biggest fear was that they had before pirated , rape and death .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to get out of all these extensions .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange road road .
but it &apos;s a very good meditating opportunity .
i brought some underwear , and that &apos;s all .
but a lot of people get into a very strange position position .
our gut is a wonderful friendly environment for these bacteria .
now , the two species of self throws two terms from happiness .
well , life itself lives its continuously continuously .
there &apos;s a massive wave of happiness among happiness .
it &apos;s just a bundle calendar . it &apos;s mimics .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
ah , the majority . that &apos;s what i like to see as a doctor .
my inspiration comes from an event , which is 2,500 years behind .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
now , what does that have to do with the placebo effect ?
smallpox . the smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
it &apos;s the renewables , as they &apos;re often called .
this is a fish pocket in the south western corner .
since i ask , how do you get this diagnosis ?
the notes did the function of the letters of the letter .
and then these are lasers of the pre-industrial cultures .
this is called navigating across sound and rhythm .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
and that &apos;s where we &apos;ve been working on a cost-born ambulance .
on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to lhc .
should i answer that email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
this is what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
54 percent of the deaths of death row through drilling .
essentially , concrete construction became the building block of our season .
it would be with a new sentence , never before , before .
how can a judge someone turn into something he &apos;s not ?
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lynchmobile .
so programs that can make use of the husbands .
for example , the fish had been taken on a smooth flight .
opportunities that weren &apos;t allowed to have been touched , have been touched .
so , i made a few years ago to do this very well .
finally , when we were supposed to be able to welcome the fear of welfare .
an eighth , played marke . how is your brand ?
why is it important to start ? what does that mean ?
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free of constraints .
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
well , in this night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
and the crucial indicator of that is the extinction of the languages .
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s not that test .
and this is called androgen-receptacle defects .
we &apos;re developing communal thinking , heart creatures .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a ph.d. .
but at the moment , we have an incredible opportunity .
and soon , i wrote an article about genetic food .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
so i offered a 10,000-dollar prize software for the winner .
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
there was no four valentines at all .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
even if you were to shoot yourself , you would have emissions .
most people know the most people who know this from the software area .
this is actually live in the internet . you can check it out .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nunveiled .
but nothing was invented , that would let me go back to now .
and the best part is that they connect with magnets .
some of my favorites happened in the last five years .
i looked into the rack , and it was a little bit of pink .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular tongue .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
so the dramatic numbers come from the prisoners of prisoners .
i gave some talks to germany in germany about death penalty punishes .
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkeys today . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
this is my side a.m. a very simple thing .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
in the context of what is the idea and feelings about them ?
and when the dangerous ones are , they can actually happen bad things .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
they talk about nature &apos;s power to tell us who we are .
if we don &apos;t actually take a phosphorus and put it in .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the magic thing for me .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours , video is uploaded every minute .
if they could do it for the people , they could also help me .
and just disappeared all these companies , one after the other .
i &apos;m sad that we never know each other as adults .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserve it .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
and so when we think about it , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go to the house .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
specialized skills and processing skills and their combination of success .
the people here have contributed to the development of this wonder .
and somehow we need to bring changes that down to zero .
we &apos;re still finding other features of what their rights are .
this is the time of most perceptions that we have .
this is our youngest taster tester down there on the right .
by the end of march , the lhc will be able to do it again .
and this is the message i took in medical school .
do you know how to call a 30,000 in league baseball ?
i believe that in many places the opposite of poverty is justice .
if somebody lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
and that &apos;s why i believe that the ted community should be horse .
and she &apos;s spreading away , organic , of course .
my friends from honduras asked me to say , thank you ted .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
now , finally , the film has a very big impact on earth .
this is actually only a period of two thousand / 2 / 2 weeks .
these people will be connected to the movie in eternity -- forever .
so all these green areas , these are the richest environments .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; sally . &quot;
so unfortunately , we have a little bit of god that goes as far as virtual .
i got into the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
in the short time , i realized one thing : ted has an identity .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make you very , very tired . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good intuition to actually lead the experiments .
in my opinion , mass , our world has changed fundamentally .
this is all reality today , and the future will be much more possible .
so that allows play to play together , trust and interact with each other .
here &apos;s what you do , the more you kill , the better .
people said , don &apos;t you worry , are you not afraid to succeed ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , but i can live with it .
and what i learned is that error is absolutely unbelievable .
i love this one , &quot; watson is doing human opponents . &quot;
i looked at them and smiled , but she looked very serious .
three months later , i moved around , and the adventure went on .
it &apos;s about creating goods from commodities .
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gray sound and a stuff .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
that &apos;s what we want to do as a possible impulse for the flyces .
and the question was , how could you connect technology to make new technology ?
for example , i don &apos;t want to give you the same rights as a human being .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and that &apos;s very quick .
i played the first sentence from beethoven concert .
man is supposed to be from the monkeys or a common ancestry .

on september 10th anniversary , the machine went to the first time .
we distributed live kids , and you see them playing with it .
and as i listened to her , she made a living sounds .
and i was good , i closed it with claude .
but if i ask you , how do you deal with your wife ?
you collect information about the play in the secular literature .
there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they can all get engaged .
but what if that picture you lined with all your images ?
you say that you never die the names .
but she does something that does not do any other regional technology .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
so i sat down , and you played the tedtalk .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen before .
we should be able to eradicate everything we want .
and i tend to see my shadows as my shadow .
well , studies have been conducted to see if that was true .
and then you can see what enormous amounts of capability is there .
the natural world comes from asia , in the case of japan .
because a good engineer has either built great cars or nuclear power plants .
that was the very first beginning of a musical expression .
you can only have nuclear explosions if you &apos;re not there .

now there &apos;s all this rumblebee before the big unveil .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
they knew that they had to do any kind and bits that they had to attack .
it was like the football world cup won .
in our considerations , we put together in all sorts of inconvenient areas .
and she was much worse than for a b in the memory .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who suffered from both more ? &quot;
we don &apos;t only tell stories when we do to tell ourselves about telling stories .
it &apos;s a deception to something , because somebody is going to perceive it that way .
why ? because we don &apos;t have children &apos;s paralysis , and you know what ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
if i don &apos;t right , the channel is not a man .
you &apos;re basically learning that first , before you just talk a word .
in order to keep pragmatic practice , right with the composer .
we can go directly to these kinds of nutrients and nutrients in agriculture .
more sensitive to the tool use of information , since jean-stories have been .

why am i changing from my audience now that it also actively listening ?
when your work flew -- not your mistakes , right ?
we know something about what determines happiness itself .
but a white ball is not as good as a blue pill .
and all i can say to that is , why do we fight that ?
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are terrified .
and that &apos;s a thought that i think is appropriate .
and we got to a time period of four and a half years into a real family .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fishing on the birds .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;

if you keep your contribution here , whatever he wants to be his furniture .
and neither of the machine leaders , the security system will notice .

beyond the simple play , littlevitating is actually quite powerful .
and this is one of the three main sources of existing online problems today .

this is the result of the faster computers , the faster computers .
bryan , you &apos;ve actually brought a string up to the pig .

okay . everybody &apos;s ready , gary &apos;s supply .
how good do you think you &apos;re going to make decisions about the forests ?
all parties , all the examples of society , supported this .
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone , it &apos;s not too much .
and who &apos;s continuing to see that this is particularly true for men .
because when the water flows , it falls down in the atlantic .

today we can have dozens of companies that have done exactly this .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .

but this picture is really completely interacting with pictures of different places .
the scaffolding from the ladder came out of the rest of the world .
and today we all feel like we &apos;re all feeling ownership of our culture .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet until the next day .
in the meantime , i turned to a talk at tedglobal .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
so how are we going to ask the question of the character ?
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took the last 13 years .
they &apos;re creating an epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
this business , it was almost like a pleasure savings store .
this is , of course , high-tech agriculture , but the charges carry themselves .
you connect it with a particular tone , and then you close it to the entry .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different methods .
but there &apos;s a key difference : the transistor was just for experts .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out with this .
it shows unprecedented what happens when governments attack their own citizens .

tell me about the &quot; why , &quot; how does it take us ?
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you about today .
but only when i got 30 , i really understood what this means .
if we look out , these kinds of changes can be increasingly possible .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change as a single world .
we think we &apos;re not as good as play in reality .

equally large forces with intense curse signs of each other .
because the france facilities could go back to the best phosphorus .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new possibilities .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
this is not political active ; this is bureaucratic .
so i made this thing in a similar way that you make a computer chip .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist .
each paralyzed paralyzed can actually communicate with your eyes or your eyes .
i grew up with a mother who taught me that day for the day .
now , these are three weeks , and these are at the same time .
if we go back there , what should be the 2020 permission ?
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
if you want to see the functions of the car , you can see them here .
these are the questions that we need to do the next 50 years .
so these are the hammer-heads in the piano of my finger .
i &apos;m going to start by showing you a single slide , boring slide .
so it &apos;s more about starting to capture an idea than really a moment .
and also , the mother of the vidian here today , is in the fourth of the fourth or fifth .

this has all digitized , knowledge , and it makes it accessible by the internet .
which is , of course , extremely creates objects , and it &apos;s a computer game .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it comes to a magic blackboard .
so we decided to support tony -- and to support his thing .

in fact , for the living self-assembly , there was a worse time .
and it &apos;s sitting there , and it &apos;s burning there for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
and so i want to show you what another little surprise might be .
so we can now jump up and look at all the ted prize winner .
that &apos;s just to see if you go back and look at the whole thing .
a piece of work that you never look at has no force to do .

and he said , &quot; well , you can &apos;t remember me .
it &apos;s not about shooting genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
there &apos;s going to be a whole lot of contradictions and arguments .
and this is this projection of vision , feedback copying , see .

another thing is , because i &apos;m going to draw something like the paper right here .
we have two creatures , both of the mid-1979 on the same day .
fantasies had always been maps , but these cards were static .
and every single thing is used to use the exact same letters and the same code .

they played a sauce game , and the victory to a episode of adventure .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , that &apos;s the success of the scientific method .
it would have been without the environmental demands , but the power does make it so much more important .
i certainly would never do an alien world with a spaceship , which seemed quite unlikely to me .
we won &apos;t answer it immediately , but this is what &apos;s going to happen , and this is what &apos;s going to happen right now .

so what can three billion growing , healthy , productive , productive members of the human community ?
it &apos;s also important for me to do something that is indiscriminate , but also very time-consuming .

and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and the production of our individual memories .
what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s , or reduce the risk of getting cancer or stroke ?
and then on a weekly day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke in front of me , and maybe i can feel better again .
it got me over and over and over and over again when this week came up to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
they just told them that the student and the students are the students with the note of the note , and they taught them something and they treated them .
well , the place of terrorism , but that was , you know , stepped up and wind and solar power and solar energy , and that &apos;s where i started in the middle of the achute .
depending on how i swallowing , and when i throw around , it &apos;s , of course , a whole other coverage of living as if there &apos;s a living one of them .
and as you can see , this is a very inspiring area , and you had to kind of navigate , from island to food to monkeys .
he was born in the age of two years in jail to hide under her rock , because she couldn &apos;t live without life .
now , when you start to look at the idea that these different cultures can create , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant .
just remember that a massage warrior with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communication than president reagan 25 years ago .
in a world where every single minute video is uploaded , it can only be really unique and unexpected how the videos said .
some time ago , if you wanted to win a formula formula , you would take a budget , and you would put your budget on a good driver and a good car .
today , you can have a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome to a price of $ 20,000 and in the space of about a full week .
i came to the conclusion that i was working in a target that was different than the goal of evolution -- not inevitably contradiction , just different .
and you know what ? when i say that , i write the people up to me and say , &quot; what do you care about ? let people do what you want ?
because , as i said earlier , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it , and it &apos;s not a chance to actually form well .
and even though the answer to &quot; no , &quot; it certainly will be your experience of the football game of your child very different than it would have been .
they have a selective language , and it &apos;s called the linguistic examie , and you have to marry somebody who &apos;s speaking a different language .
unlike the old-fashioned food classes , whose existence was totally unknown to me , there was no such thing as ray scans .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer all the people in this audience , including an inclusive , to offer the most beautiful road in the world .
so , this really got my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
some of them refuse to give up and write claims to the bitter end , while others don &apos;t keep it more and they &apos;re in a case dramatic passion .
of course , the problem is that , as we begin to look at all the commonalities , we need to start asking ourselves to ask why we keep certain bills .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in vaccinology against influenza that has been built in the cells in a taboo plant .
we have a comic book . we have the level of the regional knowledge , knowledge mesh , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
so , if we look at the evolution of our society , right now , we &apos;re moving forward to the third generation of the fourth generation or form .
i know and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to do the job because you &apos;re coming out of a series of hundreds of thousands of programs that have done the job .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock ? &quot;
in the other part , i was dressed in unsafe life , the tragedy of the violence , the abundant abuse of drug abuse and isolation .
when we warmed it up , the light turned on , and we looked at the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece .
the founding fathers proved this idea , and they reused it by a new atomic concept , and this concept was that all people created equally .
there &apos;s a scholarship called the wolf singer , and he says , sometimes he says clouds , there &apos;s no freedom .
that means , from the local village , a global village has become the same principles , of course , the same principles , of course , intuitive , but also the total transparency .
the reason i felt bad about this is because , with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what a good jeans went up .
i sent a couple of facebook news stories , some twitter news stories , and i gave people the possibility to stand up to my right tedtalk .
and maybe we can do it , wider than something natural , and mimic and feel so ubiquitous about their presence , not that much more .
i &apos;m saying that i &apos;m sleeping my wrist , to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeve or comes out , and that &apos;s a lie .
because we &apos;ve done all of this with just 10 to 12 people who have been working together for years , sometimes we &apos;ve done two to three months .
and now you can just , if you want to do anything , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , those courage to lie .
remember , when carl sagan was the voyager-vehicle spacecraft , when it was on saturn , back in the direction of the earth ?
and then my friends , who do little presidential movies , &quot; well , how are we going to do with these big , old hollywood feet ? &quot;
what they returned was an anatomic concept , and they reused it by another , which was radical and beautiful , and it was 200 years for us .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you look in italy , like the people in the bow bow &apos;s boardroom , it &apos;s made out of the car .
a country has already offered its most suitable courthouse in order to provide courthouse as to the disposal of the village .
and i was amazed to resist the resistance , to the resistance of what is most effective in health care in human history .
i spend most of my time with the socially weakness in social settings and places where there &apos;s a lot of hopelessness .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every commercial agency we talked to , which has their customers recommending the fingers of it .
and they took the toy , and they decided that anatomically , they were counting , not the difference , and that was very radical .
and at the end , we &apos;re really standing in front of a choice . do we want to make a monomatic world of monotoney , or in a variety of polymatic world of diversity ?
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal had to move all this quantum mechanical mechanism that we had to send out all the compassion .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , it &apos;s the highest , isn &apos;t it ?
we &apos;ve digitized almost 20 years to digitize , and when we sequenced the human genome , the whole shift from the analog world of digital biology to the world &apos;s digital computer .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be that full of pure , if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning , that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence is about one .
so , to buy new jeans to buy after many years of the trajectory , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
in order to give a sense of what i had to do , of course , i had to do something about this remarkable belief of doubt and voodoo is not a cult of the black magic .
and because nothing is more important than our survival , the first halfway for all of this information is part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i got most feedback , or where i had the greatest success , are those where i interact with things .
now , i don &apos;t want you to use too much time to imagine the kind of stuff , because if you think about all the time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
you have to separate two things : to be a medical fact , to be an medical fact , to be amputated , and to other social opinions about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
the grant of this company was to translate the phase of the phase of the opera processes with sacrifice prints , and to start with digital production .
and you don &apos;t have to -- when the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to take the data on a usb -- how we saw it in stuxy .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable , which has a memorable reminder of the self from a living himself . it has very little influence on this story .
and she works in a medical culture , which recognizes that people fill the system with life , and when it &apos;s like this , people are also making mistakes from time .
and it &apos;s going to enable people to measure their blood pressure , send it to their physician , and share it with others for more than 100 dollars .
so the first case : all the atoms that are made of atoms that are still in the metal , and at the same time , all the atoms are moving at the same time .
when i think of creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibilities .
but the latest evidence of dna evidence is that the etrunks , later the root of the roman empire , the same dna as the old poetry .
how to increase happiness , it can be very , very dependent on how they think and whether they think about remembering the memory of themselves or whether they think about life itself .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think about a column -- the bug it , without the whole complex .
we &apos;re going to turn it on , and we &apos;re about to collect the first data in june or in july , and we &apos;re going to use our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
we want to create the world of creating invention , the inventor , the contributors , because this world , in which we live , in the world , belong to us .
imagine this device . in a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease bursts and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
so i decided to go one day to visit the lists , and i asked the head , &quot; this model works , that people really offer all these possibilities ? &quot;
the head of congress came to the stage and said , &quot; professor romer , i thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
we need to take these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the machine and go to the future , we will be happy to have done that .
so again , i stood back with a little team on unknown , and we turned hfather &apos;s &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
and then we don &apos;t have the capacity , but that &apos;s true , i think , quite well , that &apos;s where people are right there .
i mean , it can make a very strange thing to think about , that a thing is , at the same time , two different places , but they were born with this idea , they were not born .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is what it needs to take us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; -- to a ta-day moment .
but the latent was quite beautiful , and the people in my company told me that we were not able to be able to be able to do that .
i was a seventh 10 , when i went back to one of his classes , and i played the last four balances of toes in a late work .
when your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at everything for you , everybody knew that you had this physical genius test that you had helped you .
on nine people that we &apos;ve come , we &apos;ve got an extent that we &apos;ve made for innocent , which has been released and out of death .
so an organism could learn , for example , to eat a particular kind of fruit , because it was bad and it was sick , the last time it eaten it .
i personally find out that it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to compromise any compromise with the ideas in your head .
it &apos;s about how you encounter people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and create them a satisfying experience .
after all , this older black man came out with a very troubling face in the courts and sat down , almost like the defense bank .
there it is , &quot; this airplane is made out of hundreds of thousands of little bits that are working together to make your flight . &apos; &quot; does that not make you more visible ? &quot;
one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in , &quot; thylacines in my trash . can &apos;t you say if it &apos;s dead .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults wanted to know me , she made me know , she turned into a box box , and was put in my hands .
we &apos;re going to have a process where perhaps 100,000 years of rule , and we can get it to a thousand years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years .
there &apos;s a number of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-uh-uh-uh-oh moments than others , and under the worst of the chocolate bins .
this is what we &apos;re seeing in the first place that we &apos;re going to see before we see it , again , going back into our device at the same time , getting in the machine to say , okay .
his job is to create the conditions which are less than a billionth of the universe at the beginning of the universe -- and that &apos;s up to 600 million times a second .
but they also have a secret to our future , a future where we need to adapt to increasingly challenges , through larger creativity and pressure .
and many discussions that i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion i had in the last three years .
a saint pencil , if you do the full power of water , which is enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s four to four six-legged in a way .
and what happened was something interesting , which was very interesting to me about jacques cousteau &apos;s cousteau , which was the idea of a totally unknown world on our own planet .
and our european connected net net is basically made out of noisy animals by big power plants , wherever the wave is all around europe .
a process that everybody -- like everybody knows , who &apos;s ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everybody -- doesn &apos;t always give it any reasonable .
and every year , we ask the students to create products , products and services that can live within a decade the lives of billion people .
i &apos;ve come to the ted because i believe that many of you have understood that the moral compass of the universe is going to reach out , but that it &apos;s increasing .
and finally , saturday : a unique , unique style , is a great way to tell you about a world without saying a word .
they didn &apos;t count , because he was locked up with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to do .
i think that the molecular biology in general now , generally , general biotech , biotechnology , everything you count in terms of synthetic biology and so on .
how about giving the oppressed , wherever they are , to give a voice to make change and change , for the first time , for the first time ?
i love to find any opportunity to find a different colorful , crazy output , to wear , and to photograph in the last time , to photograph and to blogger .
i &apos;ve told my wife , whenever a human being is in a moral justification , because we should try to replace it by literally replace it , even though it .
and it turns out that if you make it feel that something concrete feels , it &apos;s a very good tool for people to save more .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for bringing the people we love to keep in front of the faithful sales , but they also prepare to prepare for it .
so we take something very complicated , convert it into sound to produce a sequence of pottery , and produce something very complicated in the head of others .
no , it just looks a lot better if we show that we are constantly assumed to eliminate the dangers , the other ones , when they just lay their fire .
now in egypt , in egypt , the emergence of april in april 2011 , the main source of the egyptian police department , and they found a lot of active .
and after about a year of planning , two weeks of work , they did work , they did persuasive parties , and they would draw through tony drawing for the first time in seven years .
so this is what this reactors was a problem , which we fill in our fills , and it &apos;s reduced to the volume of the volume while this process was reduced .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point of view : we have the biology digital and now we &apos;re trying to create the digital code into a new phase of biology by building new biology and building new lives .
but this holds me up at night -- one of the things that makes me wake at night , and we &apos;ve never needed scientific advances like this before , never before .
it was the premier premier in january , and since then -- and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls of this film .
yes , it &apos;s a huge debate in the moment , at the moment , to build coal power , because we don &apos;t do it , or gag , because that &apos;s not going to happen .
a lot of our friends thought that we were beautiful dumb to do that , and that we were coming back and forth all the pictures of the walls would be graffiti .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst error was only in the first five years of passions , which is a lot of my colleagues , but complete nonprofit .
but these apps are like little digital memories , that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of the government , the control and the services .
when i was a graduate student at stanford at stanford university , i went to this very exclusive lifespan ; at least at the time , he was really exclusive .
in a country that has just been elected to a hefty crisis , where congress has been voted for this congress to change between 124 .
it seems like we were right by the other parts of life , but in fact , the biggest part is the fundamental mechanisms of our mechanisms are pretty much the same .
but the logic of the disappointment allows us to do it as if the first sentence were to be wrong when you had to adopt the opposite without any evidence .
it &apos;s always a very fortunate concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;m going to work so long on in the process of experiencing how to experience it .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists in my talk stood up and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing you to hear . &quot;
well , there &apos;s been some bicycles and mines , these things that come out and go , but an amazing brand is a pretty strong thing .
and if you &apos;ve already got the drug that the drum is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the data is a science for itself .
if i tell you that somebody has been living as eight on a scale of 10 ala , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living himself .
now , i dated with a few people in the company , and nobody could give me an extraordinary answer , until i finally got to the quiet biologists .
basically , you get each round up on any six-word incident , and as you try to educate each of those words , and you get them about a dictionary .
let &apos;s go back to my medical world of medicine , where i feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little less after i talked to you about it .
but then another other thing happened , very interesting step at the same time , which things got completely different , and they started communicating these cells and making information happen to be made by cells .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference is what we say climate .
they stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all they see is fluctuated , and these dense poles .
we have now , from our discoveries all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these components of design are the future .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous trust in our future is the fact that today we have more power than individuals to ask us the big challenges of our planet .
so a app which is written in a few days , and then spread out of selected , is a kind of sword to the institution on the institution of the government .
what that means is that if you were to meet somebody , and you &apos;d say , oh , his father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about his size ?
at this point and when you laugh , you realize how important this gap is , and how much time you need to have to experience something which is very good for us to share with us .
how it would feel to live in a world where the german administrates human beings , especially if disproportionately had a lot of juries .
and because the government ultimately puts their power out of us -- reminder to you , &quot; are we the people ? &quot; -- how are we going to think about how this change happens .
are they reliable , stable , stable , safe , safe , safe , sacred , sacred , and how the dalai lama or younger ?
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard , which is the most powerful psychoactive paragraph from the repertoire of the ample .
and very often , i &apos;ve worked with sexual inters , whose gender is breathing -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female types .
we had to do that all of us at the time . when we read a children as a laser , we took the descriptions of the austrian and projected them to the canvas in our heads .
we came up with music . and a few days later , i got an email who stood up to nathaniel education for me .
and since we give ourselves to the media campus , for example , the virtual reality in our v.r.a. lab , we can actually do it all the time .
i spoke to him , you know , you know , you know , and i both know when this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not entirely my guilt , right ?
because it makes a lot of sense like anything else that i &apos;ve heard from when it was about explaining the absolutely crazy amount of creative process .
so it &apos;s as far as well . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the greatest scientific experiment ever done -- 27 kilometers away in diameter .
and i argued that we might be able to create a new form of the cambrian explosion in which there could be a massive new kind of education based on this digital design .
the reason is that it used to be better than anything was worse when everything was worse , it was possible for people to make an unpleasant surprise .
and i negotiated with me that if i was able to double my efforts and never make a mistake that the voice might be surrounded .
so these are just some of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but also the last six days , or the last six years .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew i was going to take several months to plan to find the different places for the puzzles .
but also , because it turns out that by using all this time , we &apos;re actually starting to change the way we are able to change people .
i can have the sounds of anxiety who have had the bach , on the modern wing of modern wing , which can make a baroque that can &apos;t balino .
already out of the german &apos;s english translation , can transform more knowledge , even if you think about it , or even to poetry .
bg : well , we need one of these scalable , viable things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then spend 20 years on it .
if you &apos;re also playing , you &apos;ll see some nuances here , looking up at the top of the eyes and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprises .
you &apos;ve got to imagine that if you do something of the classic soils , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software just an hour .
i &apos;m a german animal . to work on it every day , i have to stand up at the same time and swim down , i &apos;m really pleasant and unpleasant .
so they found , according to heresotopus , the worms and agreed a national strategy , and on a day you would eat the next day .
the other note is whether we use the zero-sum technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest .
the movie , i sold this as &quot; romeo and julia &quot; on a ship , &quot; it became a feasible film , a passionate movie .
so far , in discussion , we &apos;re always trying to do this insult , that the targets are doing , the targets , which has a little net , which has nothing to do with our connected and nothing to us .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , which is , in which we can actually make the electric knowledge of the scale of one at three scale .
that is , the interpret has to translate this ungene from the emergency language in a different language , namely , concrete , non-verbal music language .
and the intuitive usage has not only been a major economic factor , an elementary factor , even if i want to use technological devices to make people usable .
many journalists called me on the question , &quot; what are you going to do , the late that tells us if casters are female or male ? &quot;
now , what i &apos;m hearing all the time is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing that &apos;s wrong .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and to get them to play a kind of game in order to control their health .
and imagine , i even had a five-year-old child with dr. p. and so i tried to stop this practice , natural success without success .
bg : well , the actual exact spending for the research -- say , we should spend the u.s. 10 billion a year more than you do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that lets us explore and interact , and that is unexpected , that we are , that are real nutrients of creativity .
and since there were no video games nor these sentences with computer-generated movies that had to create the whole language in the media landscape , i had to create images in my head .
as you know in the village , who has wounded something with whom and when that &apos;s happening today about this extension of our own self through these mobile devices on global scale .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to be able to take responsibility that i was so handed , and so i would be able to go into my patients with no contacts .
i got a punch line , because i &apos;m not on my way away , but there &apos;s a lot of disabilities that don &apos;t let go on the bike .
and so i see myself as one of the individuals , together with most other experimental quantum physicians who need a good logic to put the complex ideas together .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream , &quot; a kind of solution .
jacques cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating shows that surround us and places and a world of wonder that we could never have imagined before .
and if we succeeded , of course , we can think of it , for nike , for sickness and maurits and all the textile industry .
in each step , we &apos;ve produced these pieces in the translation so that we could sequence them because we tried to create a very robust process of what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
unlike the 20th century conversation , the community of the 20th century is part of our community to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or making it a new thing .
my wife , my kids , and i moved into the garage , and these hacker programmers and conspiracy , and our archival have taken over .
we can go on a step further , and then look at the data , and see that circular disease and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
90 percent of the big fish we love , the tuna , the tuna , the healing bugs , the chlakes , heavy fish , they &apos;re broken together .
over the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , which has tripled the average income of the world &apos;s population .
one of the areas that we see in the same places where we are today , in our culture , in the united states , are struggling with the beginning and the end of life .
now , this is good , besides paul &apos;s walking around and talking about vaccines and says , how valuable they are , and that people should just stop doing it .
the second of all is a consequence of experience and memory : it &apos;s basically happy between his life and his happy life and his life about his life or living with his life .
you go up in these capsules , you sweat this dark , hostile environment , where there &apos;s no hope for rescue , if you don &apos;t make it back .
so from that , you also notice that there &apos;s a change in there , and it &apos;s just from this absence of position , yes , to the idea of reducing a hundred percent renewable .
it was pricked in the cell , and it recognized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and so we just ended up having a cell with a new chromosome .
and these scientists have just been documented the various themes of documents with these ceo , and how much time they make , how much time they make decisions with the topics .
everybody , i think , &quot; titanic , &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have hooked up somewhere around the globe .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and i should do that as well , because that story , as romantic as romantic as it is , is also utter .
my first memories are from this boat -- the stealing of the motors of the motors , the clapping of a wave on the bug , the shut and the range of the horizon .
and if you manipulate the speed of this novel , you &apos;re actually able to crack the pace into the arrotor , and eventually , the centrifuge to exploit .
it &apos;s the living self , the doctor of the physician -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; are you doing it now when i &apos;m wearing it here ? &quot;
now , when we go on and look at age , we say 40 years or younger , we see that even the main thing is to worry about the people .
we should call them what they are , a commercial action in the process , an ecological capital , which makes the ecological capital , which enables these production .
we &apos;re going to see if we can use storage co2 , which is simply brought to productivity , converting co2 into the fuel process to drive this process .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
if people take this seriously , i mean , it seems to be on the head , everything we believe , for example , in tax politics and so on .
it depends on a third sentence , which has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and it &apos;s as if the opposite of the first sentence and the exposure .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were living in the crew -- and design -- where we actually started doing the company -- we were starting to do it slowly .
this one looks like , who has no freedom of speech , can &apos;t be pulled for his actions and claims to responsibility , and therefore he &apos;s so unable to calculate .
since i &apos;m going to have more life expectancy than today , and that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to have my palm oil still much more color , emotions and emotions and emotions today .
it &apos;s also in an artistic aspect of biological materials , and yes , electronics , and combined and combined in a fairly bible way .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat oceans , is as fascinating as we can imagine .
and then the scope of the semantic connection and the scales that come out of it are really enormous , it &apos;s a classic network .
i did a poll recently with over 25,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that make the attack a typical americans a day is 70 .
a couple of weeks later , the firestorm gave a letter to the house in which they care about the taping of their house .
the food that a chef or a chef chef has to be checked , and not only looked at it or receptacle .
you should be talking about these innovation strategy , and you would be smiled by the ridiculous money that will give you the innovative things .
and if you want to go over 20 , three percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the moment , you have to turn that off .
and then we have a v.d burning and burning the wheels , and then we tried to focus on this camera .
and of course , the opportunity to randomized instructions is very small , so they just added numerous numbers , so i don &apos;t think any of the instructions actually do this .

and yet , the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for the global warming global warming , which is remarkable carbon dioxide that you see here , everything .

we prognostic that , in 10 years , the declaration of the civil rights rights rights rights rights rights will be as high as the legacy of the law .
and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s grown up with the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to build systems right .
and so far the isolation goes to the isolation of the species as a distant planet , it becomes isolated , isolation and the changes of the environment that could produce natural evolution in a way .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you have to do a director too , a leader can also be a leader like a ship or something like that .
and after a very short period , it had lost all the characteristics of species , and converted to a completely new species based on the new software that we gave in the cell .

and if you &apos;re familiar with the ancient greek historian historians , you may know this story . the story of how and why games were invented .
but i think , in this framework , and with the intention of making something real , i &apos;m going to just leave the needle there and go from the stage .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try and look at things , whether it works , if it doesn &apos;t do that , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
a lot of arguments . fishing pollution , most of them , they &apos;re most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take a big part .
and because they &apos;re much harder than we do , and because they &apos;re only three to six months of life , they &apos;re talking about weight in their weight , in energy consumption , something is three billion people .
so if you take the system like i &apos;ve been taught , and all the failures have been discharged , then the system is no longer left .
i think that &apos;s the remarkable values of the united states over the last few years , the last few decades , that we are driven by a physical world .
so gender is really complicated ; sexual interfaces are not only standing in the middle of gender gender -- in a sense , you can distribute the whole bandwidth .
and by the way , we migrate and circular , and we have so much that you can &apos;t say you can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for evolution to find a statement .
of course , the stories that i chose were from the science-fiction area : &quot; terminator , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
and in this scenario , imagine that in a case , a chma is wearing a chomosom , which hits the x chromosome of the eggs .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive , to survive and to thrive from the fight of the human mind is determined by conflicting conflicts .

urbanization optimism is the desire to do something immediately , to a lovely star , to do with the belief that we have a profound hope for success .
well , very quickly , another reason that we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we can &apos;t look at the same thing if we think about life and actually live .

there was never before in the history of the technology development , this kind of recursive growth , which is the size of the exponential increase in the exponential number of years .
and secondly , when we have a species of speculation , our environment , that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to it , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re adapting to .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill , which doesn &apos;t work as good as a capsule , which doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .

the fact is , you look at the objective , the first time you had information , as the second time , but i would tell you that it was the second time that you recommended it .
so when i knew i was going to come here to a tedtalk to a tedtalk about the world and sponsoring sponsors , i knew i was going to do something a little different .
i would write it this way : not the most powerful way of doing it , and not the most intelligent type of its , but the one that can adapt to the best changes .
that &apos;s true for lawrence , thinking about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists to think about happiness , because it turns out that we &apos;re just as different from each other .
right now , we &apos;re building mais and we &apos;re losing it between 11 and 30 kilograms of carbon per hectare per hectare , or on squares of square meters .

and what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , like some other guys , which we often meet in our field , is kind of a kind of semi-logarithmic curve .
and if you play with your particles , you will find all kinds of weird things -- how you fly through walls , or you can be at the same time in two different places .

it &apos;s very different from saying , we have a 3.5 foot truck , which has to be under a three-foot bridge , and then you can put it in there .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects are actually just up in real objects that are put together in a small room .
the drivers for disparate objects are not just people , but also the light that it seems to them and the wind that gets them to be over and heat the heat of the room .
but tomorrow , we can do it to the next challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- as we can then change from the digital world to the physical .
while i &apos;m doing this , i &apos;m going to give you some of the lessons i &apos;m going to tell you whether you believe it or not , from these disappointments , nothing new .
it demands that we all do our senses to the task , and that we use our optimal sense of how our emotions and our feelings are , in the challenge that we face .
and we start by taking the garbage , which exists already in these refrigerators or dryer stores in the reactors . this is our burning fuel .
now , with all our digital devices , which give us seven days a day , 24 hours a day , this negative news is not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic .
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , which is why everybody -- maybe only the most electronic health projects we &apos;ve heard about because we &apos;ve stopped listening .
i had to worry about it that it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the story was trying to push us , but we were out of it .
no longer a building that would open to them to let them open , but a building that would still be pauling and holes in the water , you had to jump without fights .
and they do a few tests , and they find out that instead of eradicating eggs and mom , in fact , they have a chromosome .

well , in our city , in the volunteers , a highly qualified professional board supported , you have to be pretty early on the trajectory to be able to mix .
and at the deepest of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom of wisdom , and the wisdom of wisdom that we need to make these decisions ?
the transistor was a little plastic unit that gave us one of the world of the static , stacking up into a world of interactors .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for fellows , it &apos;s hundreds of people all over the country who are standing up and government writing apps every day in their own communities .
so these communities began to develop so that the level of evolution which took place in which evolution was no longer the single cell , but the entire cell community that we call the organism .
first of all , we have the insurance injuries , and in fact , we have actually got a device that can communicate -- a stephen hawking machine .
and part of me asks , what if the content of a personality would be something that would be made in the future of machine reviews -- fmri visible ?
so i propose , if you are fast , then you look for the next 30 seconds , or you know what i &apos;m going to do , the first part of it here .
and funny , it &apos;s in the seventh years at bbc &apos;s home , today , developed sales , and then the license was censored to the japanese .
but to me , as an interactive media , as an amazing thing , is that we &apos;ve encountered our biological memory in our biological memory , the ability to think nonlinear .
the author of the bureaucrat , jonathan , jonathan checks , we still swallowed every year for a thousand hours with the receptor stories .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right to touch their silk , so far out in the ocean , you don &apos;t have the environment . &quot;
and this is a little bit of our vision of a reasonable energy , and i &apos;m also cradle cradle , and i &apos;m also grateful that they &apos;ve said that they use solar energy .
and the wind power , or the solar panels , or whatever it is , is in the rule of a system , which can store a system in small amounts of here .
that means , if we look at that , we can translate models of something else to transmit , for example , the metaphor , i can do that as a result .
so , quite exciting processes , which then in this , you know , gray , is actually not , but right here in this pipe , you just run away .
the exciting phase period came as we took this piece of chemical and put it into a bacterium , and the bacterium started reading the genetic code and viral particles .
the data is transformed into the gray box , damages the centrifuge , and the iranian nuclear source program is delusions .
i have a company that makes design and animations , so twenty-20 figs are a complex part of what we consider in the art world and pay attention .
we have to deal with the unsustainable separation of death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we &apos;re all singing , dancing , dancing and art .

you can see who we were , and how life shapes us , we can now see that the men that might have come to our lives , would have come to us into the quisite .
now , if we can get the systems to combine the systems , which are the roles and the root numbers , then we can actually do a lot of problems with the centrality .
now , after i elected government , i recognized that the wikipediatories , most of the time magazine magazine are the people of the year .
but then it could only be a 3d cloud of points that can be done on them , and they can move through the clue that they can look at , many directions .
and my friends , the big , gigantic hollywood movies , say , the reason why their films are so successful , on the brand &apos;s partners , they have .
we &apos;re starting to put the leadership voice in two sequence of sizable stores , and put it in a row , and add a little bit more to the voice .

when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home , and he brought this mupper with my sister &apos;s napper , and i went to the forest .

it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to explore happiness or whether they want to explore life routine , so we need to have this discussion pretty soon .
if you look at the story of the founding fathers , it &apos;s going to be clear that a lot of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of natural world .
if we don &apos;t do that , if we keep doing this , we &apos;re going to do something that we think about , i don &apos;t think we want to be guild , high-tech .
about 12 years ago , a story published , a terrible story , the autism of the muscles with the massage , the mumps , the vaccines , the vaccines brought in .

a colleague of mine had access to investing in the investment of vanguard , which is the gigantic society of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and therefore , my primates , my primates , let &apos;s take the gift of this gift of evolution and play together as we learn the creativity and rediscover the stainless .
and so the people who decided to participate , rather , to have more options available to them , the more people they rented it , the more they do it , and they chose it .
that means , if you know that now , you &apos;re looking at it , you &apos;re looking at it for a long time , because i don &apos;t take any waters for what &apos;s going to happen .
so it &apos;s just like in hollywood filming , where , during the torture , the waggling of the surveillance of the currency is fed up with genomic video .
we have all these superpowers , happiness , productivity , the ability to unlock social networks , lights , lights , lights and the desire for episode .
so , of course , in the context of my talk , modest , because we don &apos;t move ourselves to physical , virtual worlds , after the model of the holocaust .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve real problems in the world ? &quot; and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve spent my work in the last few years for the future .
we can look at our kids playing football , and we have our mobile phone on the hip , and our blackberry hip , and probably our laptop in our lap .
just the things that disappear , like shoe soles , like snippets , like authorities , like authenticity , have to be so that they &apos;re going to go into biological systems .
yeah . do i get it right ? your software allows that at a time , within the next few years , all the images that are used in the world are used to link together ?
i have the impression that if we make vacation , that &apos;s very often the case , which means we make urbb laughter in the service of the mind itself .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually because he was struck by the fact that the doctors found that he was inside the inner brain .
so , 18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i talked to something , and i had something to do with museums and art , and my chefers , which is also now , gave me light .
two years later , i had a service with the emergency hospital in a communal hospital in a community of torture , and i checked a 25 years old with an old man with rage .
and it &apos;s probably very likely that all i &apos;m going to do is write about the world as a work that &apos;s evaluated after the success of my last book , right ?
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve done on different kinds of research and different kinds of research -- which you can just apply in your business .
so if we think about things like this , then the obvious answer to people would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t sound me , because i &apos;m a big citizen .
and at the end of the day , i packed my stuff , the hospital and went to the parking lot to go home with the car , when i did something that i didn &apos;t do otherwise .
we gave him a little shoe , and we gave it to the same time to vibrate and not vibrating -- which is only in the quantum mechanics .
and the reason for this is that we had a number of medicine , a lot of genes had been selected to be selected , and the population was removed from the population .
so here we have a complete parallel education in which young people are learning what it means to be a good player , like anything you learn in school .
my father , for instance , was chemist , chemist , and i can &apos;t remember the situation in his 40 years , as a chemist , who was asked if he was afraid to be a chemist .
play is a formal transformation , and it can take a lot of forms that some are quiet , antarctica , curious , curious , perhaps to discover the amazing renewables .

some people say you shouldn &apos;t just work on insurance because maybe you do something like a lazy , so you keep going , because you know that your heart will save you .
and we &apos;re just trying to make sure that you can build the capacity , which can build the pattern capacity by decreasing electrochemical stores .
as big as it would have to be , because in fact , you would have to be a battling island on 20 , three , four , four , five , maybe even seven percent , maybe even seventh renewables .
but i bet that it does play with the boarding wave of a very valuable lesson , which is that the big things don &apos;t just leave you over , and they stay in one place .
and we went around the corner , and we had an incredible view of the most incredible view , thousands and thousands and thousands of pink flamino , literally a paintbrush i did so far .
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fisheries that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fish . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .

a project that i did with the hacking network in switzerland itself was that we wanted to make a so-called optical foptical or paintbrush .
but it &apos;s this kind of verae that we have , which we have , and for whom we pay , we pay something that works against us , something else , and then we made ourselves .
and i &apos;m always going to talk to nathaniel , whether it &apos;s in the walt hall , whether it &apos;s in fake disney hall , or in spite of it , because it reminds me of why i became a musician .
the nice thing about the topic is that you can basically take all the things that are going on today , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to get when we want to raise our percentage of renewables .
telecom , computer , obscure , cd , and so on , all of our specialized mechanisms that we &apos;ve built in our community to have this information .
there are a lot of bears who like to be in america , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there are a lot of people who would like to live there .
take two programs , and they produce children through the exchange of their southeast outrage , and the children reproduce the features of the soul of two programs .

we &apos;re putting a game to do anything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , especially in the real world , which is not satisfying in real life , and we get what we need to play out of the game .
there are also some nice opportunities in education like languages , math or logic games , where we give people the possibility of biomimicry and want to see the results immediately .
so i came up with the need of just making a check , and instead i made a check from which i didn &apos;t know the most quiet idea of how i was going to solve it .
it began with a question of the mayor who came to us and said that spain and southern europe had a beautiful tradition of using water as part of architecture .

the sioux india stopped being less on sioux than they were , and they were picking up the americans than they were listening to the americans , and they were doing horse tasks .
she made me realize that telepresence experience , that you can use this robotic avatar , and that &apos;s how your own consciousness can distill into these other forms of existence .
there &apos;s no limiting technology and design that allows us to be very humanly , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , injustice and injustice .

later on , i went to this site with miguel , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems to be so different than any farm i &apos;ve ever been on , &quot; how do you succeed ? &quot;
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic application , which was approaching for three million years the size of the mid-48 countries around 40 percent .
in urban communities everywhere in the country -- from los angeles of philadelphia , baltimore -- 50 to 60 percent of all the young men in prison , in prison , in prison , in prison with insurance or perpetrator .
immediately after this choice , between the 21st and the 24th of february , a righteous pocket of about 30 thirds that were interested in the world that was most interested in creating the business of the city .
so the last example that i &apos;ve been showing you today is a musician sequenced for live , which we &apos;ve developed recently and developed in the cereal sound as the leading voice , bloodshed and stuff .
and we started making pieces , starting with the fifth grade , until seventh seventh letters , and then we put those together to make 23,000-letter pieces to make these things back up to 27,000 .
it empowered us to tell the story of neuromarketing , as we tell the story of this movie , that today you &apos;re using mris to make the lustoms of the brain , both to make advertising and films .
and so i started thinking , and so i think , in the last few months , as i worked on the book , this is going to be coming -- as the dangerous , scary , strong of my success of my success .
both in my profession with robin robin as well as my side profession as a volunteer man , i am witnessed witness by generosity and kindness , but i also see the newest love and the mutual love of individual .
suppose they live in a particular remote area , and they have a beloved love of distorted human heart , and their homegrown is one of these cardiologists , in fact , in the average price of 200 times .
but when i spoke to him , and i asked him why he made these interventions -- it was high risky -- his answer was that in his country , these kids would be very bad , and therefore he had to do it .
and when , of course , something intuitively intuitive , and how i can take as an age , as an age of power and design the things that are designed for them to use a kindness , so they &apos;re intuitive because they &apos;re fun , and then they &apos;re fun to use .
it &apos;s a system where there are two fundamental positions -- those who make mistakes , and those who don &apos;t make any money , those who contain the battles , and the constraints without constraints , which are the bad results and the good ones .
it has three big problems . the cost , especially in high regulation is high , and the question is that you really feel that you can &apos;t go wrong , despite the human work , that the fuel is not used in the air .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid we have a really scores , and they &apos;re holding millions of people out of the blooms .
now , being able to decide not to buy a glass piece of glass is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our prey -- but it turns out that the decision-making problem is that we &apos;re also looking at very rich decisions decisions .
i don &apos;t have to react to these things , because in the same way , it &apos;s going to be a crazy , colorful , colorful , anxiety of outskirts , just waiting for me if i love a little bit in the heart , and it &apos;s going on .
so that &apos;s one effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision we make less peace with the outcome than if we had the ability to choose between ourselves .
here &apos;s a photograph that i took on the north end of the baffislands , when i went to the infoact of founding , and this man , and this man , aolya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of reminder of the self , and you can think of the self as a reminder itself , which is the living self-esteem of life itself .
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people go up , and i listen to all these things because i don &apos;t want to do them with it , or frankly , they disappear .
in the rich world , in the top quest , we may probably be able to exploit and use less , but on average , this number is going to increase every year , and so overwhelmingly double than doubled the number of services that we have in the service per person .
i met these guys from grass , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to propose a light on any type of bee surface , and then draw with a laser pointer on the surface of the negative .
so what that means is , if we look back at what happens in evolution , and how we think about the place of humans in evolution , and particularly how we look at the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a set of possibilities .
so there &apos;s a big challenges here . there are challenges in surveillance . if we say , for example , the energy source of the country is outside the country , it &apos;s not just the technology you need to deal with the risk of where the energy comes from .
but , as we think , the only way we think about biology is that we have a huge impact on food costs , or we have access to food production , if we look at co2 , and therefore we go to these cells .
i started working on how scientific literature works , how this centrifuge is built in natteries , and found that they &apos;re structured in so-called kaskakaskage , and every crashes at 164 centrifuge .
now the intriguing thing is that the prayer koline , the ones that have happened in the lion are mao-inhibite from the very nature of the kind who are necessary to question the trypines . so they ask themselves .
this is a problem , because the frozen frozen reason for the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s a huge amount of carbon that you have , which is when you put up to the micromethane .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of the attack was actually , it was actually slow and uncurable -- obviously in trying to despair the engineering engineers , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get behind that quickly .
so , maybe light bulbs of this technological change , because the more it has always been a different truth , which is that every human society has something very special , very powerful and very powerful that the ability to adapt to human ability , to adapt our understanding .
my good friend ray short has shown us that every tool that &apos;s going to be the information technology , on the curve of mooring law , makes it great , and the price of price performance is all 12 to 12 months .
the first project that we did as an international group , as we became aware of our self , o.k , there are now as real scenes , and we are online , and we know the people who are there and so on .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you never walk away , and never be as moved as long as children as you or you could never have a independent life of independent life , and since then they just swallow me up . &quot;
what if we could turn that situation , and we could put the internet on the head , so that instead of going from one to another , we can start to go from many things to many things to things , and to detect the patterns that were otherwise bored ?
that means we &apos;re feeling as guilty of the earth , that we say , there &apos;s no biodiversity , no bioluminescent , no progression , no pro-gression , and as they all allow us to go back to our own excreations .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i put something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in individual organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information that &apos;s led to the two cells in both real cells .
it was worth it for me to take all of this year into the clean space , because check it , check the massage difference between a single atom and this piece of metal is just like the difference between the metal and the metal .
and i did it until six-legged , and then we got together with friends , and then i became the co-founder of the company , and then i got together with the donor qon who became one of the largest cell manufacturers in the world .
at the time , it was a monkey ront , where it was awhile , and other people said , you &apos;ve actually been terribly insane to read the people who want to talk about it , and then , of course , that &apos;s totally fine .
if a maker in spain has done something unpossible , something magical : allah , ol√© , ol√© , ol√© , allah , allah , great , great , bracelebratory , it &apos;s a flip view of god .
so what &apos;s happening in &quot; the forests , &quot; which is that everything from above to the bottom , from the very beginning , to the very beginning , is completely disgusted -- by the teloper , you &apos;ll see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand .
and the message is , well , we need to have these rotating maths , if we kind of forbid our goals , 20 percent , 20 percent , twenty-three percent , 30 percent , 30 percent , and so on , if we want to reach it .
then you &apos;ve got over a three-month period of time with a &quot; rich note , &quot; which is very good . &quot; it was told to them that they were very smart , and after three months they actually wrote it .
and what i &apos;ve done is , i &apos;ve taken this code -- is the code of normal letter , which we use to symbolize -- and i &apos;ve written my card on dna , and i &apos;ve written it on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve written it 10 times .
and i &apos;m asking myself today , how much of my vision of me as a strong and powerful girl has shaped my view , and i was so able to think of myself as a powerful , powerful and lethal human .
and that &apos;s where you &apos;re going to call them from my all-physician doctor , so that he can see where my weight is , where it &apos;s not just in the moment that i &apos;m supporting cardiology or something , but it also needs a look at the past .
but in fact , it was an excitement on the early &apos; 80s when i started with the elementary school , and it started building my own image outside of my family and forms , and also , in terms of other children around the world , around me .
it &apos;s a picture of the first radiation particles that returned the entire walk back to the lhc , which then returned with a part of the lholocaust , to make a rain come out of the detector .
he brought 400,000 people to this , because he insisted that red beekeepers and lemon has much more effective than antiretroviral drugs , we know that they can be lost on aids .
and finally , i think that even though it &apos;s so dramatic , it &apos;s so inspiring and inspiring and so inspiring , we &apos;re not going to be measured by the technology of our technology , not the things that we develop , we don &apos;t understand the intellect of our mind and our mind .
what i do instead , and what the designer &apos;s doing is , we think , in a sense , abstract way , give this machine , and the machine makes something that makes our skills far better , and better than we could possibly do it .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops in the world , with students , and architects , even with toctowns , and companies , there &apos;s something about this job , which is something that deep insights into nature , and i want to share with you some of them .
and there you can see that we have our seven senses , most of the minds that we &apos;ve just got five , now we &apos;ve already recognized it already seven , because there &apos;s certainly going to be in the future , the next apartment , and as an extension of our own self .
what you have to do there is just seems to be simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to take all the co2 that comes out of the burn , you get under pressure , you get under pressure , and then you hope it &apos;s going to be there .
and like a miracle , he took his violin and started to play some gears of inconsistent concerts , and then asked me to play them , yemena son , kowski , sius , silius .
i committed to the place , and to his brother and father -- with the words , &quot; well , my proposal is this : tony &apos;s going to be talking about , we &apos;ll find him a machine , and we &apos;ll find a way to get his art back .
now , i have to say , if i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex , sex / sex , death for sex -- it seemed quite reasonable at the time , but at every year , it has come to my doubt .
i &apos;m a historic historic student , and in this case , i study how people went with anatomy -- namely human body , animal , animal bodies -- as they went from fluid , with body , concepts ; how they thought about bodies .
because it doesn &apos;t tell me whether it &apos;s the minister of health , which says , &quot; oh , i &apos;m going to take the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; or any creator of cancer that wants to treat his patients with caffle .
so if i &apos;m going to do this now the profiles of the project , then i &apos;m going to collect some of the stuff that &apos;s going to sample , and then i &apos;m going to turn this technique , and then you can say , okay , this hair belong to this person .
he contains the dog and improvised an irrigation , which made the skeleton of the dog and improvised a soundtrack , relaxed to another dog and smash across the grass with the knife on the knife .
the reason why kids are fed with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s pitch or sesmatic twins , it &apos;s sexual inter-sexual interference -- many of them often adapted to the norm , not because this is for their physical health .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like follow-up . centuries before centuries , in the northwest norway , people have been apparatus with sacred fees with sacred dances and music used to maintain stones -- to the murder .
so i also wrote a paper , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought , &quot; well , you know , &quot; root food , &quot; why do you believe that molecules were shooting to a random kind of opaque at the center of nature ?
and then the next , which is now working with this neat model of neural model , or mental model like the software model , they &apos;ve been working on , which is , you have a idea of what the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop , to make the computer usable .
the spirits can be damaged under the big water , answers to the rhythm of the dance , to promote the soul of the living overwhelming , so that the accent is going to end up with a brief moment of god .
it was on a piano currency search for music training in my beloved teacher , professor jellyfish , a famous beethoven convention , contested , and the long professor of music professor in college .
but that &apos;s the way my prototype , which has been quite taken out of it , so on a contrast , the electronics , was closed , and it was the pressure , but it was very high .
we took a ps3d camera , we made them apart , put them on a led-off light , and now we have a device available -- you can build it yourself , we can put the code into the software that you can download free .
we &apos;re looking into this web , see the fifth hertz hertz , and if it &apos;s going to be a four-legacy composition , we &apos;re going to catch some valves , then we &apos;re going to get a little bit over again .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars into technology and design to take a year off and work in an environment that kind of work pretty much what they hate , we let them work in the government .
in this simple thing , we did this simple thing , there was a increase in participation by 20 percent , and there was a number of people who were willing to save the number of people who were willing to save four percent by four percent , and they were willing to pay attention to the savings .
there &apos;s evidence that , in fact , the neanderthals around 60,000 years ago , people have contributed to body injuries with body injuries , and perhaps the life of life in the survival of these people , was valuable for people .
now we have &quot; three-wheeled laws &quot; -- the laws that bring people to behind bars , for a bike lanes , for the canopy , for the lobbian feet , rather than adding them to the sacrifices .
and the idea is , again , imagine that we remove the people with people to do something and the environment -- almost as we call it , we call it skyscrapers , how to create an untapped , but with a cloud .
and yeah , so , you see , it &apos;s relatively heterogeneous , so there are people who do it by themselves , by the home , up to big organizations , who do it more times more in the institutional form .
and for me , the question is , what are we going to do , because our advances in the field of nuclear power , are we going to make a point where we need to admit that democracy could be based on anatomy , could it be done ?
i &apos;ve graduated , and i hope that video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the bachelk of michael burk , kathrust , kathrust , jorcis and janito and janito .
and it &apos;s getting better , the things that you have , and i give you a thousand dollars -- gps , video , video and libraries , and music , and technology , technology to diagnostic -- are literally becoming cheaper and cheaper in your cell phone .
heinrich , because you assume that he &apos;s male -- even though i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the xy there -- you &apos;re going to take a male , he &apos;s a male , he &apos;s now able to do what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry .
finally , a consequence of buying a bad seat if there &apos;s only one way to buy it , that if you &apos;re unsatisfied , and you wonder , why is the answer , is responsible . the world is responsible . what can you do ?
&quot; when we were fighting in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted to do all sorts of things , but what we needed to do was to be a hope , a mental orientation that would sometimes be more hopeless in places , places and being comprehensive . &quot;
here you have this censor between the unconscious and the conscious , which is , immediately , without you can do something about it , and the things you know is that you look very different , so that you can make a lot better for you and others .
because i think that the interactive media in us can resemble cognitive models , cognitive models , so the paradigm , the thinking in our biological memory is very long , very long time ago , and we can just restore the interactive media .
there are the old tyrannical civilization , the caribbean coastal plain of colombia , and in the conquest of this conquest to a volcanic , which is beyond the badly coastal plain .
and before the background , i got myself in the field of design interface , so the next generation of man in the computer in which the computer is working with the human computer in order to engage with how our tools , or how the computer changes from the computer to the computer to the digital assistant .
and i know that some of you are saying , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; the world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we &apos;re all going to speak a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , this new yoruba . let &apos;s be plain .
so , she &apos;s running the house , and she &apos;s looking for the paper , and she &apos;s going through it , and she &apos;s going through a pen , and she &apos;s just going through it , and she said -- she said , it &apos;s like having to reach your hand , and she &apos;s going to get it .
i would be taking this post seriously , i would be born into a world that somebody like me as a person would perceive their lives in a way that can be lost in a way , but today i &apos;m going to go through the chances of opportunity and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and just to discover , and just go through , immediately , characterized by the personality and the access to information , the business of what &apos;s going on -- the last big problem is certainly the biggest problem .
we have this living plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people that i wanted to do , and i didn &apos;t do it , all the fences that i wanted to , all the experiences that i wanted to do , and i never did .
if we change the plastics , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water stores , then you can go back to cellulose , you can go back to a baby in israel , or in tunisia trees .
and it turns out that , under a 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 60,000 , but it &apos;s a huge representative sample , under a 600,000 dollars a year .
i think it may be a little bit more likely to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome penalty , but we need to be open for it to be open , to use it on the verb to use a fight for example , and maybe even dance with it .
congo is a paradox -- a country &apos;s extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness -- the darkness of a massive , violent comprehension that has been deployed for decades , and has challenged so many of the world &apos;s first world war .
so this whole discussion of how is going to move at the moment -- and moving , energy , how to go , like the island we have , for instance , for example , five to three percent of food suppliers , so we &apos;re going to the wind and the sun &apos;s rules .
so we started with a couple of volunteers who were starting to look at something more than a year ago , and we were able to tag the things that they were doing -- different kinds of things like you can see -- things that you would throw away .
tan le , anonymously , anonymous editors of a footage , was now ray tan , refugee and social activist , who was invited to be invited to places where she had never heard of , and in her field , she could have never imagined her .
they knew that every year , about 75,000 hondurans left their land to go out into the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that people stay in their country and the same honduras can do in honduras .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italians , and every boy grows in italy with this picture in his room . but the reason why i &apos;m showing you this is in the formula in the last few decades .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermal sources , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that had seen even things that no one had ever seen before , and for the science that we saw when we saw them , no words had yet .
we believe that polobe milek -- we believe that polek is not persuasive , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for example of the world in the world , and our website gets 35 million a month .
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should share rights in terms of human beings because i have to admit that i know that i know a number of things that probably deserve more socially than some people i know .
and this is what we need to look at millions of faces of holes in the world , if we take the barriers of the nearest century , the face of the nearest , the face of all the jokes on the edge of a episode .
what children do is do differently , is they start building marshmallow and prototypes , successful prototypes , always with marshmallow on the top of the top , so that they have a vast opportunity to repair the possibility of repair .
and then there are things that are already in the afternoon that are completely aware of what most people don &apos;t know , for instance , for example , the washing enzymes that allow us to wash up with four degrees , which are also genetically engineered enzymes .
and then you go to the consumer electronics store to put together a stereo -- speaker , cd , cd , juggling , the radio , the radio , and stronger , and in this electronics , there &apos;s so many stereos .
and i find that they were so denounced and strong , and so radically radical in what they did when i was doing all the years doing this , and seeing the malignant thing about 76 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that is absolutely true .
what we &apos;ve learned from cultural studies is that women , on average , on average , don &apos;t -- but on average , on average , more complex social relationships and worry about people who are within the group are very strong attention .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon that i talked to a few years ago , who had a few acues of identical twins to divide them together to make a name .
now , in order to address these theories , we call ourselves reminded that it &apos;s definitely hugely amongst theaters , it &apos;s got to be a high-end goal , and it &apos;s probably very likely to be in iran because most people are infected .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you take the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse of tissue engineering about whether you should have it to be available , if you want to have things that are getting faster , or that innovation takes longer than we do .
this was a huge effort at that time , because , of course , you started manipulating the living language in a form of form , which is called &quot; fluid , &quot; which is alive , and i &apos;m going to do it , and i &apos;m sort of manipulating it , and i &apos;m also doing it .
so as the golden cat corporation , the 10-foot sales was sold out to the worst catchief , they found that the winner was 87 percent increase -- a result of the increase in price of numbers and reducing the cost of cost .
so the tedtalk in a very simple form that an charter city is a place where it &apos;s uninhabited , a green agreement , which provides the laws there , and offers people to choose to this rules or not .
we followed the genetically of eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people to do something about it , they said that one of the people had gotten so old because of his age , and we still killed him with the speer .
but if we look at these metabolic map , which is very simple , comparable in our trust , and you trust me , this is simple , but if we look at all of these genes that we can eliminate after the other , it &apos;s very unlikely to make a living cell .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose this wish , which is , the biomimicity-to-day carbon replacement . i wish this thing .
this is what it looks like when he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really seeking is somebody who &apos;s released , when he &apos;s in front of him , because he doesn &apos;t know it &apos;s very good in the line when he &apos;s covered by a snow .
at this point , the patients come to the game , they can &apos;t just take control of the control , they can be on their own ship , but they can also help us solve the challenges that we care about , and the cost of public health care , and so on .
and then there &apos;s a memory of self , and the memory itself is that counting and receiving the story of our lives , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor &apos;s talking about , the question is , &quot; how do you feel in the last time ? &quot;
now , in the world of savings , i think one of the best examples of the best examples that have come to the market about how the best choice is : something that &apos;s been designed to david lason &apos;s very strong about david , and it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
about one hour after she arrived at home , after i finished her home , collapsed her , and she called the family 911 , and the rescue assistance brought her back to the emergency room with a 50 blood pressure , which is a dangerous state .
but i remember the lights in front of the oil platform before the malayan coast , and at the young man who died , and the end of the journey was much too much for him , and the flavor of the first app that gave me one of the guys on the platform .
now , what this thing does is that it catches the flow of sensors from sensors -- so for example , the sensors of sensors and vibration -- and it provides legitimacy to the code , while with the folding data , running data .
how can these people find out of a flora of 80,000 species of street advisers not finding these two morphologically related plants , which , if they combined , in a way , can create a kind of organic version of biodiversity , so that it &apos;s bigger than the sum of its parts ?
and there was a time in which there was only one jeans , and they bought them , and they were bad , they were incredibly compelling , and if they had long enough to carry them , and they would have enough , and they would have started to feel ok . &quot;
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why not perceive , that there &apos;s only three fingers at the bottom : because the kind of mind , and the way it works , it doesn &apos;t count , it &apos;s one , two , three , but it &apos;s as a group .
and these sounds and these rhythms have the geology , which has shown the topography of a region , and of course , that it has allowed you to put these fragmenting songs , and put them together , and put them back to the right , and then the way back to the place was able to go back .
i also think there are theories that begin to understand how everything started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplified story of which is that this little oil spills tied around , which are different kinds of receptors for chemicals .
how often we chose a political leader -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we leather back and we expect the government to reflect our values and our needs and our needs and our needs , and then haven &apos;t changed much ?
now this could happen within the lifespan of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years , because this information had to be learned from the individuals who died of these fruits , because of these things , because these information processing structures were not yet available .
for instance , there &apos;s an example of the anecdote that the report of a capitol soundtrack , which is being seen in this area of big fish , cannot be used , or fishing usually won &apos;t be used by scientists , because it &apos;s not scientific . &quot;
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people will cause general , but the ethical nod , the destruction of the lifestyle , is not only convicted , but generally , and my portion of a developmental strategy .
what would be if you could change the sperm and the cells , or the frozen fruit flies , to give your kids a better chance for a better chance to give life -- the eggs , the sacrifices , the hilarious risk of taking care of cancer ?
on the bottom of the ocean , there are bacteria that are thermophil , and that &apos;s what the hot button would be if fish were there , it would be acted to confirm fish , yet they would have managed to make a habitable environment for themselves .
well , the great genetics in the 20th century , t.g. g.e. hannes , who was also a communist in the russian dox church , wrote a paper once , wrote a title , &quot; nothing in the power of biology , except for the evolution of evolution . &quot;
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made it that life itself is a bad patient , and you have a reminder that the memory of yourself is much better , because now you &apos;ve given a patient a better story about your experience .
so not only do you have a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals , not only a farm that measures your success to your health , but a farm that is literally an underwater facility plant , and not just for those fish , but for you and for me .
that you don &apos;t just think of the word for the word &quot; text &quot; in a different language , but you also have to understand the deep sense of the words and the worthy act , so that there &apos;s a sentient translation of knowing that everybody has to do with strangeness .
and if i go back and look at it again , and look at everything , i can rearrange my way to maybe searching for my past . here , i &apos;ve been looking for the netistic &apos; i &apos;ve been looking for it here , after tummy &apos;s labs , or live here .
now , what you could do with patient , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s actually , you could go into the mirror patient of a patient by just leaving the thylacines without it very too much .
you &apos;re doing it to the will for the will , for the challenge of the will -- and the ocean is the challenging environment , the environment , and you &apos;ve been able to discover it , because of the odd connection , and because of the strange connection , when a group of people are forming a little team .
i took them and i gave them some sheet of access to the world at the bottom of this : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in extreme situations , and i took them to the sources of sources with them , so they could take samples and so on and so forth .

now , i might be a little extreme , you know , how little i put on the toes of memories , but even if you make more of it , why do we give a question so much weight in the mind of how much weight we spend ?

so , where the founding fathers were highly assumed to how individuals could be protected to the state , it &apos;s possible that if we could bring more mothers into this concept , we would raise a better concept of not just how do you care for each other , but how we care for each other .

and the reason for that is , if i would draw it on a normal curve , where we say , here &apos;s the years , so the line of a line , and this is a sort of bic technology that i want to do with a graph that &apos;s going to be able to have .

but we don &apos;t even know when we hear someone like that , because we &apos;ve heard this kind of statement for a long time , we &apos;ve kind of like this , we &apos;ve got the assurance and collective creativity , and of course creativity kind of collapsed -- and that art is always the end of the art -- the elsewhere .
and what we did was , in fact , use a new kind of network of network that was used all over the world -- this is a mobile phone web -- and anonymous and anonyaggregate information from that network , which are collected from the neocortex to understand how the city works .

in our wish to protect the people who care about us in the heart , and the calendar , harsh truth about their medical prosthetics , or even a projection for the quality of life that you have to expect , we don &apos;t have to adapt to the foundations that somebody &apos;s actually disabled .
i told you about four techniques , which is the problem of decision-making surveys -- they get rid of the liquid alternatives ; they make concrete -- they make it real ; they can do better -- we can deal with more categories ; less complexity .
because we have this self-deception , this sense of being great , partly because of the highest creature , not of such a rebellious , of something as impairable as a organism , which gives you a sense of comparable stone , which is something that is unsustainable for us .
and that &apos;s when you &apos;re all talking about politics , and the snakes of work and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about , government , in the words of tim , &apos; tim geo &apos; tim , &apos; &quot; what we can do is not do that alone . &quot;
now , this may seem a little bit repulsive , so i repeat it , so i can make it happen to that , if we can solve problems like hunger , climate change , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think , we need to try to play , at least 21 hours a week to play the end of the decade .

but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never make any reasonable work , whether it would work , since it &apos;s been supercomputer , you can simulate it , and you can see it -- yeah , it &apos;s the right kind of material that it looks like it worked .
but the process , and the heavy glue that surrounded him was hovering when he took the genius out of it , where he didn &apos;t let him go back to where he was , and he kind of resigned , and he recognized that he didn &apos;t have to be a squarted thing , had to be bright .
this curious event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called biography , pray , pray -- which , unlike all of my previous books in the world , and a great mega-scale event .

and the problem is that it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can be a simple problem , but it can be a simple thing , like a simple bible problem , a problem , and how can you make it better or how much better you can do it .
feet tall on the crown of plant eats , harmful curves on monoids , the chemicals , the chickens , the chickens , and all the time asked the agricultural industry , &quot; if we feed people more cheaper , how can it be ? &quot;
not through the latest stresses -- and tractors , but by fertility land , not by pumps , but by water , by fresh water , not by chairs , by chairs , not by forests , but by forests , not by fishing and by fishing and fishing , but by using fish in the ocean .

they &apos;re putting out the amount of carbon footprint that goes up to temperature , and that temperature has some very negative effects . and maybe the weather , and perhaps the indirect , that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to the changes , and so that all of the systems are going to collapse .

and where you can see how far we &apos;ve gone from , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , that we can actually see on earth , that you can see that , for example , this program has a program , until 20 times you want to be here , you want to be maneul , yes ?

now , with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what &apos;s the old thinking about the old button , isn &apos;t it , that in the laser aggression , and no more meat or cattle , which is , because i just want to do it , and that doesn &apos;t want to do it .
now , not exactly what i hoped i was hoping , but i went up -- the treadmills , along the way , the &quot; real firemen , &quot; the tubes that were finished at that point were pretty much finished in the bedroom to get a few shoes out of the shoes .

&quot; cloud-like , &quot; a thing that my friends in autodesk called &quot; onics &quot; -- sensors , sensors and networks , robots , 3d printer , which allow our personal planet to democratize our planet , synthetic biology , vaccinations , and digital food , and digital medicine , nano-artificial materials and artificial intelligence .
you can see this amazing demonstrations : voodoo actress in a transaction state , the light bulb without advocating , an amazing actress of the mind &apos;s ability to affect the mind that it &apos;s going to prevent an extreme state in its extremes .

in this picture , i have a bus as a brush of desperation in all of the directions , because if you look at the tree of the tree of life , all of the existing positions on the two-by-step concepts in the evolutionary concepts , they have survived , and it &apos;s been able to demonstrate the environment .
and the premise of this premise with this premise , for example , has been tried to bring in the hugger of england in england , a minimum put together , and then a steam suitcase , a bloodshed , and a hot cap , and so that it turns out that bacteria , and then bacteria stepped out that bacteria works .

i read this list to a friend , and i had to laugh at the first time , and it was smiling , but i just came up until i was going to go to the court , &quot; and i couldn &apos;t talk , &quot; and i had to stop reading , and i had to be able to get through this kind of flood-up currency and the most powerful shock .
a group of homara , which i &apos;ve learned a long time ago , which is a college student , which is a group that wants to communicate more of what she wanted to learn in the uni , and the way in which is to explain so small actions , and to people who are trying to explain what was called ngo .
in my supermarket , there &apos;s 175 dressings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t buy the 10 different extra oil , and if you don &apos;t buy 12 peace , you could buy a huge amount of salt with a large number of dessert , where you don &apos;t have the case that the 175 store is right for you right now .
and that was really , really , really , really , really bitter , and then you go into the phase of &apos; phase , just as a dive into a picture of where i was asking myself for 10 years , a thousand years , the mark was still lovely , lovely , and of course , whether this should be so great .
what i &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , which is a new technology that we have as a microsoft surveillance in a year ago , and that &apos;s a segment of the ragadon , and it &apos;s either a local environment , or you can take away from a huge amount of visual data from visual data .
so the first thing , if you &apos;re a child , as a baby , is that you take care of what you &apos;ve got , what are you doing ? and if you &apos;ve ever allowed your parents to play more or less in your pottering , and you &apos;re going to play more , the curiosity , and the curiosity , the curiously , the curiously , of course .

bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we &apos;ve just got a few million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s working , you &apos;re only in the 1000s .
and this really works , this is going to be done in the academic course , and we thought , well , okay , this is what we &apos;re going to have , maybe we &apos;re going to have a webcam that &apos;s going to do that , the noise , the lens , and then you have a microscope , which is a microscope , which is about a four-and-a-half times .
so if i show you 600 magazines , and you put them in 10 categories , or i show them 400 different scales , and you put them in 20 categories , you believe that i gave them more choices and more choices than i gave them , and i gave them 400 to 400 , if i gave them the 600 of the time to give them .

it would be great if we could put this pattern against the other kind of mind , or the strength of the strength , to actually make it a little bit more dangerous , if we could use the force to release the force of kids , and put them in a very special way , and bring them into the society .
you know , when michelangelo &apos;s mozart is , does it mean he actually took the hammer , and he threw it on the mud -- in fact , you can still see a little injury -- and he said , &quot; oh , perchli paron ? why don &apos;t you leave ? &quot;
but if you print it today in 2011 , in the year 2011 , a new color printer by the leading executives and printing a page , then you have a brick , and you have a side of every single yellow page on every page , in a pattern that &apos;s clearly able to print on your sugar and print it .

and if you &apos;re going to choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species , and you have to think about how you &apos;re going to make this conflict , and that &apos;s not really obvious , because if you think about it at a time , and if you think about it , and if you think about it in the answer , you might have to think about a different answer .

the computer visions have made these pictures together to put them into the real room where all the images of the grasslands in the grassi ponin the canadian rockead rockets , and you see elements of stabilia , or oranges , and all these things are turned into each other .
and if you look at the software that we just saw , look at it , then you &apos;ll also understand why nine-nine-nine-percent of our software or not intuitive at usb , which is a lot of the ipad or into many regions , even though it &apos;s more intuitive , as well as a classic software .
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but in reality , one of the responsibility is a responsibility for the responsibility of somebody &apos;s decisions for somebody who knows -- namely , the doctor knows nothing of somebody -- and probably not sick , and therefore , is one of the best decision making -- is to make the patient decision .
and this idea was that i was talking about when i was in the middle of the presence of congestion , pray , pray , and i fell into one of these grubs that we all fall into , if we work on it , and we don &apos;t work on it , and you think it was going to be a lovely thing that was going to be the most dramatic book that ever written .
we also have one of those same diaggregate in the same size of the same size , as it says there , in the hall , in fact , to be the full dynamic behavior of this grid , which is in this network , which is now in the back here , this is the big batteries that are all over here , which we can do with the web .

now , if i want to give you one thing about this thing today , it &apos;s that the authenticity of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of their parts , and instead of thinking about information , i &apos;d like to think about how we can use information about how we can use that pattern , and so we can recognize the trends that would not be looked at .

i was afraid of not that , but because of that , i was afraid that i could lose it , that he could deceive into one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship to the spirits of mind , if i started to destroying tonight and skill and skill and other forms of passenger pigeon .
so , in fact , the fact that you remember that in the 20th century , 300 years , it &apos;s not for its wars or technological innovation , but it &apos;s more than a gardena , in which we were against , and the massive destruction of the earth and biodiversity on earth either of the earth or passively , so the problem is not acceptable .
i had written this piece &quot; avatar , &quot; which was the measured in visual effects and computer chiefs , which should be shocked into new heights , with realistic human expression , which were the medicines made , and the characters should be all the main cds . and the main cg should be the world .
i probably am hearing , probably the two nice girls are still there , because i &apos;m probably going to hear the generation that &apos;s been healthy for this bad image , because i &apos;ve been searching for 10 nine-year-olds -- and i &apos;ve just started studying , you know , i think , high-tech educators , today , i think it &apos;s going to be high school , you know , i don &apos;t think .
now , if i &apos;d like to start with a example of someone who had a question , who had a root answer to one of my readers , who told a story . &#91; unclear &#93; -- he said that he had heard an fony , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and at the end of the shot , there was a terrible sound of the sound of the sound .
do you know ? i think you &apos;re going to allow a mere person to allow you to think he thinks , or he thinks it &apos;s like the stamp , and the source of it and the divine source of all , creative , unknown , unknown , mysterious , is a little bit too small to ask for some of the human footage .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and at the same time , the co2 level also says , &quot; okay , don &apos;t care , that it doesn &apos;t make carbon dioxide , i wish that it was going to accept it , but i &apos;m probably going to accept it , but it &apos;s probably because it &apos;s cheaper than the forecast . &quot;
it &apos;s actually this kind of making decisions , because if you have a patient who &apos;s going to say , we &apos;ve got two reflections in two different surgeons , and he decides which , then the one who &apos;s chosen to choose , which is the one who has fewer remember , and this is the surgeon , and the surgeon will be selected .
now , you know all the dogs that are healthy , if you give a secret of the best friend of the best prize , even though that &apos;s on a boardroom , and you get a best friend , and the best friend is going to confront a discussion , and yet , if you do it at the end of a certain level , and you &apos;re going to get a little bit wrong , and you &apos;re never going to make a mistake again .
you know , one of the great smartings of traveling , and one of the pleasures in the ethicist research is with people who remember the lives of the old days that can remember the old days , and they still feel their way through the rain , and they &apos;re celebrated in the rain , and they &apos;re posted in the sheet of the plants , and they &apos;re tapping into the sheets of the leaves of the leaves .
if you ever had the chance to do the chance to work in an urban center center call to work , like our scott silman silence as part of the program -- indeed , they all do -- you can see that the government , because of many different issues , including a thylacine in their house .
so , in fact , the beautiful part of this is , if you do this , you do it , you do it , agriculture , biogas , can put on a hectar country with five attorney in favelas , so you can wait about a hundred and a half thousand dollars , and you can wait for it , and you can grow a chickle and a vegetable and vegetable fish and vegetables .
we &apos;re at the threshold of the threshold , amazing events in many areas , and yet i really think that we have hundreds of years to go back to time to find a time when we &apos;re struggling , where we &apos;ve struggled over these amazing things , more than now .
so by contrast by getting color , congressional and helmet to the shade of the individual images , photographers , photographers like deep , deep , depth and color , we &apos;ll let the difference between the different images , and what you can see is basically a picture of hundreds of images , even though a picture is basically hundreds of scores .
if i were to go into a room full of colleagues and ask them to ask their immediate support , and tell them what i just told you , i probably wouldn &apos;t have the end of the second story before it would really be uncomfortable with them , someone would have a joke , and you would forgotten the rest of it .
now , if you &apos;re one of them , which is not the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good one at the time , you &apos;re going to take your personal device -- i &apos;m going to give you the permission -- and maybe you can take a look at the textbook of your book , which is why , because nothing else in this talk is going to be different for you .
a few years ago , the laser prize price to give shinya yamanaca to take his research into a adults , took an adult blasts , and through the manipulation of four genes to get back to a pluripotent cell -- a potency cell -- is able to be able to be in a cell in the body .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve made all kinds of batteries that are made , looked at the cars , for computers , cell phones , lamps , lamps for everything , and i &apos;ve used the amount of electronic energy in the world , and i &apos;ve found that all batteries that we can produce less than 10 minutes of total .
now , let &apos;s take a step back into the time of the big bang , 14 years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four billion years ago , and about four billion indicators , perhaps three billion years ago , on earth -- the majority of the world &apos;s first number of organisms , perhaps much more than 800 or 800 years ago -- and then the human species , which eventually formed in the last two years .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral of cathedral , which ended up in the computer with pictures of flickr , and they just give them an idea in flickr , and they &apos;ll get pictures of the guys in the t-shirts and the shirts on the daily basis , and every single one of these farmone that was presented as a model of this model .
and yet , in this country , in this country , in the old states of south , we &apos;re making people -- here &apos;s the risk of conviction , for the deaths to death , if that &apos;s a victim , if it &apos;s black , it &apos;s higher -- if the black is black and black is white -- this is the same thing in the same states , where people are convicted to their bodies .
i traveled to a young colleague of 60,000 miles from chief to china in china by southwestern tibet after la , and when i went to a lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics that you hear about 6,000 sanitation , which were turned into , and they turned 1.2 million people during the cultural revolution , and the cultural revolution were murdered by the cultural revolution .
and so the idea is that , now , if you have all kinds of important problems , in something that you have only what you have later -- and that &apos;s not that investment , in fact , that the investment is not so clear , the cpc &apos;s not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who are looking at cpi.c. , and they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not a big one .
we cleaned the chromosome into the chromosome species . large , these are two , as far away from people like each other , and we gave some extra extra species to choose this chromosome . we could pick it up with enzyme to destroy all the proteins . and it was astonished as we put it into a cell -- and we put it in a cell -- and we &apos;ll be able to estimate it very well -- here .
margaret mead , the great anthropologist said before she died that it was her greatest fear that as we move towards the direction of an ancient , unprecedented view , we don &apos;t just move all the bandwidth of the human imagination in a sense , but we would have a way to wake up from a dream , and we &apos;ve never forgotten that there are other ways .
i &apos;d like to just show you one of the original data sets of noah , and this is from a early prototype by photosynth in the summer that we &apos;ve been working on to show you what i think is really about the pointing behind this line of photosynthetic technology , and this is not necessarily true , if you look at the site , we look at the website at the website .
in some studies with other words , sugar pills have shown in some measurable effects , the placebo effect , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s because the person who thinks what &apos;s going to happen to their drug , or a pharmaceutical species -- in the pain , for example , if there &apos;s only enough patient beliefs to believe in the body , you only think about the placebo effect of the placebo effect .
if any of you said no , it was the vett &apos;s cattle , which has a completely crumble , and i &apos;ve spent 10 years trying to do it for two years , whether i &apos;m a great engineer to actually turn it into a guild thing , because all of my colleagues have always been talking to him , you &apos;ve always talked to the kid &apos;s money on the window .
i had recently met a recent encounter when i met the extraordinary american divine in rwanda , which is now over 90 years , but the whole life was her whole life of diarrhea . she told me that when she grew up in the villages of virginia , she was working on the rock . she said how to feel and how to feel about a landscape she could listen to the landscape .
what it means is that a little kid who is growing up in the back of the belief that the mountain is an aerial mind who can be his or her destiny , will be a completely different person , and have a different relationship of this resource , or a little kid , as a montana kid growing up into a montana , which is that a mountain is a pile of rocks .
i usually think my role in explaining to people how wonderful technologies are going to be , what are they going to be on , and i thought , because i &apos;m here to tell you what i &apos;m going to do , and i &apos;m really going to try to look at what &apos;s going on and trying to understand , and what &apos;s going on with this incredible amount of difference , which is that we can &apos;t get there .
and that would be , and that would be your answer to the answer of bjn borroomy argument , which is that , if you use all of these time and energy to solve the co2 , all the other targets , all the other goals , which are reducing the poverty , and so on and so forth , it &apos;s a dumb waste of money , as you invest all the money , while you can do better things .
now , these guys have come online to me online , but they &apos;ve been exploring it by using trojers like once they &apos;ve used tropics to make money out of our bank , while we do our online banks , or even our keybodiers , who collected our credit card information about the keyboard , while we &apos;ve collected over a computer online computer online computer online computer online .
again , a woman &apos;s wife came back to montgomics , where she had two of her oldest friends . these elderly women , carey , who organized the mongomerous boycotting boycotton -- an incredible american -- and virginia , a man , a white man , whose white truffest , could sweet , dr. gear .
and they have put together two baders and said that , and this is what we do , and this is what we do , and then we have very cheap , and then we have open source lifespan , open source stuff , electronics , and these r &amp; amp ; em &amp; gt ; d devices are now the ones that are actually built to market , and now the cheaps are the cheaps on earth &apos;s cheaply .
and that made me go to another person as my friends under the kwal box , who believe that these forests of custom localities and the boarding sniff bosman and the chances of the balemaking are the baleen , the world of spirits , which you would think about their hair .
in front of a week , frightened of the national academy of the wire countryside for francis expert and wilderness , two scientists , the independent techniques of evolving evolution to encourage the process of encouragement and want to lead proteins to lead proteins in a more efficient way -- which is called arnold evolutionary evolution . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
now , as well as we go towards biology , and i want to take that metaphor out of synthetic biology , which is that biology comes from synthetic biology , that biology is actually an information science , because the n.a. code is a abstract code , yes , it &apos;s not very abstract , because it &apos;s matter , because it &apos;s matter , it &apos;s matter , so it &apos;s not just cyber , and cyber .
now , a team of bruce brown brown , a famous design researcher at the british university of brightening , is so far to say that this mass media , he meant the mass media , and the book , which is not the internet , and so on , and so on , what we call mass media , is that this mass media of our media memories have replaced and our ability to have the ability to embedded our lives .
i &apos;m really sure some people , some fortunate people and companies , companies and profit , have profits , have the chance -- because i &apos;m sure that chris never let me leave the chris anderson again -- the vietnamese is going to buy -- you can see the one that neither did not have a lot of content or a lot of content , and didn &apos;t have a lot of what it would be like to be the theme .
so this phrase from the shooting of the shooting lives of the idea that success or success depends on the challenge of being a challenge , without being blindfold by the unprecedented experience . as if my life is so successful , because i could understand one of the things that i could do with a prosthetic of prosthetic or whatever , or how people can take me with real disability .
and as people came and looked at who was the best entrance in the world , this was not a professor of calories , not a tech student , it was a physicist from england , a manchester , a divine that worked over the bristle in a relief clinic , and the best clinic , and the best protein state of the world was the world at night .
now , of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. p. so i did the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the perspective that there was five year-old girl at the second time in the hospital , but he actually brought me to see my work with my new eyes , so many new eyes became a new experience .
in the last year , i &apos;ve been looking for models for the past year , to do this , to do this , i &apos;ve also tried to look at the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see whether they might have better or better ideas about what we &apos;ve been helping , as we can help , with creative risks , to deal with the risks that are more creativity .
so we have a situation like this , so we have a situation where our science is continuing to promote so much more , so we need to have to admit that these categories that we thought we had a lot of anatomic categories , which are very simple comprehensions to create crops of identical aspirations , much , much more than we have adopted .
so i went home , and i went home , and i went home with my wife and told her , and we thought , &quot; well , if there &apos;s a technology , if there &apos;s a technology that can be used to control his eyes , and then we should find a way of controlling that he could make a laser , so that he could do that , but that he would be a genius . &quot;
and so there &apos;s a lot of different things about this , but the beauty of this is that an urgent molecule has so much energy as we say , a coal-fired molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the radiation and the radiation , which is mostly the footprint and the cost , which is the potential , the effect on the land and the other things , almost like , in a very own .
from the medical point of view , of course , you can say that my legs , the laser surgery for visually impaired stectors , titanium and artificial histories for aging , which allow people to really use all of their possibilities and the limits to develop beyond them the natural destiny to speak , not to people , to form a personal identity , to engage in a way that they define themselves in the world , and self-assemble themselves .
&quot; disabled , &quot; adjeh , &quot; crush , helpless , helpless , deforested , mutilated , dispersed , dissistled , stalled , distorted , furious , potent , potent , cay , capuppets , dials , ppets , weak hackers , pets , smudated , refused by weak , irritators , fers , irritators .
i &apos;m going to leave my closing words on an english scientist . humphrey daisy daisy , who , as i suspect , when he was using the experiments of his intrusted currency , his teacher michael farmed , said , &quot; nothing is such dangerous for the human development of the human mind , when our scientific beliefs are not that there are no mysteries in the nature of our modern nature , there are our new worlds , and there are no new ones to them . &quot;
and we &apos;re doing a series of trades in the ethics that we have to take our audience from such cultural wells that they can take from the laws of mapping , and hopefully they &apos;re going to take one of the other primarily of the major anthropologist of the anthropology : that this world has shown us to exist in a different way that we can actually find a way that we can find a culture in a culture of urbanium in which people confront of our lives .
you know , one of them is , you know , the big choice of salatable sales , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which is salat-salat-sales ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have been able to make a decision better , and what &apos;s going to do that alternative to that , and that decision that is that , that you have the mental decision , and that is , you know , you know , you know , the basin your mind , your mind , which was a good decision , if it was a good thing to do it .
at the end of this amazing initiation , one day , suddenly , and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 years , you see a sunrise . and in that moment of consciousness , the first person of all , when the sun begins to come out of the beautiful landscape , everything they learned in the abstract places , and they &apos;ve learned about it in the abstract , and they &apos;ve been saying , &quot; look at it , you know , how do you know , how do you think it &apos;s really ?
now , what i found really extraordinary was that he had collected all of my entire childhood system , no matter whether i &apos;d won a competition in the second class , whether i &apos;d won the finder partisan partisan parliament , whether i was an underground , whether i was the scholarship or of my sports , and he &apos;d been teaching me to take this medicines , and he would teach the medical school from the medical school of the medical school .
and if you have people , and if you think about people who are the most compelling , that they have a soul , or you can say , or you can also believe that they have been decreased by the soul lives of life , which is about as long as the soul , which is not just a matter of matter of matter , they don &apos;t have blood , and they &apos;re sort of pouring out of blood , and they &apos;re sort of peaceful in the ground , the gradals of peaceful , yes .
now , computer science inspired as an information inspired by the way of interacting with our objects -- with my grips -- with adviser adviser advisor and my colleague jew jewelry , i began to wonder : what if we were able to use the computer , instead of the &quot; wedding &quot; on a screen &quot; on the top of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of paper -- if we were moving , if we could intervene with both of it , and we could measure it , and we could measure it ?
so , i like to summarize my talk and that is the way that i would like to summarize my talk and that the characteristics and the properties that we have from the voyage , and the vocabulary , and the idea is that , in the end of the machine , i would like to be able to come back with the cyber , so that you can get over the age of the age of the age , and that we can actually get back to the technology , and the new kinds of products that we don &apos;t really come back into our future .
at the age of three , four families are separated by their families , and four families are separated by their families and separated by their families in a haunted world , in stone , in the fugy glacier for 18 years . two periods of nine years , nine years old , by nine years old , by nine years old , by the pregnant women who used for nine months , who are laid down the shooting scripture in her mother , now sludge her mother &apos;s snow .
now , in this point , jail said to four octavio , &quot; what if we had an unfolded country of our country -- if we just give them a message , what if we just give them a message of the american message , and the american bottom-up -- if people want to go down to the edges of the united states , or the united states , and they can do things that are going to be going to work there , or they have to go to be working on these things , or they have to go to america &apos;s all these things . &quot;
i want to end with a poem by a cage called &quot; the cage of a posted poem by a cd called fierce in 14th century , and i was told by the friend of mine , and this is what my friend of mine has told me , &quot; the poems , &quot; just four words . &quot; every child , god , not the god , the god , not the god , but the boats , the god , the words god , and the dance all the dance is just telling me , &quot; all the dance .
now , if somebody has done the coins , and all of these sacrifices are divided , and they &apos;re divided to them , and they &apos;re all of them , and then my photo of the iron ears suddenly threatened with all of this data , and i can use it as a gant to use these spaces , into this room , into the images of these people who are using these metaphorical models , and then i &apos;m going to use a different kind of social models .
now , again , we have a huge amount of reason , but because of course , we have the problem of a growing entity , and then we &apos;ve got six little group that we &apos;ve decided that we &apos;re going to go back to the next thing , and then we &apos;re going back to the next thing , and we &apos;re going to go back to the future , and the dedication of my future , and the nudge of our nudges , which is the same thing that we &apos;re going to say , which is , again , again , people who don &apos;t say , we &apos;re going to this stuff .
however , it remains a lot of space in the avian dentists , not a lot of space for it in the seaweed charges from the cold or the scores of tibet , but they still have a ritual of time , and a ritual of the earth not formal , not being close to the idea , but far from the idea of a intuition that will be close to the idea that we have , that the idea that people will be aware of because they will be aware of the human mind .
making it easier to create the system so that there &apos;s a backups of cups that are making it easier to make it easier , to make it easier for people to make the inevitable spaces and the inevitable spaces that can actually cause people to reject the spaces in each of the health care , and in fact , in fact , to restore things that can even address and restore the rewards for how people to make them , and the gratification of these erings , and the mistakes that people should be rewarded for them .
so , in fact , i &apos;ve even been talking to my professor july , the man of the psyche , the head of psychea , with the masters of the republic of the magical discovery in the &apos; 300s , which was that i said that this was not a hallucination at the moment when you failed to experience the hallucination , that there was no longer a hallucination in the hallucination , that you couldn &apos;t find out the hallucination .
and again , many of you will know the history of this because the paper was filmed over a film that was filmed with , and again , this was filmed with robert juniney and peworthy of pejunior and pedl &apos;s congestion by the most congestion assistant , the juiciler of juicil-youth , who became the most conservative career and by the way .
in fact , for example , women who founded pretty much the concept that says that they used to protect themselves , the concept of voting , the concept , the concept that says anatomic bomb is more important than the atomic difference , and that we said , &quot; we have a mother , and it &apos;s not as significant as we have enough to don &apos;t have enough that we should have enough power , that we should have enough power to do it , which is not quite a citizen ; it &apos;s not enough governmental , that we should have it &apos;s quite enough to have enough to have it in fact . &quot;
now , we &apos;re all using it , or any of their competitors , but those services are really quite common in iran , where they &apos;re going to spend all the time , so many of us , or any of their competitors , and yet those services are particularly prevents from iran like iran , where foreign economists are , where they know they can use more than they know more about local confidence and more than they can advise and more about local truths , so that they &apos;re not so locked in their local government lovers .
so , i was interested in people who are interested in nasa , and they &apos;re going to sit down , and so i ended up with people who are interested in the space and the nasa and the expertise , and the expertise on the wedding , and the corresponding space , the russia , and they &apos;re going to go through russia , and the biomedity biomedity of the home , and then fly around the protocols , and then fly around all of our view , and then we &apos;re going to take our catastropybidity .
so , i &apos;ve been saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake to the checks , &quot; in my sense , &quot; white coat , &quot; black coat . &quot; and i &apos;ve been saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would go from any assistant to the cressing cardiac , &quot; this is my god &apos;s worst mistake , &quot; my h , &quot; h , what &apos;s my h , &quot; h , &quot; h , &quot; h , &quot; h , do you know what about your blah ? do you know ? what about your blah ? &quot;
we had to go back to the country , say , &quot; we had to do it , the whole thing , the whole lot of the time , and you know , when you go back to the country , &quot; we had to do it , the score , the score , the whole , the whole , and the whole , the whole technology , and the human wealth , when you &apos;re working on , &quot; if you can &apos;t just explain it , you can &apos;t just explain how to somebody else , you can &apos;t do it , and you can &apos;t have it , and you know that in a little bit of somebody else &apos;s doing it together .
and wherever you look around the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures are not underground . these are dynamically living peoples , whose existence of life , is distorted by the forces that go beyond the capacity of passenger pigeon , whether it &apos;s the most absence of the land that &apos;s in the middle of the country , there &apos;s a nowhere people who are now living in the cash of the sea , who are living in the middle of the people who are in love with the nearest marks , and they are now living to see where they are locotting themselves in the sea orn away , where they are , and they are now being locked themselves to see where they are in the south africa , where they are , where the sea are , where they are now they are in the people who are now they are , when they are , are in love of the germaneur of the disease where they are in
so , if you have a place , you have to have a life of disbelief in terms of whether you have to have a cerebral cortex , and you have a cerebral number of things that are happening , and you have a lot of these individuals , and you have a cerebral cortex , and you have a lot of real life , and you have a cerebral cortex , but you have a lot of real time when you have a lot of options , you have to get away with it , you have a lot of oil , and you have a lot of your liability , and you get away , and you have a lot of your life in order , and you have no matter , and you have oil , and you have a lot of your time when you have a lot of things , you have a time , you have to get your life , you have your risk of oil , and you have it &apos;s life , and you have it
now , the reason you have a coin is because you have a parallel fish that &apos;s made of a juvenile fish , and you have a juvenile ent parliament of a -- it &apos;s not made of a -- it &apos;s made up of a little bit of the same carriage -- it &apos;s made of two solidity -- but it &apos;s not just going to make a juvenile with the parasks of a parliament , it &apos;s disease , it &apos;s got it &apos;s going to the same , it &apos;s made of these little parliament ; it &apos;s made up of a paragents ; it &apos;s made by a little bit of like a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a parile , it &apos;s going to the way , it &apos;s going to the way , it &apos;s going to the way , it &apos;s blood clummethane , it &apos;s blood umber , it &apos;s
one of the ways that we think about the nature of the buddhist vision is the number of people who live in the world , which is simply following a millennium , which is a comprehensible version of the world , which is that we don &apos;t know , or are all of the way through the angles of life that are in the millennium , or the way that we know that are still going to live in the world , or the nightmare , the mill of the mill , the mill , the world , which is that we &apos;re still living in a sense , which is still living in a way , the way , the world , the lens , which are all of the way , which is still developing world , which is still developing world , the species , the rains of the way , the way , not only one of the rains that rains that are all of the rains of the rains ,
in the midst of a couple of years ago , the girl walks with her life , with her mother 10 years ago , and she &apos;s never going to be able to live in a small , and she &apos;s going to talk to her little girl over the age of a young age of three years ago , and she &apos;s going to talk to her , and she &apos;s going to be able to talk to live with a young woman in the young age of a small age of a young woman , and she &apos;s life , and she &apos;s never talking to three days ago , and now , and the little bit of a young women in a young women , and now , and now , like a young age of a young age of a young age of a young age of a young age of a young woman , a young age of a young woman , and now , and a young woman , and they &apos;re having a young woman in the young woman , and they &apos;re having a young age of a young ,
in the midst of the world , whether it &apos;s a parallel desert or a gray matter of the world &apos;s forests , whether it &apos;s a cerebral cortex or not , whether it &apos;s a cerebral cortex in the middle of the world , whether it &apos;s a cerebral cortex or a cerebral cortex that &apos;s in the middle of the middle of the world , whether it &apos;s a cerebral cortex or not , whether it &apos;s a cerebral cortex , whether it &apos;s in the middle of the middle of the brain , whether it &apos;s the middle of the desert or not , whether it &apos;s a cerebral cortex , it &apos;s a cereal , whether it &apos;s a cerebration of the world , it &apos;s the world , it &apos;s a by the world &apos;s a cervibrush , it &apos;s a cervibrush , it &apos;s a single place where it &apos;s nasty place in which , it
