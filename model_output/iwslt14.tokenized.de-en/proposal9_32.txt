from seattle ...
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s the singer .
but it goes .
don &apos;t find anything .
yes , hello .
we love innovation .
solar technology is ...
that &apos;s not ...
we were poor .
are these all ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
after a week .
great trick ?
we were .
some less .
and he says ...
we know that .
ta-da !
wait twice .
here it is .
that goes fast .
they need time .
music as language .
that &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... not yet .
thank you .
what a fish .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
that &apos;s efficiency .
wonderful , right ?
completely inefficient .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much .
listen to them .
the only chance .
it &apos;s not a hospital .
thank you very much .
stephen watts .
three out of 10 .
that was incredible .
thank you . thank you .
yes , kind of .
it &apos;s terrible .
long , yes .
fantastic , right ?
the sun goes up .
oh my god .
we love entertainment .
let &apos;s pick up .
after home , where ?
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we lose them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
there &apos;s a lot of stuff .
sounds that good ?
all the environmental discussion .
sounds familiar , what ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
that &apos;s great .
that was fascinating .
can i be honest ?
the farm is incredible .
what did they do ?
robert gupta .
that &apos;s the system .
this is what &apos;s going on .
yes , good day .
lento , slowly .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m interested in .
we can do that .
what do you say ?
not very sustainable .
yes , milliseconds .
that &apos;s our present .
they have similar principles .
yes , good day .
good job ! yes !
just do your job .
this was the result .
thank you very much .
and they did .
so they meet al .
it &apos;s essential .
they &apos;re all important .
very different term .
unintended .
that &apos;s me .
it &apos;s der-k .
yes , this is going .
flying cats .
this is the last one .
can we change it ?
these days are over .
these people deserve money .
what &apos;s happened here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
regarded them again .
and that &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know .
centers were built .
what &apos;s happened here ?
but you know what ?
what was the result ?
i was amazed .
it &apos;s generic .
so they knew everything .
you could see manhattan .
here &apos;s the video .
it has sensors .
why not live longer ?
he opens the door .
already a few more .
that &apos;s very good .
oh , so the one .
there &apos;s no normal .
yes , i know .
pretty good , not ?
but you know what ?
i have a question .
okay . thank you .
i stood up to him .
players don &apos;t sit around .
so you can do that .
they get worse . &quot;
so let &apos;s see .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work .
what do these people need ?
i don &apos;t think that .
i thought about it .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
they use their hands .
so how does this work ?
how interested they are .
that would have been okay .
what are media today ?
you can go in .
so where do we go ?
so it &apos;s true .
how do we know that ?
because you know what ?
it &apos;s not a country .
why do we do that ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
bg : thank you .
this is a wish .
and i was artists .
let &apos;s call it don &apos;t .
not school management .
and it &apos;s got to go back .
we can do it differently .
they even do wee .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
an immensely challenge .
there &apos;s no food .
it &apos;s against justice .
but the wrong things .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
i &apos;m a writer .
here &apos;s another example .
i forgot kids .
it feels great .
i swear it .
i wonder .
it &apos;s not going to do that .
thank you very much .
why should we do that ?
thank you .
here &apos;s an example .
you see it immediately .
not toxic in there .
but i kept working on .
or in front of bombs .
i &apos;m going to go here .
there are two possibilities .
we need energy miracle .
why does that happen at all ?
oh . a moment .
i want to tell you .
what do you want to do ?
this is what happens to us today .
and i kept working on .
so she was back .
and so it was .
yeah , here &apos;s it .
i agree with you .
and why is that ?
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what would everything have to do ?
i mean the soul .
you compare the same thing .
in china , it was different .
luckily , yes ?
but that &apos;s not a protection .
let &apos;s give pee a chance .
does anybody see something particular ?
and i always had .
very expensive mosquitos .
people were playing crazy .
what creates the illusion ?
my feeling again .
after just a journey there .
first : limits .
i created one .
yeah . well , good .
imagine the camera .
jk : both of them .
but it &apos;s even worse .
so here you see it .
thank you very much .
be a mentor .
maybe 10 times a lot .
but it didn &apos;t .
the data came in .
this is a great question .
i will never forget it .
it has billions of them .
did you see these guys ?
but there &apos;s something else .
here &apos;s another example .
is it a photography at all ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
ohhhh .
and then it became international .
there were remixes .
let me summarize .
okay , a few more .
the answer is no .
just on . a lot of fun .
my name is amit .
he had the experience .
it keeps you fresh .
this is a great question .
is that your opinion ?
almost identical structure .
and it got better .
that &apos;s what she was doing .
it has very loved it .
here you see the city .
good day , all together .
am i going to like color ?
ooh , thank you .
some have come and gone .
i don &apos;t think so much .
dk : 60,000 .
there &apos;s an old study .
it &apos;s not courageous .
the game is from 2007 .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
it &apos;s called paul open open .
what do you believe now ?
who will make it safe ?
we first have the population .
i don &apos;t like that question .
but what do your fish eat ?
let &apos;s also call it don &apos;t .
that &apos;s pre-billly .
the work of the interpret .
but where are we useful ?
they had no mass media .
how do we actually work ?
his own story .
i will never forget that .
so , what does that mean ?
now , what does that mean ?
private sphere has to be given .
there are online criminals .
we have three main groups .
it was still fish .
he always showed up here .
and then it happened again .
i felt really good .
and a lot of people forget this .
crisis . death .
it would be untested .
it &apos;s not our fight .
it &apos;s not our problem .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
why not think about that ?
we love technology and creativity .
it would be knowledge .
we &apos;re constantly rejecting each other .
and this opens a map .
but what do we do with that ?
this is in about .
what do i look at ?
his name is tempt .
will it have my size ?
that sounds crazy , right ?
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
we have to spread the message .
that &apos;s what most of you know .
you also have to understand that .
this is what you see down there .
i want to ask you something .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
i find this fascinating .
i find this fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was destroyed at the ground .
they look like this .
is it about the light ?
i grew up in india .
this is the shortcut .
you see the water coming .
i had a good life .
so what was years after that ?
who are these relatives ?
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
these changes are coming in .
how about fitness ?
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
but the key thing is , ...
he works like this .
and then they put them up .
what &apos;s actually happening there ?
the orandian trader .
they really loved it .
but i felt worse .
the two scholars came to me .
woman : transmitting technology .
very terrifying .
what &apos;s the soul ?
we don &apos;t make ourselves more .
i can say everything .
he went up and down .
what can we do yet ?
this is what the chart looked like .
i &apos;m going to get to the end .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
it might sound like fake .
we were 20 people .
that &apos;s where we are too many .
you can &apos;t have bone .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
or is it possible ?
conflict creativity creates creativity .
so what do we need to do ?
they didn &apos;t have books .
this is felix .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
thank you for your attention .
that was the beginning of the journey .
i &apos;m frightening .
and then everybody went down .
they saw the big proposal .
first longevity , second .
well , i was the next one .
now , who &apos;s normal ?
and finally , epic meaning .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
the same thing , just bigger .
who &apos;s most successful ?
you want to feed the world ?
i wanted to support them .
it &apos;s almost nothing more left .
i just loved two .
one place is south korea .
again , you have it again .
this is a natural thing .
my wife told me .
and how did that feel ?
that &apos;s what you can train .
do you make that curious ?
so it &apos;s a circle .
so what &apos;s going on now ?
this happened to christmas .
what &apos;s this thing ?
so , you know .
they could have done better .
the answer is yes .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
and that &apos;s nothing else .
is that reasonable ?
so that &apos;s the good news .
it was a huge success .
so they saw something magical .
&quot; yes , he said .
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
but can &apos;t be a problem .
and then they say , why ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
it wasn &apos;t just invented yet .
dentition should work even more .
anybody knows what this is ?
for example , this perception in context .
this is a game for outside .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
but it was very sad .
so let me remind you .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
and it &apos;s the x .
sometimes i get too much .
but they &apos;re doing the job .
they &apos;re connected to these two people .
her mother moved her alone .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
think about your own decisions .
this picture is from this place .
i see this plugging sign .
and it took 18 months .
tell me about this world .
that &apos;s very risky .
and that worked very well .
again , he showed him four .
i learned everything out .
and there are hundreds of them .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there &apos;s good news .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
that really made me sad .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
but that &apos;s not that fast .
how can we help you ? &quot;
sometimes the illusion is the illusion .
no was never a chance .
the story is not yet over .
what happened that day ?
well , then we want to .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
they come from the artists .
i shouldn &apos;t say that .
the power plant can explode .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
she did it for three years .
you can have these cloud .
the data was not available before .
game is not silly .
well , how could that happen ?
is this all about education ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
so that &apos;s what we can do .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
everybody talks about happiness today .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
play doesn &apos;t just play child games .
and that was 19 years ago .
what would you like most ?
they create a epic story .
they have so much uncertainty .
the data continues all the time .
nobody ever said that before .
so paul is a terrorist .
and that &apos;s what he really says .
don &apos;t take anything like this .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what should our beliefs look like ?
this is a lot of volume .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
i never cook with it .
she was back and dying .
and , of course , this is incredible .
and again , the representation .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
a autistic student .
when the trash is in the moment .
so not like detox .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
we depend on two countries .
everyone needs a gold glass glass .
let &apos;s go to college . &quot;
people were still happy .
it was my first sunlight .
in fact , he melted fish .
my name is brian goldman .
they divide their experiences with others .
the white lines are for population .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
he showed up to the algae .
that &apos;s just about technological .
there are four and a half thousand people .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
every waste is nutrient .
and that &apos;s where we are too many .
so the question is : how ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and it was an incredible experience .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
but there are two problems .
i started feeling better .
but , you know what ?
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
that was a pretty diplomat .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
we &apos;re in a field .
and that &apos;s what we did .
basically , they do the same thing .
this is one of the images .
what other marks act like this ?
and then something weird happened .
you can play with different kinds of ways .
the whole building was made of water .
italy wins . yeah .
on the morning , before the game .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
creativity had to be kind of out .
today , everything is easy to have .
the nurse asked the nurse .
i should probably not do that .
maybe in our cell phones .
and it starts with a doctor .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
we use the energy of the sun .
this is all metadata .
because i can say everything .
it will always be similar to you .
but slowly it made it .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work , right ?
what are they trying to do ? &quot;
further than that we don &apos;t go .
what lessons have we learned ?
and the shape plays a role .
you can &apos;t store energy .
then i can translate the whole thing .
okay , that really makes courage .
once we started a vivid one .
my second mistake was worse .
and she suggests a 257 .
we all love baseball , right ?
somehow , kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
they &apos;re going to be free to the computer .
because does anybody have a maslow ?
and then you realize it .
the other thing that other things should not suffer .
this has the largest impact .
the movement , to write it .
anyway , not to navigate .
and that &apos;s very beginning .
the truth is more like this .
do you want to solve jeans ?
that &apos;s how you can &apos;t do anything .
and his answer was yes .
her family gathered .
thank you very much for your patience .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
what else is risky ?
just be who you are .
i remember my first fire .
what &apos;s a story called ?
dark . dark . dark .
now i tried something exciting .
but most effective , yes ?
but we need the whole thing .
nuclear lever , yes ?
that &apos;s completely anxious .
let &apos;s take the quiet .
hmmm , my brand ?
that &apos;s scary .
that sounds frightening .
next : nuclear energy .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
i wanted to be normal at the time .
this is what i &apos;m going to show you now .
as soon as the judge saw me .
we can &apos;t just do that .
so i went to the court .
i got a little scared to technology .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
and there are several reasons for this .
they sell certificate .
it &apos;s not going to document .
why did i go to medicine ?
it can know where we are .
it spreads rapidly .
all adults were aware of the risks .
and i &apos;ve never seen them yet .
i like things that are different .
i went to jail -- difficult .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
this is a child game , right ?
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
and this video is in real time .
the game begins -- swiss .
otherwise , you can &apos;t have teeth .
what about longevity ?
they &apos;re just better than reality .
so the correlation is germ .
so , look what happens .
it was really changed the dynamics .
so i just started playing .
and then we said , okay .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
let me shoot something through the head .
have you ever been diving ?
this is how they learn to talk about .
because for me , it means memory .
how does he feel ?
we say in germany , sustainability .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
music is medicine . music changes us .
it turns out to be really difficult .
and you know what i learned ?
these are going to be inevitable .
but what &apos;s going to happen in the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
this has nothing to do with science .
and that can make a big difference .
but there &apos;s another reason .
anyway , we need a solution .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
so that &apos;s what i &apos;m listening to , thank you very much .
they flew the canals .
in assumption , maybe two percent .
we started out 15 years ago .
how far do you get there ?
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
do you know what neid is ?
so the first step to a interpretation .
and it &apos;s still not a interpretation .
that has to be the aging .
if you come to that , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
this is just the minimum .
we can regain our nutrients .
anybody knows what three seconds are ?
on the book and on the picture .
this picture reminded me of something .
i find them off .
sunlight and co2 is a method .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
i &apos;d like to prove that to you .
it was a pretty destiny project .
this is where the sun is going .
this is the memory .
these rivers are taking rays .
a has these benefits and risks .
our newspapers are read by millions .
lego made it possible for everyone .
privacy is not the debate .
they were genetically impaired .
i &apos;m the new doctor .
i don &apos;t take the same way .
baseball is full of great statistics .
because we live on a waterplanet .
do we really want to go into this direction ?
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
and these are the neural structures .
they didn &apos;t give the government .
oh , my time is over ?
something is going on in me .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
so we measured his movement .
this is a picture of the object .
apparently it was quite popular .
you see something funny here .
i really like beautiful clothing .
he can only use his eyes .
but the truth is far away .
you can do that all the time .
so this crazy story could vote .
who would ever be a wish ?
the dutch would have been easy .
her father died short after her birth .
we had no cents a year .
we need to increase the complexity .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
here &apos;s her marrow .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
but then you really want to get deep inside .
you want to orient in the museum ?
that was more concrete .
okay , you really want to know that ?
and i had to go out of the city .
we won a few prices .
who doesn &apos;t want healthy children ?
it makes denial at children .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
no , i mean really serious .
i think the knife in my hand .
and the goal is very simple .
i shoot my sleeping back .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
we have something that &apos;s not going on .
now , i see greg lists .
a billion people are going to starve today .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
i loved this fish .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and this sounds very different than before .
he was over six .
i started a institute .
they even get funded with a funding .
the movie was not given yet .
we need to think what marks are .
what do you do about this ? &quot;
i call that the brave .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
this is ideology , not science .
and that took me through this .
today , 6.8 billion people .
it &apos;s very simple , so it &apos;s going to come .
it &apos;s busy with weak sense .
the projections today .
automatically , he goes to the right thought .
that &apos;s how natural things are happening .
but it requires a lot of planning .
we can reinvent everything yet .
as we think of north .
and it depends on phosphorus .
often in the third end , forget .
it &apos;s longer than those two networks .
the stones are colored .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
it &apos;s about changing force .
i started with my usual talk .
this is a very sensitive question .
i learned this from my grandmother .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
we didn &apos;t write these app .
and every morning i jump .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
it &apos;s very good .
what would you describe ?
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
there are also worlds of the world .
to ask , what is the right ?
in the people over the urge .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
the living bears are the humanities .
they gave their blood pressure .
thank you , but the best thing comes .
we have reached a kind of equilibrium .
happy productivity . fantastic !
the result of this was catastrophal .
and everybody in this room needs to be in .
here &apos;s the olive oil .
bjoun sundin .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
we already have a lot of procedures .
this is perhaps going to transmit public .
my brother stared at me .
these are the apple saras .
i talked a lot about magic .
who could have looked at it ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who do you really want to inform ?
completely on a particular goal .
what do you think happens next ?
they have them . they always have .
so this is a hard ninequality .
it &apos;s now constant .
they literally put the lever around .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll show me .
most of all , when he died .
so it creates two circles .
the side product is clean water .
it sounds like that , basically , unusual .
we built unique elements here .
you always lose rare animals .
she &apos;s going to touch her deeper .
he died , broken through the story .
here &apos;s how the building works .
they went through each other .
tell you what you &apos;re feeling .
the other one had died .
let &apos;s make a little intersection .
here you have this little mechanism .
there he &apos;s collected .
the interest is caring for firemen .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
the students are divided to grades .
these things are logically correct .
and here you can feel it .
for energy , that &apos;s what i noticed .
i &apos;ve tried to understand them .
all of these generations need just a few milliseconds .
and nobody seems to rain .
that i wrote these crazy things .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
and curiosity is not going to learn .
this is also a paradigm shift .
a dalamer , right .
you &apos;ll see the back of the back .
so from modern art in the computer society .
and that &apos;s what they do .
we need to get far , so fast .
it &apos;s a new supply of america .
they &apos;re all embarrassed questions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they &apos;re the matches of someone .
we &apos;re running through initiational rituals .
now look at this curve .
wisely belong to our lives .
i forgot people in death cells .
they were inspired to be inspired .
leading some mutations .
so scott gets these fruit fruit .
we worked in the night .
so i followed my gut feeling .
he moved back to the silence .
now we saw the reverse effect .
you know , all of you have applaud .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
so ... so , not so optimistic .
he switches the process .
let &apos;s start with what &apos;s going on .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
they had a concept of blue blood .
i believed everybody could do that .
i never met him personally .
even cats look at this video .
there was jimmy drunk .
let &apos;s think about nuclear .
how would you describe your brand ?
we &apos;re talking about cool , fresh .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
no , that was what i thought .
i &apos;m a redundanced person .
that &apos;s not the route .
this is a painting of a circle .
the roof was also covered with water .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
and women argued that successful .
we can support them to be good .
look at what it does .
the main man winds me .
sexual food is in the picture .
i read the entry .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
that &apos;s the truth . i believe .
we &apos;re talking twenty of them .
it was really immensely profound .
he was shaking his head , no .
this is going to happen in april next april .
we also have very accurate data .
behind seven mountains and so on .
the mechanism comes from the gap .
but with the right design , please .
we can support them to be good .
just to say , what is information ?
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
there was never a time like this .
and even lomg thinks about it .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what happens ?
also , these sources are interrupted .
how will you feed the world ? &quot;
this is an ecologist .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
the koch had coded him .
you put it in the box .
this is a tragic part .
that &apos;s what &apos;s just been represented .
what does fifteen million seconds take ?
i see the dalmaer .
it may be , until it &apos;s invited .
maybe again , maybe a look behind it .
no , no , far away .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
156 nations send our tv canal .
they created their internet connection .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
she was not disgust .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
this is the system that we live in .
but i continued to ask this question .
and that was what i felt .
we expect a couple of extraordinary decades .
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
you also should tell you what wishes .
something very strange is happening here .
and that was the outbreak of the breakdown .
i learned some very simple things .
it can know how we hold it .
so there &apos;s a feedback recovery .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a google center .
this is a modest little app .
the ufer comes from another place .
&quot; they didn &apos;t let them go . &quot;
i lived in parallel worlds .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and i &apos;d like to read them .
there &apos;s another aspect in history .
you can be logical and intuitive .
tell me a little bit about this part .
make it possible -- you &apos;re all here .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
does anybody even know what that is ?
so this is the reason for this project .
it &apos;s called &quot; jump with me . &quot;
let me tell you a little bit about it .
these kinds of circumstances don &apos;t exist at us .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
we can give ourselves something like this .
so the first exciting primat .
and there &apos;s some kind of staff .
daniel kahneman : sure .
everybody would like to make people happier .
the dosization also plays a role .
and why ? biologically changed food .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
we now have masks in this country .
not even the truth will be free .
because now you can apply a three-sentence .
you see the timeline up there .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
but it &apos;s not just about words .
thank you , danny kahman .
we get an absolutely bottle of it .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
because we don &apos;t want genes around ?
we don &apos;t want the companies to own .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
they take the process , they understand it .
there are some things that have to come together .
and what do you do with the waste ?
bad ? i was completely confused .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and then he can walk away .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
his personal enemies of seats .
i &apos;m trying to do this for a while .
it has to work first as a present .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
this is an annual water river .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
so little-victed source is open .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
they grow five centimeters .
maybe i did it with good reason .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
now let &apos;s get something else out there .
it &apos;s all from our own pockets .
normal people are not available to these devices . &quot;
as an artist , i &apos;m very important .
here you see roberto dance .
and no matter what italy did at the end .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
but the game is a format .
thank you . i have a question to you .
he had had 20 minutes of mr. music .
now , i &apos;m going to show you .
that &apos;s just an insurance method .
it should contain the two elements .
shake the environment , make less waste .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to talk about again .
yeah . you don &apos;t do anything else than discover .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it was an accomplishment .
what you need is a new medical culture .
alone , shine and without support .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
i think our identity is threatened .
many of my clients are very young .
my cousins around the world .
we saw some fantastic presentations .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
here are two different jets .
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i &apos;ve got him on my laptop . &quot;
i &apos;m going to directly act with the artist .
a whole cool whip of food .
the difference is then perceived as a loss .
in two hours , they rebuild everywhere .
the emergency room took all strands .
no surveillance can create queues .
there &apos;s a lot of great books to this topic .
now , this was a problem for supercomputer .
this country is different from 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
you can predict that . why is that going on ?
what kind of application do i do ?
it &apos;s great that these number is rising .
isn &apos;t it half or a quarter ? &quot;
so what can we close from all this ?
so basically a translation of translation .
no tree is carbon neutral .
and further , now you see him always .
the next step happened within this communities .
he had invited every lot of natural videos .
this is just the labor worker .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
it really does solve the fuel problem .
and ecological was a disaster .
this is one , part of you .
it just didn &apos;t come before , you know ?
in other areas -- the world of communication .
this is my supermarket . no big .
but western governments are also helping themselves .
sleep manship is ubiquitous .
i &apos;m going to be tired , as we all are .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
if you burn coal : no .
you say , there &apos;s no prediction .
can you play me now in blue ?
no , we find out what &apos;s in there .
and there &apos;s a central point .
you know , everybody &apos;s got cuts .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
now , what are archaic models ?
and the list can be continued .
so , that was my primate motivation .
providing america . find more .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
it &apos;s the average power of the threshold .
we wondered , and nobody knew it .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s made us some serendipity .
and then it looks like this .
do you remember the wink still ?
so , help me do a little bit .
imagine mozart efficiency .
i &apos;m happy that i &apos;m there .
the water quantities have increased .
they worry about that we &apos;re getting worse .
man 3 : i &apos;m the guy &apos;s museum .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a license .
in fact , the instruments have evolved .
i want to tell you a little bit about this .
in fact , no viral video wanted to make a viral video .
in this three-sentence , three sentences come out .
three sentence , they still know from school .
you can zoom in and zoom out .
now i add a bass .
and that &apos;s great because we need that .
if not , jellyfish today is somebody else .
this is the machine below gene .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
they laughed more than they do it here .
your problem is you have too little .
third : escalation of expectations .
the official dogma of what ?
they &apos;re just listening to it , and they &apos;re beginning to speak .
let me show you how you work .
it &apos;s a game called the following .
i call them &quot; the income billion . &quot;
we &apos;re going to think of energy today .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
you go around and you get stuck .
you just have to spread as far as possible .
imagine an airplane full of rings .
that &apos;s something that &apos;s built in the city .
second time . end of the normal game .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
just imagine that for a moment .
raise your hands . let me see .
maybe we can see change as change .
dumb is not much better .
people were listed . people were fighting .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
you know that science is not a company .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so , that really got me out .
i tried to preserve the body .
life had not changed for centuries .
but so many people got over the years .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
my fourth technology : predictions for complexity .
the third technology : categorization .
it &apos;s got to take a thousand square kilometers .
you come to two because of it -- very simple .
you &apos;re supposed to tell me something about my brand .
it was something we knew to do .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
donnernerman : self-confidence is the key .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
i wanted to restore health after a disease .
now , if you &apos;re going to think a bit more .
what ? that really left me .
we live relational technology .
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
we have them forced . puff .
my parents are 80 on the ferences .
and there &apos;s the latin problem .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
we &apos;re talking about drinking information .
you can jump directly to a certain outcome .
you can be in a certain year .
because that &apos;s what &apos;s done with it , right ?
shake the environment , no less energy .
that &apos;s what oil sits model is .
now you see the dalmaer .
and the next one is also here today .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
this has to be down here , down to zero .
but i didn &apos;t get discourage .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
and in time , they can react again .
our goal was easy to say , okay .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go back again .
all of this is compound .
it &apos;s all in it , it &apos;s useful .
this will be balanced in china in a second .
the phosphorus problem is much critical .
anyway , they do that in the case .
the permanent ice is marked with red .
and if you don &apos;t , don &apos;t dance your dance .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
my mother asked us to touch their hand .
seriously -- the bottom line .
now , this cartoon makes some exceptions .
here &apos;s a few on the hampton .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
i thought i could integrate myself .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the three words laugh : remember ?
i remember it was yesterday .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
well , i cheat the court .
i said , &quot; ok , oma . &quot;
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition .
i work in solar technology industry .
and let me show you a simple example .
but it has an unexpected twist .
so that made sense , it fitted together .
yet we seem to be very satisfied with it .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
scott was given by man to man .
and here &apos;s every piece of very well done .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
is it about the details or the colors ?
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
nobody has to fool ideas .
motors , gear -- four possibilities .
i think i &apos;ve heard more hands .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
eeee ! no , thank you .
and this is a millionaire company .
so we need digital security systems .
so again , the appropriate really well together .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
intersexuality comes in many different forms .
so put them up ; save the shoes .
that &apos;s about a percent of the population .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
what we want to do is create the future .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
there &apos;s a lot of happy coaching .
let me show you from the next one .
it &apos;s like a potatoes .
complain . shame .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
they were just like the people in this room .
my grandparents put this number on 70 .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
we need to use more research for more research .
there &apos;s every footprint on it .
i would normally take the needle .
there &apos;s somebody sitting behind who had no childhood .
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
let &apos;s do this as if we had a machine here .
what did you think about these design students ?
that &apos;s going to be a key element of this thing .
they live with chemosynthesis .
i was completely excited about science , you know .
i &apos;m going to choose the theme of government .
and every night they fly 240 miles back .
every morning , they fly 240 miles to the farm .
what is the fueling commercial ? &quot;
natural light then comes up with smartlight .
that &apos;s what nobody did in the world .
picasso answered , wait only .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
that the ecology is a global issue .
now i &apos;m going to do something else about this .
they &apos;re all back to their way back .
and they had to remove what we did .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we just signed down .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
that &apos;s how they can &apos;t do it wrong .
what do you do with certificate ?
this is alfred gonzalez .
it can give a series of changes .
and this is very important in medical research .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
then he whispered me into the ear .
the rest of the time are delayed .
i start with some simple examples .
we &apos;ve always been trying to ask more important questions .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
the question is why people accept that .
and i went back to work .
it will be connected by oxygen and silicon .
and we increase our expectations on .
then i wonder , how could that happen ?
first of all , i thought that was a game .
the storytelling always needs more senses .
and trying to do this with another generation again .
today , a lot of people have given the government .
next week , this comes down to the market .
it &apos;s got a button . it &apos;s out .
well , it was free , that &apos;s true .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
the first is a classic , apple .
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
these things have a positive impact .
no one wanted to do with the movie .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
on the left-hand side , you see a little boat .
so i think we need to be leaders .
so we have this awful simplistic idea .
so two pairs , every one star .
ladies and gentlemen , their relations .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
it was leg beyond the imagination .
but the best thing is -- in a second .
so each concert is a different concert .
so not saving , avoid , avoid .
and everything is a package or content .
i could park my house directly . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
they &apos;re supporting other people from their mistakes .
i hired them , and i went to the treatment .
do you know how to call a 400th ?
notice two things on this curve .
and i have to say , there was power .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
at 16 , i started illustrating books .
that our contribution to the system is choose .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
he &apos;s not coming out in other countries .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
i never want to live anything else in life .
so i talked a few months later .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- this is how they walk along the fingers .
i &apos;d like to show you something very first .
and of course , it &apos;s made it click , but then .
it was summer , and i was sitting there .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
and they &apos;re not only going to die on masses .
what happened is that we could do that .
they don &apos;t spend time in magicians .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . i put it .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
anyway . that &apos;s what i want to do .
technological circles are the same .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for nine .
i put it in a particularly terrific place .
at the beginning , the mesh society is through the language .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside of people to the outside .
we don &apos;t invent identity , we invent them .
it was much less and i was in iron .
and i &apos;m going to summarize this for you .
now , everyone &apos;s trying to figure out of this pattern .
he came up to me , and he hugged me .
all of them were like this , they started to share .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you do that crazy ?
the country is going to roll them up .
so smarter , a giant theme everywhere .
and we want to make this material available for all of us .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
we want to do something against the death penalty company .
there &apos;s a few interesting developments there .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet , there &apos;s a realistic level .
so the theme of the day : fundraising .
in fact , no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
and that &apos;s what i say now is very important .
and we have to do a lot more on this device .
it happened four and a half years ago in italy .
and i say that &apos;s good .
this is a problem that many players have .
the last three of the five i &apos;ve summarized .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecology model .
memory this off , lifted the rest .
and that &apos;s what these marks have done .
well , what is marke ?
i want to help you to calm .
both of them are overwhelmed , both of them .
as i said , amanda contributes our elephant .
there was no canvas melody .
have you taken all your vitamins today ?
so this was a cathful experience .
i can &apos;t do it , but this guy can .
we already have 20 percent of germany in germany .
it &apos;s all these wind rocks all around , almost .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
the only thing they had was your head .
so for him , they were just cash .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
this is a dead turtle .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
i &apos;ve got something that i want to show you .
how would it be longer to live in good health ?
we don &apos;t want companies to patent .
and that &apos;s what i found incredibly exciting .
they have the flow of the water reverse .
so , we can &apos;t even wear these things .
in the countries where people get to money .
and what does it look like in there ?
we understood that the weather is global .
and in this head , the memory was falling .
you saw it in the news .
this is a completely unsustainable development pattern .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
now , would you choose the same urb ?
there seems to be an inconvenience .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
now they understood the advantage of prototyping .
that &apos;s the u.s. for hundreds of years .
i think the first place is curiosity .
the flamingos eat the gardens .
these were the very first computation six years ago .
but maybe you can also match them again .
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
not to be composer , of course , composer .
if you fall in love with someone , efficient ?
and we see it goes through .
because we don &apos;t feel effective money .
yeah , so what to be biohacking ?
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
there are the ones that are much more spatial .
the corporate headquarters is right here .
at one point , i thought he had kidney stones .
and back to my doctor &apos;s doctor .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
we want the number of toxins .
the swiss is obedic .
the debut of dna was an interesting step .
people seem to think about politics is sexy .
but what happens to &quot; vibrate &quot; is different .
i was not familiar with the eticket .
no apple ever cut again .
good night , south thylacine . &quot;
now he &apos;s going to get a ph.d. in the scene .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and naught .
if your job is dance , dance .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
these are records about a permanent of six seconds .
but netherlands is not always a bad thing .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
they &apos;re going to be rare because we catch them .
so you don &apos;t have a lot of income animals .
all of these things are unavoidable .
we have access to exponential technology .
i remember if it was yesterday .
and i &apos;m going to get a figure in the book .
sag , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
so every trunk was a little different .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
i put my job on 95 pounds .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
we found that it &apos;s really weird .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
the answer is probably going to be &quot; no . &quot;
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
this is something like our fight .
that &apos;s how they can move the whole movement .
here &apos;s the results we &apos;re getting right now .
but how do you do that in practice ?
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
i want to do it by not stars . &quot;
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
this is the problem that i try to solve .
that &apos;s not about how happy life lives .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
... that the domain also play a role .
probably a lot of you know here in the hall here .
yes , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s raise that .
and i have all kinds of little artifacts here .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
well , i understand that . that &apos;s what i do .
the marshmallow needs to be up .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
these stupid movies don &apos;t bring us a money .
i can take the sequence as it goes down .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
for nathaniel , music means seelite health .
well , it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
because , in fact , this man is not interested in prove .
because we can &apos;t live without that lifespan .
he &apos;s just falling it and not himself .
why am i going to afford this little car ?
a phrase with his own breath .
over interpretation is hardly spoken in class .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
it &apos;s a kind of a kind of a poker composer .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
or they didn &apos;t have any olith gray .
and that leads us to one big question .
it turns out that the reality is all without computers .
yeah , what do we actually do for projects ?
and the world that we lived in was like this .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
if you spread it , this is what happens .
and that was not a hard way to diagnose diagnosis .
i was a forced obsessive student .
all right , really good , maybe an all-star .
wealth , not debt , influenced the outcome .
she had the last word in every family argument .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
and we &apos;re using this word with such deforestation .
and in this case , it looked a neighbor .
and that worked . applause for scott .
i made the decision to move into the united states .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
or are you more like a downtown ?
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
so what are we going to see in the movie ?
you know , i had the idea for a film .
i want to tell you how we found that .
and that &apos;s the planning behind stuxwell .
i learned that in a moment it &apos;s different .
each polberg has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
look , dr. kean has changed his way .
it &apos;s natenty , and it &apos;s just nate-to-face .
we have the passion of a dictionary innovators .
this is moore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
we want to create mass incentives . &quot;
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
now we do this with drilling and machines .
this is the gay center for service and information .
and we want to put this on a global scale .
we have all navigation systems in our cars .
but at the same time , we know that &apos;s not possible .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
all right , let me show you something more about it .
here we were , and this is the painting .
emc presents &quot; name it transparency . &quot;
there was a lot of crazy things going on .
the avian age of the machine age .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same thing in the disabled movement .
but are we going to make the best of our game ?
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
but you know what you don &apos;t have a right ?
i thought we &apos;re going to take the potasmanian use .
there &apos;s a connection , a reciprocal respect .
and so i then met an unusual decision .
so my two passions flew out .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
i don &apos;t know who you know this picture .
i first agree that &apos;s logical .
i think it seems to be very important to you .
the question of death penalty is an interesting question .
the kid in me is really excited about opportunities .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
today , i &apos;m going to report unexpected discoveries .
the underwater part comes from a stone breakdown .
when i say reality , i mean real reality .
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
and how was that for you ? what does it succeed ?
a little bit more about you , that &apos;s not you .
it was &quot; in eternal , forever . &quot;
tuesday : adapting adapts totally overwhelmed .
the dog ! i was linguistic .
do you want to be attractive and self-conscious ?
she was barrier , and she was drinking blue .
people are now coming into the side of the side .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and some of it doesn &apos;t work and mankind .
so we &apos;re going to walk before , and where are we going ?
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
but the phosphorus will not replace the phosphorus .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
we wanted to develop a learning tool for language learning .
i may have another 40 years of work in me .
you know what the answer to this question is ?
if you want to make hyperlinks between the images .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not perceived as a great loss .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
this is the kind of textbooks .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a lot of studies now .
we &apos;re learning about trust and the rules of the game .
probably one of these numbers has to get very close to zero .
and i said , &quot; yes , i like to love . &quot;
you can say things here , the world &apos;s impact .
... you can just show the slide for a minute .
just as i think we &apos;re going to play a game today .
in each one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the aid doctor .
and i went over and i just stopped .
it also shows up to other places of the book .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
these results were achieved by several weeks of hard work .
this player is short before a episode .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
there &apos;s a program that maybe some of you know .
i &apos;m very grateful for the recommendation here .
you know that he was 1835 here .
and yet we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of that yet .
my mother litt lifts from the boat .
these are the people who form my worldview .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the board .
we see this in all sorts of different areas of human life .
and it was also after the three months .
it &apos;s right , morality , patentm .
the main problem here is similar to aids .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell you about reality .
have a nice concrete example of it .
then i say , heart failure , yes ?
and we often invent how we want to react .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re going to bring kids to the world .
his ganging process has changed after that .
i said , &quot; forget , oma . &quot;
it &apos;s devastating and weird programs .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is change in change .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
there are some places that we can apply to .
we called it the digital water pavilion .
because they have specialized skills of processing .
so here &apos;s a couple of natural light bulbs .
the second factor is the services we use .
it changed my way of making movies completely .
it &apos;s hard to overcome the destruction .
so you could feel like you could sell it .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
that means the ants weigh much more than we are .
and we can like to look at that now .
geek and quisle leonard cows .
so , pull them up and start inventing them .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
this is an idea that is worth spreading .
so imagine just two other small changes .
how many would a good memory decide ?
and that &apos;s the message .
so please listen to if a music is played .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell you what &apos;s going on .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logically correct .
in fact , we know that something else is the case .
now this should not be a joke now , but .
let &apos;s do that once , and then you experience the sentence .
we can do these things in different ways .
what we love to love is the cardiovascular .
they moved to a natural concept .
so these women were wearing themselves , and they were just sitting there .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and we created an ipai app .
darwines and sponsors were chosen .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzles .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you zoom in . you can actually go in .
you can see in all these museums here .
how much money is needed to save that ?
think about it . this attack is generic .
and if it doesn &apos;t , it doesn &apos;t do anything .
so we &apos;re starting with a winky drone .
he says , &quot; make up to the pronounce . &quot;
imagine a shame airplane .
it &apos;s a completely denial of error .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .
this is another view on the tree of life .
they divided the kingdom in two .
this is one of the classical expressions of playing .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
we had no child paralysis in this country yesterday .
and i &apos;ve used a while to figure that out .
we repeated this practice with the same students .
you have to be ready to take risks like this .
&quot; look at your belly , pink .
there &apos;s no overpopulation problem of trees .
then you &apos;ll notice that it has a change .
and the third area that &apos;s actually explaining by itself .
i &apos;m looking forward to the conversations of all of you .
every big picture is the beginning of a section .
you wouldn &apos;t like hunting , and you know what ?
or are you more like a downstairs ?
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
that &apos;s the consequence that we need to ask .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
wednesch : reverse your child .
play is the kitt that keeps us .
if you have something to give it , you &apos;re going to do it now .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
they teach them to open up themselves .
antarctic : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
and here are two patients . these are their records .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive cognitive fence .
i think that &apos;s true for everybody on the planet .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
so , a climate change will be terrible for you .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as designers .
clean drinking coal , you heard a lot of them .
but the volume are much larger than ever before .
it grows in winter and shrinking in summer .
not just bad , but the worst time of all times .
everybody knew your genius was something lam .
we repaired them , repair them .
and the world in which we live now looks like this .
but these are all roads in the u.s. s.a .
we dance in the temple , and we will become god . &quot;
child mortality has increased about a tenth .
this is also there , that comes back again .
maniok is something that is half a billion people eating .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
we &apos;re running into the poor of placebo industry .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
where is the biggest interest , so what do you really do ?
also , the energy source is very important for them .
we went back to the mack of titanic .
because artists have a local ratio to lie .
and at all , you &apos;ve done a lot less than i am .
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
i &apos;m never going to play more like this , right now .
it &apos;s the form of real behavior , yes ?
and less usable or user is friendly .
how can i make something usable ?
i don &apos;t see why that shouldn &apos;t be .
so how do we work when we look in there ?
every society is prevented by a primate .
and these interactive portraits are true each other .
we &apos;re now focusing on fuel generation .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built watermarks .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
they get a model that comes out of the earth .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
and she said the three words : remember you ?
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
so in other words , i really want to do what i want .
and i see the same process in combination of photos .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it was almost 200 million times a year .
they had 348 different kinds of marmelade .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction to that .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
he described one of them as a very common one .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
at a point , the screen filled with leaves .
so the pyecology movement has done .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
this year it was almost 50 million times .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
we should put the bear in the cage .
are you eight and monthly like 007 ?
the living self has no voice in this choice .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
and in the world , everything made a sense of me .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
zie , in a moment of headlines .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
and no , it &apos;s not worthy of san francisco or san francisco .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open you doors ?
here &apos;s the current version of this trajectory .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
and that was the first of people developed game devices .
as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
they never get a task that they can &apos;t solve .
i mean , i rarely saw this bottle .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
and the film is called &quot; the enabling of endeavor . &quot;
well , in this area , there are not several thousand goals .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
well , we presented the mayor hole .
well today we know all about where our things come from .
france makes a tor . italy makes a tor .
how do you divide people because of their characteristics ?
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressive fourth .
he stays out every fifth of my consciousness .
is it for other money , or is it that we have ?
so i say , let &apos;s start the world change .
edward caova is a national scientist .
right now , we spend three billion hours a week playing online .
the biggest difference between them is the transition with time .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
bg : an energy breakdown is the most important thing .
and i say , &quot; restriction don &apos;t you .
with pivot , you can dive into a decade .
but for many people , this is a little bit too radical .
so i knew a lot of fish in my life .
i understood that this is the creature of art .
in fact , the notes are very vage and unprecedented .
because we don &apos;t do things anymore .
there it &apos;s going to be more like my glasses .
as i said , it &apos;s only started to do it .
this is an interactive filman .
and olds ! make you feel in spite .
i &apos;m still going to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and everybody knew it was so functional , right ?
i would continue to do this work that i love .
and the question is , are that good news or bad news ?
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
here &apos;s , &quot; take your fingers on every single light . &quot;
the next step was to find the apps for it .
we know another one where all the tents are .
so you just go to google projet.com project .
what are the other metamare they running through ?
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brand .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
this constant feedback is not in real life .
i &apos;m going to explain it for you , and then explain it .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
a research mester for the theme of user interface .
i &apos;m also going to fix what &apos;s in there .
you don &apos;t know anything in this goldfish glass . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great things .
in the future , most crime will play online .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started .
now it &apos;s on the red list of dangerous species .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
but i really believe that after we get something even more .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of these communities .
the cell communities started to abstract information again .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
this is great . here &apos;s the digital is the physical thing .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacine .
&quot; don &apos;t get it wrong .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the brick .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s being put together .
and urban designer and construction are very interested .
it &apos;s not even online . there &apos;s no denial .
that doesn &apos;t work at all for memory itself .
our steps in digital life were exponentially exponentially .
this is star night , probably never seen this before .
over the course of this discovery , i learned a lot .
as a child , i used to draw comic books and so .
when we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
that &apos;s right now our goal .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
we were only around there as well as else .
a lot of talk about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
i was quite obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
so when the sound says , there &apos;s no soul .
this is the most difficult part in my talk .
i can &apos;t play like 20 years today .
both cases of mine , ask me questions .
so much testosterone , but no reaction to it .
so growth is accelerating itself .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my rocket .
1m is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the goal ?
that &apos;s what the weighs might be like to think .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
now , how do people die in such a hack ?
the first story is by charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and you can see this green point there in the middle .
i sold snow animals around the country all around the country , worldwide .
this is my meat , and i can turn this around .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
no , this is exactly the right , right ?
many of you are covered by faces .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
in both cases , surgery was operated , and it took them well .
she didn &apos;t have a treatable brain damage .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
and the fish also had the fortune to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
it was the missing cross against drugs .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
there &apos;s more behind it , it &apos;s still deeper .
but we just know a little bit about where things go .
ok , imagine how extreme self-motivating .
i know what people think when you see that .
ask questions , ask evidence , ask the evidence .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
as it used to be progressing on the village .
this is what happens to be the great machine age .
in fact , there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
they put them on the beatet machine .
and yet there &apos;s this mental dissection .
it could take place within a timeline .
... it &apos;s the crowdsource of crowdsourcing .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
i &apos;ve been working in a cow mining -- dangerous .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there were shots and thought , that &apos;s what ?
that means go back to the criminal lists .
so , like a human being is about certain things .
and of course , how does design impact on the perception .
for the two billion , but it &apos;s a disaster .
it &apos;s just stunning ambiguous .
anger : i &apos;m a lawyer marke .
we have abstract a abstract language .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
but in fact , it was a lot more fun in this night .
we had to worry about the lawyers of lawyers .
it was called the automatically committed stone .
ar inotar is a certified place .
now , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to do ?
he took a famous photograph . how was it ?
it &apos;s slowing down to one of our big problems .
we &apos;re looking at the process that supports itself .
what do you do ? yes . alive ? yane .
here &apos;s a short video about what we &apos;re doing .
but you can combine something special like this .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
because the images eat it for them to recommend .
it &apos;s in the museum , it &apos;s in this museum .
the idea is to overcover a digital security system .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and this is actually a conservative estimate .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain it .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
in fact , the advanced society is based on energy progress .
that wasn &apos;t a movie , no hd , that was real .
i wasn &apos;t there a long time ago with miguel .
because you know , that &apos;s a fun process .
have you ever seen a client tree ?
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i just described .
if you want to get away , go together . &quot;
providing america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
glad , the carbon will clean every day .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
so i go back and i get another view .
i filmed in war -- difficult and dangerous .
so we should soon figure out what the goal is .
we can do the same thing in fact with less energy .
when we make cities , this is actually a big thing .
when the child &apos;s born , she looks like a girl .
in other words , play is our adaptive joke .
can you imagine something that comes from taboak ?
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
you can just call a couple of names , and people will understand .
diphony , tube , child paralysis ...
this is a variation of one thing that was done .
well , the energy source is over time .
and it was an experience that couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the movie .
it caused immense jews in the control room .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a pig .
it &apos;s this bifurniture , coded taste .
the guardians eat the physical lankton .
and this is how it flows its elderly .
and then there &apos;s a whole bunch of simulations .
but it wasn &apos;t that much more than the years .
the musicians is the extension of our body .
he only lived on nearly three years .
hey , puma , can you really be serious ?
a baby needs about a sixth wind .
so i know about some of the people who didn &apos;t wear .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here to here .
it &apos;s like asking someone to beat the sun .
please follow me , because the circle will end up again .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s going on here .
this is an itic debate . it &apos;s got to stop .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
but then i thought , you know what we &apos;re honest .
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
i have a friend who &apos;s driving a passenger .
it &apos;s not just a nice petate .
and because we &apos;re getting older , they &apos;re going to get bigger .
this is the time period where you fall in love .
and today we &apos;re still very , very strong to stories .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and the predictions , as you read , are serious .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change .
it &apos;s my big , long life and fascination .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
why do they get us if we can &apos;t buy ?
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
a few years ago , i started to develop little-lished .
they &apos;re still describing them as untouched .
my grandfather was during the prohibition in prison .
she was a tape , strong woman , she had effect .
so , of course , serves us the technology .
i always start with a scarf , an idea .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
but what if you want to see the paintings ?
but my logical page didn &apos;t like it .
i just want to say a little bit about salatal respiratory .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . heart of happiness .
we also brought little-victed schools to design schools .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay bay .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against injustice .
my uncle died of alcohol diseases .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
in fact , we &apos;re also a multi-celled community .
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
let &apos;s call the animal , it costs a lot of money .
if a neighbor helps the other , we strengthening our communities .
ohhhhhh , wwwwww !
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re going to lose regalleries .
50 percent of their decisions have been hit within nine minutes or less .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and my talk today is maintained by these cognitive cognitive action .
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collectors .
open the map , and jump with a click .
you know , we &apos;re listening to a whole lot about transparency .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
you could also use ordinary design -- technology to spread .
one of my friends did it -- richard bollingling .
imagine these imaging points could really start flying .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
these are the kinds of questions that we need to face .
i was fascinated by the elephant and beauty of biology .
and i can tell you it was a changing experience .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
and this is a economist . so it &apos;s logical .
i mean , how much zealand we from our memories ?
the more money you deserve happiness .
that our survival of all of our survival is linked to every single person .
ten minutes later , the judge made a break .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
and yes , i have a task like you might recognize .
secondly , the photos should be combined the same kind of lighting .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
for example , that would be somebody who is completely logical .
and i thought , &quot; moment , that sounds interesting . &quot;
yes , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to get out of it .
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of statements .
and the movie is going to be called &quot; the enhancing of endeavor . &quot;
i &apos;m jessi and this is my suitcase .
just that i think it &apos;s more like him , not true .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll be happy . thank you very much .
but it turns out that that &apos;s not all .
i mean , let &apos;s say , why do we fight that ?
that &apos;s a lot of tode through masks , 20 hours per hour .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my death row .
because they &apos;re the ones that are also experts for taste .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
i mentioned this to miguel , and he kidnapped .
so the painter the bend of the system is better . &quot;
and then i &apos;m going to go immediately , that &apos;s unfair .
and also , what you would think about today in the mind .
and the oil will replace us from other energy .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not able to do it .
like algae -- and other awful things .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
it was completely closed that they could fail .
so that &apos;s the right thing to me , and i wanted to get more .
and immediately , i see a different pattern that makes .
yes , this is a down there .
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
we &apos;ve now been using us over three years .
and if possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the strange ones .
i know now that it was the reason of the ocean .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
i studied wife &apos;s printer , and she was in breathing .
and the time i collected more and more knowledge .
we &apos;re talking about 300 , if there &apos;s a bat 300 .
in 2010 , we had just connected to two billion people online .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our justice system .
and the lighting the way through the rest of the book .
&quot; because they &apos;ve been talking for tomorrow , &quot; he said .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropes .
this approach is all new , which we &apos;re doing creative .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone here in this audience .
now , your life of self will not be happier .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
here &apos;s a picture of a crane in kentucky .
he &apos;s got a weekend of 15 .
i can say the kanzler is a man .
we &apos;ve been moving in the so-called bird age .
this is about 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
this is the audience that we just recently finished .
somewhere here is a series of photographs -- here they are .
but you can see if you &apos;re in an outbreak .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t seem more human .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
or do you want to be more powerful , more power .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though that &apos;s what you &apos;re hearing .
my great-grandparents died when they were 60 .
now , where are we going to go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
this is , in a way , you &apos;re all in the front of the dolphins .
and of course , it can never give you in germany . &quot;
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
and the more openness i talked about , the more i should tell .
and i celebrate , i wine like a little kid .
obviously , that &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
if you &apos;re happy , you attract other happy people .
players are in the spiders of spider social networks .
how can we transfer these feelings from play into reality ?
so the same , bad team of a team under the best .
the fact is that this uncertainty should worry about us .
so the people in the west have really been thinking about creativity .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
one of the results was that the telephone was never broken .
the depending on his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
a few months went over and i had just forgotten everything .
even who kills someone is not just a murder .
the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
and this video was actually finished in january of january .
each of these topics was , of course , lots of smaller decisions .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing time .
today , i want to tell you about circles and openings .
they &apos;re clearly interacting with their environment and their experiences .
these trick can lead their friends and neighbors . thank you .
you know , there were no mandarines in paradise .
yes , i &apos;m very excited to be involved with you .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting .
i &apos;m sorry that i have to cut so much .
second , what economists call permission tuna east .
and i think that &apos;s what the world looks like .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
so it has nothing changed , and yet everything has changed .
we just transferred the 7-billion-dollar marke .
then let &apos;s get this analogy into the future .
so if you could do the light again .
it was a store called draeger &apos;s .
are you so far ? you see a little bit nervous .
and when i turn around , the finger changes his position .
the things that are used only will be used in technical systems .
so the device that you see there doesn &apos;t work .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
they did that by serving the country .
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
they &apos;re called the fear . they &apos;re going to welcome the risk .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
there &apos;s only the second best , just the fire .
they can throw away from them , where they go and stand .
an amazing error . one of nine unguessed guilty .
i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually going to end up with a rolling ice age .
this is somebody who &apos;s safe in the rest of four .
we used to be used to that things happen linear .
i had a 14-year-olds , poor black young black boy as mandela .
they &apos;re in there , they want to go to the end of the gangs .
and then people could eat this and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
because that &apos;s where the ownership &apos;s going on .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what do you feed ? &quot;
and then we started negotiating insulin .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
i explained what these daughters might have meant .
that &apos;s why they help with , ask for the people .
but also , our perception itself is disappointing us .
and other example are the ambitious systems , intelligent systems .
how many doors have the house where you live in ?
we think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also smelling .
i believe in this , and i feel that we should teach this .
and i guess many of you have done this too .
some people were disappointed that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
i sent them home without talking to my doctor .
the cost of solar energy in the last 50 percent last year .
we have to let ourselves go to the machine inertia .
there &apos;s a direct decline for this .
the software of software takes place in the rule of a few years .
and sure , we can find fastoms .
cats look at cats looking at this video .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
and what happened was that i needed a experts .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned swimming language .
i just wish i could see my kids growing up .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
it has moments of life , one after the other .
and i translated them to fund a expedition .
we &apos;re talking about the fluctuation of information overflow .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineer collective collective .
this is already in the first year half of his advertising .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
so they move around and make art installations like this .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
i was shocked and tied to the inside .
i went through the emergency department on my way home .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re a special thing . &quot;
i say that because i think identity is very important .
because all these new technologies of today are eating themselves .
because your life depended on whether you did the job right .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
i knew she had come to give up .
today we don &apos;t just find genius on something , we &apos;re doing .
a typical walmart offers you 100,000 products today .
do you know how many decisions do you meet in a typical week ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you is what truly amazing .
in the pre-example , it was about finding individual truths .
he said he didn &apos;t . he will ask questions .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought to you .
if they didn &apos;t move anymore , you get them burned .
wouldn &apos;t you want to do this change in your genes ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
again , what potential would we want to call ?
i say we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , two reasons .
if we looked at how emotions are varied with income .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
there was no christmas trees . we did it all .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health system is mimics .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
the one farm that your animals don &apos;t feed their animals ?
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not so sure .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
the words , as long as his friends , spoken his .
and we found that , in fact , there was a context .
do you know how many decisions do you do on a typical day ?
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
so the driving force behind is the cybersuperpower .
i didn &apos;t touch two years with my wife .
the pilot did the machine after the hudson river .
the openness is , death is a part of life .
that keeps us at the distance and lets us continue to evolve .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
it &apos;s about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
you see the person who &apos;s wondering what &apos;s going on inside .
most of my activities , i have two hips .
it turns out that dna synthetic synthesization is very difficult .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we &apos;re thinking about our future as predictable memories .
now , the memory itself is a storyteller .
what it ruined was the memories of the experience .
we &apos;re going to meet ourselves in the next few days .
there &apos;s a step-up pro-approximation there .
this happened . not a team had a stable structure .
a fish up , but also a bird reserve .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love story .
the first thing that was more like a passionate monkey .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s disappointed it .
because the music is a language , and it &apos;s a language to communicate .
and most importantly , what &apos;s the right thing to do is question .
but i &apos;m just going to do it a little bit more curious .
i started thinking , i should just put the project in .
we can , of course , first , look at the problem .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of platform .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take you away .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
just to precise time newspapers , they agree .
if the museum gave us the picture , click on it .
so you can ask : how happy is that life itself ?
most of you will completely ignore from memory itself .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have any consequences .
has a single one in the audience ever seen somebody dying ?
it &apos;s the question of whether you can get that to zero .
you might like to test it to my talk in your immune rooms .
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum of all , very many ideas .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
so that , in every store , you can get the things back .
so the question is , how do we go with these wind ?
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
so , for example , shame , the environment , fewer car .
and the lives lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
so if i put them on the side , that &apos;s what you &apos;re interested in .
i look so much like i could just write a song ?
she said it would be like a donor of air .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
they add a blue on a green one , and they can make light .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition goes very quickly .
yet we &apos;re still going to be on the galapagos .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
it was fear of terror that shaped her life .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
we have a lot of cells that are not related to themselves .
you make the mistake now , and you pay very much later on it .
and what &apos;s below is what we call bureaucracy .
but where would the next aed to help this patient ?
you have to make 62 different decisions to design your car completely .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t that easy .
almost like we were going to prepare our lives for us .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego room .
i was the only one who could talk to the aircraft .
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
think of this as a visual point , as a flying point .
but bonobos show us the other side of the ocean .
this is a fascinating adventure to this .
this will affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
we found that in terms of happiness on the happiness of living self .
they fall in their judgments . more they never do .
most people usually start to orient themselves for the task .
you &apos;ve got to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
if you walk , yes , every footprint destroys the ground .
if we run it , we can get a little back .
the most powerful mindset is the head of massey .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
there &apos;s a lot of magic . i don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a book .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be worse .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
because through marine protected areas , we basically restore the past .
i &apos;d like to finish with a story that really excited me .
sometimes i lift the equilibrium . a story to end .
i found that technology was supposed to make magic and not kill .
so now we &apos;ve reduced the time scale .
so today , evolution can happen at the time of microseconds .
here , he lifts a rare equilibrium .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
we could reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i &apos;m not going to take all of you on this journey .
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
car colors , outside of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
they don &apos;t even come from the museums .
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
i became the miracle part of this day not to die .
it &apos;s called eyemen , and you can see the description .
this is the average size of a greenland ice age .
i mean , what does somebody do with so many output ?
and as a general term , we can use the word &quot; internality . &quot;
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
we all have to believe in the last thing we can &apos;t see .
we call it miguel . in fact , it &apos;s called miguel .
because he doesn &apos;t know what way to do , first of all .
and then the same thing happens in a good , excellent conversation .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
we take images of these ministers in detectors .
economists call this a parallel improvement .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
this is a whole book , an example of non-image data .
and of course , we all share the same adaptation .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the fin of inotar .
there are cases of accidents like this from inotar .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
innovation , creativity , creativity and development is not just from our heads .
i want to help you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
ceos are something about average . but here &apos;s interesting .
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
one of the evidence by the way , is that men are not pigs .
this deputy ran across the older black black .
i don &apos;t know how empathy people will be .
you go around the block and you take it as an openness .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the temple room .
bonobos are together with our next living living relatives .
the first of these fall is a contradiction , complexity .
they &apos;re investing a lot of their time in the assembly structures of structures .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little it will support .
normally you &apos;re just dancing and some of them , not .
now he mentioned the mineral needs of physical lankton .
i take the breathing of the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
you know , that &apos;s the real truth behind the escape .
but the question i want to throw up is : why not ?
and the best thing about this is , perhaps , what we expect in health .
this is technology supported innovation that there are today .
and i thought that &apos;s so hard , so painful .
wr wants to help people who were convicted .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
how did he get to look at this particular kind of way ?
let &apos;s quickly jump to moma , again in new york .
tempt will be part of the show , which is pretty degraded .
we produce androws , and we talk to androgenes .
and if you made it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
that &apos;s scandal , and we should be ashamed .
and this is the value of this experience , this kind of simple exercise .
but while they talked to different people in this world about these possibilities .
today , they have a renewable energy from five percent .
and they did this with something called leadds maps .
but the key is , if i have right , it &apos;s just true .
so i &apos;ve been busy looking at when what is natural or intuitive .
and that &apos;s just the biohacker , the individual people .
it means that we are reaching a cultural impact next to the scientific .
this struck me when i wanted my jeans to exchange .
he invited the king of sideam to the dinner .
but somehow we can do it from this problem .
and that &apos;s also what i had in the last year .
but instead of being in panic , he just stopped .
how about both tears we can &apos;t even predict ?
if you look at the people you have to do it .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
imagine that every single person is driven by people .
okay , let me give you a little blood for you .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
new investments to create good jobs .
six : social diarrhea . seven : 65 deaths .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with me like this and play .
that means that the players are safe from 10 to 10 .
a long time ago , there were gray whales -- 500 years ago .
in many , you &apos;ll say , the ones are crazy ! that &apos;s good .
the x interpretation of a piece of a piece is this comparable .
from my eye angle , i saw the mayor and down .
i always found light bulbs in a glass .
for example , this picture has about 10 billion points , i think .
so i decided that when i was 15 , i was a diver .
this is a bigger one . we &apos;re looking at it right here .
and within less years , lego went to every household .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
by the way , i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a lawyer .
and i want to show you my output for this week .
56 percent of all ratios don &apos;t come before .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-assembly .
i asked him how he became such a fish experts .
there was the nuclear research system called opoldshadshadc .
from that time , anecdote talks that you might know .
it doesn &apos;t need to sing a loan or singing .
and sech10 milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is a lot further back in the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
so i think it &apos;s a very uncharged hack .
i think it &apos;s kind of like a sixth gram or something like that .
it &apos;s actually just about two thousand really figured out that these networks .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
so this looks like a basketball plate .
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i haven &apos;t left me .
well , in fact , the number of violent crime has not changed very much .
i first eaten him in a restaurant in southern spain .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity .
it was always so inspiring , so refugee .
the death penalty punishment in america is defined by irretters .
turned the ticket on the side . went home .
alone this airport has a surface of 100 square miles .
i like things that are weird . i like special things .
this is my brand in my little , broken industry .
so maybe you should put a little bit on this interview . &quot;
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leaders .
here you can see an excerpt from this attack -- code .
we &apos;ve got his bed , so he can see out outside .
we &apos;re degrading a person who has value for our society .
we &apos;re going to make a play to get the suffering of the real world .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take this . why not ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : it &apos;s .
the secret is that the game is to be the key to these skills .
this is actually the real melting of human and machine .
a few . probably a lot of people like there are creative people here .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
they produced the highest construction in the worst time .
it &apos;s about five tons of sound on the planet .
i grew up with a caviral science fiction .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re going to build siv , not intense .
so here was finally a company trying to do it right .
the components are getting more and more to the friend you live with .
and i &apos;m not so sure if you &apos;re really stuck .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little flight .
there was , in my opinion , a very good code .
in fact , nasa showed that there are many of them out there .
they increase the paralysis and the satisfaction .
well , i wondered how can i really get this ?
it &apos;s an independent area . they &apos;re controlling all minerals .
the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical world view .
somebody was broken , and they had founded the system .
photos like this : a building around a lot of bicycles .
the biggest fear they had , rape , rape and death .
so it turns out to be very hard to get out of all of these extensions .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange landscape .
but it &apos;s a very good meditation opportunity .
i brought seven pants in , and this is all .
but a lot of people start in a very strange position .
our gut is a wonderful host environment for these bacteria .
now , the two species of the self throw two terms of happiness .
well , life itself lives his life continuously .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness under research .
it &apos;s just a bloody calories . it &apos;s mics .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
ah , the majority . that &apos;s what i like to see as a doctor .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s about 2,500 years .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
now , what does this have to do with placebo effect ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
it &apos;s the renewables that they &apos;re often called .
this is a fish in the south western corner .
because i &apos;m asking , how do you think that was diagnosed ?
the notized notes have the function of the letter of a writing .
then these are the allies of the pre-industrial cultures .
that means you &apos;re navigating about sound and rhythm .
so this is just a application of many that you can do with it .
and then we did this kind of coherent coat .
on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
should i write this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
that &apos;s what we call perceptual design .
54 percent of the deaths through the drill .
basically , the concrete stone became the building of our time .
it would be like a new set of new , never before .
how can a judge someone turn into something that he &apos;s not ?
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lynchmobs .
so , in fact , programs that can be carried on the former numbers .
for example , the fish were recorded on an anglorious flight .
possibilities that were not allowed to have been encouraged .
so i made a couple of years ago to do that .
finally , we should welcome the fear .
a remarkable , marke marke . how is your marke ?
why is it important ? what represents the red ?
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free from limitations .
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
well , in this night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
and the key indicator for this is the extinction of languages .
and i had to explain the journalists that there was not that test .
and this is called androgency receptor .
we &apos;re developing ourselves to collaborative , heart beings .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
at the moment , they &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
and soon , i wrote an article about technology , which was a way of changing food .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
so i offered a $ 10,000 price of software for the winner .
one day this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
there was no piano at the time when the instrument was in the instrument .
you learn to find the sounds on the instrument .
even if you were to shoot , you would have emissions .
most of the people know this from the software program .
this is even live on the internet . you can test it .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nunavet .
but nothing was invented that would let me go back until now .
and the best thing about it is they connect with magnets .
some of my claims happened in the last five years .
i looked into the rocket , and it was a little bit of pink .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular tonight .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
so the dramatic numbers come from the prisons of prison .
i spent some talks in germany about death penalty .
a child in india says , &quot; today i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know a lot about government when i started this program .
this is my win-wagging . a very simple thing .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
what context is to think about the thoughts and feelings about them ?
and if the endangered is dangerous , then really bad things can happen .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
they &apos;re talking about nature &apos;s power to tell us who we are .
if we don &apos;t actually take phosphorus and give it off .
this piece 50 years old technology became the magic thing for me .
but for youtube , more than 48 hours per minute is invited .
if you could do it for the people , you could also help me .
and it just disappeared all of these companies , one after the other .
i &apos;m sad that we never know each other as adults .
think it &apos;s free , none of us deserve .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big thing .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individual capitalism .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individual capitalism .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go to the house .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
specialized skills and processing skills and their combination to success .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
and somehow , we need to make change that are going to be on zero .
we find other weird things about what their rights are .
that &apos;s the time of most perceptions we have .
this is our youngest taster down there on the right .
by the end of march , the lhc will be functional .
and that &apos;s the message that i took in medical school .
do you know how to call a 3,000-year-old league league ?
i think in many places , the opposite of justice is the opposite of poverty .
if someone &apos;s lying , it &apos;s not just a gap .
and so i think the ted community should be tailer .
and she &apos;s spreading , organic , of course .
my friends from honduras asked me to say , thank you ted .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
well , finally , the film has a very big impact on it .
in fact , this is just a period of 2 / two weeks .
these people will be connected to the film in forever .
so all these green areas , these are the most target environments .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; session . &quot;
so unfortunately , we have a piece of god to virtual something far .
i got to the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
in the short time here , i realized one : ted has a identity .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make you very , very tired . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good percentage of intuition to actually do experiments .
in my opinion , i think , mass infections have changed our world .
this is all reality today , and in the future , will be much more possible .
so this allows the games to grow from binds , trust and each other .
here &apos;s what you &apos;re talking about , the better .
people said , do you have no fear to succeed ?
i don &apos;t tell you what you &apos;re talking about , but i can live with it .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely unbelievable .
i love this : &quot; watson enforced human enemy . &quot;
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very serious .
three months later , i moved around , and the adventure went on .
it &apos;s about creating scarcity surfaces .
i like a lot of black colors , lots of gray daughters and such a stuff .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
we want to use this as a possible impulse for the flyup .
and the question was , how could you connect technology , new technology to this ?
for example , i don &apos;t want to give you a fish like a human being .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast .
i played the first sentence from beethoven vens .
man is supposed to have a common ancestry or a common ancestor .
and according to seventh , f and b , etc .
how were his life sum , how about society and politics ?
on september 10 . september year , the machine went to the first time .
we have little-viated kids , and they &apos;re going to play with it .
and when i heard her , she made keucky sounds .
and i was good , i finished with claughter .
but if i ask you , how about your wife ?
you collect information about the piece in the seven-literate literature .
there are lots of people working there , and they can all be engaged .
but how would it be if the picture they connect to all their images ?
you say that you will never forget the names .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other regional technology .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
we should be able to rotate everything we want .
and i tend to see wishes as my shadow .
and in a way , studies have been conducted to see if that was true .
and then you can see what huge speeds are there .
it comes from asia , from asia , where all the japan comes from .
because a good engineer has either built great cars or nuclear power plants .
that was the very first beginning of a musical expression .
you can only have zero-leys if you &apos;re not there .
it &apos;s good . the question is , how is it going to get us .
they rented their telephone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
the official faith of all western industrialized societies .
&quot; do you remember the patients that they went home ? &quot;
we live on a planet , which is 70 percent covered with water .
now , they just dive the apartments from the cities .
because to lie , they can just apply these logic wrong .
often the music class is so much that you learn to read the notes .
that would be just the letters that you learned to paint .
eight : tsunami warning . 9 : cyberattacks
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
bruno guisi : mark , mark , come back .
right now , when it seems hardly appeared , maybe the most important thing .
so we don &apos;t have to control people to be bad .
there &apos;s now all of this rumn before the big condom .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
they knew any bits and bones that they had to attack .

here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i &apos;m sorry .
and the color daughters and pisses may remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
it &apos;s probably the smallest of 21 aps that have written the rocks in the last year .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more worth building than it costs to build .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics says everything is connected to everything .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this has been mentioned so often .
that can be in our case that we use it to design it and create a symbol .
if you turn on the light , it looks like we saw it before .
imagine if the screen could just appear in different formats or bigger , in different solutions .
so i started thinking about what it is to make us play these games .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to attack the needle .
and what the marshmallow is doing , it helps them identify .
they do that because they can follow the white line of the landscape of the road a92 .
i &apos;m convinced you &apos;re kind of a nostalgia , too uncomfortable thinking .
and what we can now read almost every day in the journal newspaper that you find in this third sentence .
an example of another area . monet has painted the seax once .
and i want to say to protocol that i was here today for my part of the jobs here .
this was our first attempt to start with the digital information , the genoms of the genomi x 174 .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique case of the love , the rhythm of the tanks in every culture .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order in which this information is represented .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true today that less is less .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera would mean that we wanted to do a backpack .
so for example , the number 164 sticks out of this code , you can &apos;t see it .
no , they don &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just that architecture is almost disappeared .
if these points fall down , they can write on it , they can show patterns , images , text , text .
our cities have been tested in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
for bonobos and people like that , life is not counting and claws alone .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decides .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this rotated stuff like manifesto .
to become part of the constitution , but it has to be approved by congress .
you put an executive strator on the team , you &apos;re going to be better .
bill gross has several companies , among others called esolar , who has the great solar panel technologies .
one is the energy source that these technologies generate dramatically as the power of power .
that is , 15 pounds of wild fish are needed to get a pound tuna .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s in a normal , normal electrochemical battery .
a television or a washing machine that they use , yes , they don &apos;t need them .
in a sense , the arctic ice cream is the battle of our global climate system .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view that the fish knows something .
and this was an example of what our own governments are using against us , the citizens , the citizens .
we want to fight anticipation and discrimination in the punishment system .
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually recorded .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
and what we actually did , we , the humankind , is we started to abstract .
that &apos;s because the government is on the ocean , and politics are the top 150s .
at the end of one day , i made a huge top soup that we shared .
something as profound as our identity is now a question of what this slide should show .
and that &apos;s a great conceptual model of the world , so long they &apos;re not a partial physicist .
either you &apos;re going to have &quot; flood &quot; or a &quot; paradise , &quot; you &apos;re going to have the choice .
you can &apos;t just be enough to emphasize how critical this factor for the quality of a human being .
by interacting the toxins , and it can interact by the way , he can interact with the characters .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no hills in their treatment .
it came to me as though we were sending our eagers and cameras out of it .
how can we hold them longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times .
and by the way , the side rose genes , which are viriculous hormones .
i was the second volunteer in the brand , so i had a pretty good opportunity to get there .
and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution are slow down , but they &apos;re insurance .
players love to become part of the provocative planetary planetary .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are master-player .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 20 percent of the phosphorus phosphorus worldwide .
in china , there &apos;s a afternoon today called honey deadly , you know , yes ?
it actually started a couple of years with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
and the preparations were enormous . we had to build cameras and start building all kinds of things .
but what voodoo does so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
because obviously , a animal that was very often there , first of all , before it dies .
and sometimes when ted comes to ted , it gets a meaning and force that it would not have .
you have to make the sound of the winds , you &apos;ve got to read them away and read the rest of the book .
now , i &apos;m a optimist , so i think i think something in the way that &apos;s going to happen here .
they &apos;re not fighting this fight that we &apos;re all fighting about who can be talking ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
you may think that &apos;s just a landscape , and the lower part was manipulated .
and the next puzzle is about four women in three generations that build together a new life .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is , but you know what ?
just to give you the view , i zoom out , so you can see what you get .
and as part of this , they made us a concept of anatomic commons .
or are we going to be able to become something else -- something that might be even better at the environment ?
i really hope that we play significant games to survive on this planet in another century .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing and seventh self to us that can afford it .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same ratio as we used to progress .
the idea of this is obviously not only , the machine services in the control room .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- really made me out of the socks .
these gray boxes are not running with wind software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
now , when i was a neull in college , i had my first biemice .
and this is half of all the waste problems around the world that are caused by the textile industry .
this is almost free to be limited -- maybe for the fish , definitely for us .
in this country , there are longevity for children &apos;s lives without punishment .
here &apos;s what we need to understand under a policeman &apos;s correction forever .
we need to prevent people &apos;s knowledge of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
that &apos;s the only thing i do differently and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .

so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most of america &apos;s children &apos;s book .
the next puzzle part shows how a boat is running in the early red red lake .
it sounds very spaceship , and it sounds very much like science-fiction fiction , i know .
now , if i &apos;m going to talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
so that &apos;s probably going to be or weak academic , fisheries , a part of our future .
both of these are strong fuels , because we don &apos;t really look at the problem as we should .
on the new day , she lifted her -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
and also , despite their logarithmic record , it &apos;s on the left side of the left .
michael jj. nelson &apos;s mystery science theater was one of the first ones that made a joke about it .
so we also understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , very simple trick .
and this is how you see animals that are right next to 500 degrees celsius that they can survive there .
so , in the kind of shifting of evidence , they experience the great gap of lies .
now , in a few flat lakes , in alaska , even out of the water .
for her life , her life gave her a job : the tide of her family and a new life in australia .
and in reality , when we fail , when we fail to obstacles , we often feel different .
to these archaic models , we heard that we have a principle of natural relationship to virtuality .
as a child , i had collectors of chickens , stones and brakes .
and so , from the interest in this technology , i just kept on going on there .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed an egypt package , which is at spaceship temperature .
unfortunately , not in openness , but maybe you can help the france in france a little bit about it .
in high school , a student said that brian goldman would learn for a flower .
i &apos;m going to get to a statistics that i hope most of you have heard about .
so if we look at the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and like a lot of people , i thought that in the government , it &apos;s mainly about choosing people in an amt .
so it &apos;s all the tools , and the only thing that we live is our imagination .
if somebody asked them to describe their brand identity , their brand personality , how would they be ?
so basically , if you look at something , that &apos;s impossible , then you can do it .
because the lesson i try to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let it go .
and maybe we know what wood we &apos;re doing when we &apos;re really scared .
a third sentence that immediately appears at people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
it &apos;s called the elderly law or just recently psychology that affects us in perception as well .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re sitting next to the ownership as an age .
all of this takes the ability to accept our basic ability , virtuality as a real life space .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want our story to tell us . &quot;
i can accelerate all the sequence by putting the pace into one or another .
this question was so clear that we decided to do research on the answer and the answer .
we say , &quot; computer , generator please have a hundred million randomly chosen sequences of instructions .
they make methods that are easy to use , and they start with this one , patients in the team .
and i think the most important point is that we &apos;ve stopped talking to our patients .
so maybe we &apos;re going to sell a shoe , and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe you &apos;ve ever met ...
why not have the fast muscle fibers that will allow them to run faster and longer ?
we know that we work as human beings , if we worked hard , significant work .
we know from this study that you have to access to the needle if you want to go to the thing .
i brought you an example of the northeast america of nootcom indians .
maybe to an aging understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of creativity .
we now have an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century so that we can predict the development .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privileged privileged , silly , from mountains .
so we could just end up with the world very simple , maybe even hundreds of new cities of cities .
when i went back 27 years later , the fish on the size of its size .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , what happened to the $ 7100 ?
it &apos;s almost physically impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing light red .
do we use these decisions to form a society that &apos;s better , the successful is , the friendly ?
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change your cells ?
this also makes the value of this speech , so i hope that hatred you .
but in fact , my research institute at the future is exactly the opposite .
nothing passes in my sleeve or comes out , not a trickle . and you can study everything .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics that made me have no fantasy at all .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of mammals , often known as &quot; migration reactor . &quot;
i remember last year when i brought mosquitos and somehow liked the people .
it &apos;s important for the age that most of the time in the first semester , the great laws of laws .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water out of this melting water .
that &apos;s great . the tube didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
the viral particles were released by the cells and came back and killed ecoli . coli .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve adapted this point for a long time to make our choice better .
well , you can see , in all cases , no one has to be a slowing candidate .
most of the mass incentive in this country didn &apos;t really exist in the class of violent crime .
this reference is going to prepare the money to invest in more security and security .
police officer came in and prostate forests and offices and offices .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write by hand .
so for me , it seemed to be more like the photography , to be at the right place at the right time .
and this sad form really formed in a thought , which is that i just want to get a wish thing .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been for 500 years , as i have to say , very successful leadership .
you don &apos;t sit around and you throw around . there &apos;s always a very important thing to do .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we need to keep in our experience .
do you say that there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that different things ?
that &apos;s sort of the deadline that showed us the environmental models that we need to hold .
and also the ones -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some parts of it .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re not going to teach them . in fact , they &apos;re not even going to leave the glass .
so many people come and look at this because you can see what problems you get .
they heard about this book from charles darwin , the emergence of species and the degradation of the people .
i honor my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , oma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
evolution is all about the genome of the genome on the next generation , adaptation and generation to generation .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital , just amazing -- until my physicians .
well , if i had ever opened the folder with the 600 images that i had spent another hour .
people are sitting in their faith , and that &apos;s how you can &apos;t free them .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design workshop .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor , which seems to be hard , but maybe they say that about us .
this is what we see again , again , this is the elevator , again , the whole , single lady .
overwhelming : now , i can sort of interact with the object , i can zoom out again , zoom in .
first of all , it &apos;s very banal , but it &apos;s so exciting when you &apos;re busy trying to deal with it .
because often people , they can &apos;t make it useless so that everybody can deal with it .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of rabbit and boss .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it will make a huge challenge .
if you break the gold glass glass glass down so that everything is possible , it &apos;s the satisfaction .
if i spend in a room -- like right now , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking about me .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to be in the court and wear this crazy case .
recently , a study was done with ceos where they saw a week for the ceos .
so we overwhelmed our brains , because our brain is not just that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future , come back and get to life differently .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
so we have the memory itself and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
unfortunately , that &apos;s the whole good news , because there are some other problems , and they have been often mentioned .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing their lifestyle .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i only got two years later , when we moved to california .
so you need for the learning process of music at least as long as long as the spoken language .
so we had to develop a new method with which we could put these little pieces together , and we could correct the mistakes .
we &apos;ve done it on about a hundred genes to the 500 or something that are here .
and this really brings up these ideas , these limitations for the visible place on the screen .
and it &apos;s humiliated to think that our species may have existed for 600,000 years .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that are going to us .
we developed an app for layar , expanded reality to find these aeds .
by the way , there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m going to tell you about , working on the wireless .
we use this great euphemism , try and error , which turns out to be meaningful .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that had happened since the launch .
so if you want to be lucky to maximize the two species of self , you will end up doing very different things .
as peter peter told us , not only did the highest turkey , but also the most interesting structures of all .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper ; he doesn &apos;t have a pen ; he doesn &apos;t have any crest of the record .
we hope that this doesn &apos;t mean pop-ups and other profits -- that shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
the grandfather of man didn &apos;t worry about the arctic night or the weather storm .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 rocks for each person on the planet .
and to win , the device needs to make a better diagnosis than a team of high-quality doctors .
the founder of my view was the original anatomic activist , so that &apos;s why .
they were playing a rocket game , and the seventh to break down a episode of adventure .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are the success of scientific method .
it would have been without the space requirement , but the power is so much more important .
certainly , i would never do an alien world with a spaceship , which seemed to me pretty unlikely .
we &apos;re not going to answer that right now , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen at the moment .
all right , just to conclude , i want to notice that i talked a lot about the fathers .
you know , when the film comes out , we might see a hormone volcanoe .
what are we going to do with the fact that we &apos;re just going to distinguish ourselves from just a few of nucleotides ?
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then increase my strength and permanent .
but if you &apos;re in a episode adventure and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to get the oil out of it . &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have never been there before , we would have had the potential of human potential .
and that &apos;s going to get worse , and pretty soon children will die again , because that &apos;s just one question of the numbers .
in the rich world , the millions of us have threatened from only one generation yet , hardly .
here &apos;s a very fundamental service . is there at home , so you can read the homework ?
the greeks called these divinity of creativity in the creativity of creativity .
and i find it dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see how it &apos;s taken to the next century .
this is a evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s running in the microseal area .
so in other words , the future is a year around a year since i was on this world .
they shoot the decision -- they shoot them , even if they &apos;re interested in their own best interest .
so doing things -- you know , people remind -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it , you &apos;re going to appreciate it .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said they were doing this model .
a method that is particularly interesting , and which i used in the last time is evolution itself .
we had a team of rock lows last year in boston for the code for programming .
so , imagine if you were at the same time at several places , how would that feel ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
so the neurons are the information processing workers that have built these cell communities .
so , it was possible for us to bring the small digital springs with the torture of torture .
echoacezua , a little antioxidancy that helps you go to the league .
no , the gap i &apos;m talking about is what i &apos;m talking about to do with this is to disappoint yourself .
when professors become curiously curious , they will often shrink in a lot of research on the top .
this is what happens to the machine age , and it &apos;s the book that happens , and it &apos;s the olith gray gray .
and it &apos;s about creating a playful , creative , creative way of solving a problem .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first greenhouse with fuel generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
it turns out it actually meant to be meaningful , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do anything with your movie . &quot;
in the moment , it was like a film director had a warning shift .
that &apos;s how if i would say , shack your child , it just three times more than five times .
and the main lesson that we , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
but there &apos;s no promise that we can look around , where you learn how to make fire .
it &apos;s going to be writing the piece , will always be more and more and more to my personal , to play it .
but this concepts of cyberage that bring us back back to our capabilities again .
so these nauds tend to survive longer and they multiply in size .
so that &apos;s how simple words that we also use in the language of political correctly .
the first example is , what many of you know , and some of you estimate , very few of you don &apos;t need at all .
instead , they go to the doctor , and the doctor says to them : we could do a or we could make b .
i want to explain to you with this mechanism today , or something , which is unfamiliar to you .
so now i &apos;m one of my favorite images , tweet workers from the tank .
but now here &apos;s where you have to get evidence of this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
for example , in openness , for example , we &apos;re at the garbage 20 percent of the trash between wind .
but again and again , very rare , something special happened . one of the representatives was actually overwhelmed in the world .
my heart raw , i was scrambling , while i was trying to imagine what was going on .
the human part of this book , far from the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in .
immediately , they &apos;re going to be able to experience them , for those of you who are predictable , they can &apos;t experience that .
they reformed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that will have changed a lot of biology .
and because you &apos;re obsessed with your mind . how can you feel hardly ?
for those non-engineers , little-shaped material became another material , electronics was just another material .
so what can three billion growing up , healthy , productive , productive members of the community bring us ?
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is indish , but it &apos;s also very timed .
and every time it divided , it has been distributed to distribute chemicals in the same quantities .
so i would say there are three simple rules to follow a realistic result .
so i wanted to create something else , something where the process starts when the error is shaped .
and when you take a picture of a camera , the process ends up when you put it on the outside .
but my interest in photography , when i got my first digital camera , at age 15 .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break into 20 pieces , like you know it from documentations .
i spent a lot of time in my life trying to be myself , and to adapt me at the same time .
but not just that -- that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , and they connect with the universe and other devices out there .
three billion hours per week are not nearly enough to solve the most important problems of the world .
there &apos;s something like this , like this whole variable plants that are changing plants on the beckers .
if anyone who would have built an 2.5-instructional construction , he would have been wearing the price for home .
i met mr in 2008 , two years ago , in walt disney hall .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far you can take a bit away from the future .
every year we &apos;re going to lose three million tons of phosphorus that really have to go back into circles .
the result is that i don &apos;t know where i &apos;m going to be treated when i was going to go down the gang .
they can go out and create their own museum -- from all these pictures , they can put their own collection .
so , in the large and all of us , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have what the goal is .
well , a lightning is usually something that you find because you &apos;ve left it somewhere .
so the idea is that we actually put people together in the way they do things together , collective .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the professional development department of a nonprofit organization called rorobin .
it &apos;s about being happy or pleased to be the person if this person thinks about their lives .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
they lie , they flip around , they &apos;re confused and they &apos;re really drought .
because the ground is going to die the mosses , and the wind and the water is washing off the ground .
so you &apos;re just going to be able to put citizens into the situation , sit down with these kinds of scientific technologies .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you see .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve seen with the so-called gigapian technology .
well , the film in the sundance film festival , we can look at this .
and every time i interviewed somebody , i can say , &quot; are you happy enough for this interview ?
pollinators are born as the calf of a glacier or they break out of pollinators .
so in this project , we actually designed some little marker to track the waste as it goes through the system .
our language has been restored the social changes that have been solved in many cases by a technological change .
but danny , in the entire american pursuit , is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
i know we can do it , and as far as it is something that the world needs now .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccine for the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , much , but let &apos;s see how different teams act .
and , even though it seems really easy , it &apos;s really hard because people are working very fast .
there are very , very few things that you can say at all , there &apos;s a chance in a million .
and i noticed how these very profound souls , a space mission like this .
that was the movement . it was the law . it was the business plan of the american agriculture .
when i come , with my little v pioneer and i just sit down , this feeling comes up .
there &apos;s a silly african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
we made little pieces , we made a error correction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
they found a article with false thought , they could feel the copyright idea of this thought .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the flow of how nobody could have predicted .
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , oma . i promise it . &quot;
i &apos;ve been trying to make it clear , like valuable cities , to be as much valuable as they are as they are .
and it seemed to have something like this , with these gray boxes , this real-time system .
and you &apos;re going to give you all the nutrients that you might just wish without any effort to offer .
if a mind has a sense of these qualties , we can create a new reality and create new forms .
maybe that &apos;s the sense of wishes , a perception of the iconic , a sense of our own power .
the challenge provides a common experience , a common language , basic posture to build the right prototype .
if you have 10 teams that go typical , you get about six , you get the stable structures .
and there &apos;s certainly unclear about how bad these are going to follow , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
if we can do this , that &apos;s going to be this bicycle of data , maybe a new source of information .
this is really important because this is a realization that is not in a single wider pedian .
in holland , you understand this , of course , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .

and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first place for all the information is a part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i got most of the feedback , or where i had the biggest success , are the ones where i interact with things .
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend a lot of time thinking about the stuff , because , if you imagine all the time , you won &apos;t listen to me .
you have to separate two things : to be a medical fact , to be a medical fact , amputated , and to the other social opinions about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
the basic idea of this company was , the analogy phase , with optical printing , and starting to start with digital production .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the treasure -- you don &apos;t have to get the data on a usb -- you &apos;re not going to be able to be able to see how we &apos;ve seen it .
and in this way , the critical variable is actually the critical variable that a memory of self has been different from a living self . very little influence on this story .
and it works in a medical culture that recognizes people to fill the system with life , and if that &apos;s what they do , people also make mistakes from time .
and it will allow people to measure home from their blood pressure to send him to their doctor , and for example , to share it with others , to something more than 100 dollars .
so the first case : all the religions of atoms from the metal are still on the metal , and at the same time , they move the same atomic atoms and down .
when i think about creating overflow , i don &apos;t mean life full of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of possibilities .
but the latest dna evidence shows that the etrushing , which later did the rome of the tube , the same dna as the old lyrics .
how to make happiness is very different about how they think and whether they think of memory , or whether they think of life itself .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a mammals -- they dig it without the whole complex .
we &apos;re going to turn it on , and expect to collect data in june or juli , and put our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
we want to encourage the world of creation , the inventors , the contribution of compassion , because this world that we live in , this interactive world .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there is no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
so one day i decided to visit the filiter , and i asked the head , &quot; this model works that people really offer all of these possibilities ? &quot;
the head of congress came up and said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but we might look at the tedtalk .
we need to have these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the time and go to the future , we will be glad to have done .
so i stood back with a little team on unknown terrain , and we drew &quot; avatar , &quot; with a new technique that didn &apos;t exist before .
and then we don &apos;t do that , but that &apos;s partly , i think , you know , it &apos;s pretty well done , people are quite convinced .
i mean , it can make strange to think that there &apos;s a thing at the same time in two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they evolved .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; -- to bring a &quot; ta-da &quot; moment .
but the measurements were quite beautiful . and people in my company said that we were not able to be able to be able to do that .
i used to be seventh 10 when i went back to a curse of his courses and played the last of the four balconies of chopin , a late piece .
if your job was confined , you didn &apos;t look at everything for you . everybody knew you had this physical genius that helped you have helped you .
in nine people that we have committed , one that we have been dedicated for innocent , which was dedicated from death and from the death cell .
so , an organism could learn , for example , a certain fruit didn &apos;t eat certain fruit , because it was bad , and it made it sick , the last time he eaten it .
personally , i find it &apos;s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to go to compromise with the ideas in your head .
it &apos;s about creating people in interactive media , so that they can use these interactive media , so that they can create a peaceful experience .
finally , this older black man came up with a very concerned face in the courthouse hall and sat right behind me , almost on the defense bank .
there &apos;s this plane that &apos;s made out of hundreds of thousands of pieces that work together to make their safer flight . does it not make you visible ? &quot;
one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in , &quot; thylacine in my trash . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults , met me , was relaxed in a box and was put in my hands .
we &apos;re going to have a process where the rule might be asked 100,000 years , and we can combine it on a thousand years -- and maybe even on the next 100 years .
there &apos;s a series of people who have a lot more &quot; uh , &quot; oh , moments than others , and under the worst ones , are frowning .
that means we &apos;re just seeing our views before we see it , we &apos;re going to bring it back to our soul in the back , to say , okay .
his job is to create conditions that exist less than a billionth of the universe at the beginning of the universe -- and to 600 million times within a second .
but they also preserve a secret for our future , a future where we have to adapt to more and more challenges , through greater creativity and printing systems .
and a lot of discussions that i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had over the last three years to photovoltaics .
a saesman who , if you do the full of the power of water , has enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s four to four to six .
and something interesting happened to me , because of jacques cousteal coupled , the thought was a completely unknown world here on our planet .
and our european network is basically only made out of laurotating maintenance maintenance of big power , where the wave is all around europe .
a process that -- as everybody knows who &apos;s ever tried to do something -- in other words , everyone here -- is not always reasonably reasonable .
and every year , we asked students to create products and services and services that can live within a decade of mild &apos;s lives of humans .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pension of the universe is far beyond the universe , but it &apos;s about justice .
and finally , saturday : a unique , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world without saying a word .
they didn &apos;t count , because he was connected with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had to do .
i think the molecular biology in general now , so generally , i &apos;m talking about biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
how about the oppression , wherever you are , to give a voice to make your attention and create change , for the first time ?
i love finding each opportunity to find a different colorful , crazy outfit , wear , and to photograph in the last time and blogging .
i used to tell my wife , whenever a human being is in a moral judgment , because we should try to replace it through the dictionaries .
and it turns out that if you make it , something concrete feels , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people to save more .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people that we love to preserve despair from sales , but they also prepare to prepare good with it .
so we take something very complicated , turn it into sound , a sequence of sound , and we produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re constantly involved in doing the danger , the other ones , if you just put fire .
now , in egypt , the labs in april 2011 , the headquarters of the egyptian police , and they found a lot of actors .
and after about a year of planning , two weeks of programming work , zero-sumness and refueling , tony made the first time after seven years .
so , this is what this reactors was a problem that we fill in our fill , and so that &apos;s reduced the waste dramatically by this process .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve now digitized biology and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new phase of biology by building new life and building .
but that keeps me at night -- one of the things that kept me at night . we &apos;ve never really needed scientific progress as much as we &apos;ve never been .
according to burrburden , the premier in january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls from this film .
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate right now , from the coal force , because we don &apos;t have any , or stores , because it &apos;s not going to go .
a lot of our friends thought that we &apos;re beautiful to do this , and that we &apos;re all back and all the pictures of the walls would be the graffiti .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst errors only happened in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues claim , but is a total nonsense .
but these apps are like little digital memories , that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers of government who pay control and recommend .
when i was a student at stanford university at stanford university , i went to this very , very exclusive food center , at least at the time , he was really exclusive .
in a country that has just been behind the crisis , the congress has been elected in congress for this broader change with 124 to a voice .
it seems like we were right from the other parts of life , but in fact , the biggest part , the fundamental mechanisms are our cells pretty much .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this as if the first sentence of preferences had to be wrong , as if you had to adopt the opposite without proof evidence .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , when i have the experience that i have , the piece that i &apos;ve been working on for a long time to experience how to experience .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up to my talk , and he said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing , you &apos;re talking like this . &quot;
well , there are plenty of marks and eighteen marks , these things that come and go , but one playing was eight , marke marke is a pretty strong thing .
and if you &apos;ve already got that the drugs of risk and high-tech , let me tell you , the data is a science for yourself .
if i tell you that somebody &apos;s life as eight on a scale of 10 has given them a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self .
now , i was using a couple of people in the company , and nobody could give me an extraordinary answer , until i finally got to the tennis biologists .
basically , you get every round of dogs at least random at random and while you &apos;re trying to form words , you &apos;re going to see words about a dictionary .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel a little bit more comfortable or maybe a little bit less likely to talk to you about it .
but then another thing happened , very interesting step , where things were completely different , because these cells started to communicate and exchange information so that communities came from cells .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference is what we say in climate .
they start out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all they see is fluid channels and these dense pockets .
we now , from our discoveries around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to make us the big challenges of our planet .
so a app that &apos;s written in a couple of days , and then it &apos;s spread from rare , is a kind of like bullshell on the institution of the government .
what that means is that if you would meet someone , and you would tell them , oh , his father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about their size ?
at this point , and if you laugh , you realize how important that gap is , and how much time you need to experience something to experience what artists can tell us very well .
as it would feel like to live in a world where the german state of people , especially when there were lots of jews of juvenile .
and because the government is ultimately drawn out of our power -- remembering you , &quot; we &apos;re thinking the people ? &quot; -- how do we think about it , how this change happens .
are they paralyzed , stable , family , affordable , safe , sacred , holy , and how the dalai lama or yoda ?
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard , the most powerful act of psychotic parallel from the repertoire .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with sexual human beings , whose gender atypical -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male male or female guys .
that &apos;s what we had to do at the time . if we took kids a book , we took the description of the exchange and proposed them into the canvas in our heads .
we came up with music . and a few days later , i got an email where nathaniel was interested in my own class .
and since we &apos;re going to give up the median media campus , for example , the virtual reality in our v.r.r. lab , we can actually do this all the time .
i was talking to him : why do you do , you know , and i both know if this book is not a brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my blame , right ?
because it makes a lot of sense like everything else i &apos;ve heard about when it was about to explain the absolutely crazy vision of the creative process .
so it &apos;s so far . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there at the time , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever made -- 27 kilometers in diameter .
and i argued that we may be able to create a new form of chambers in which there could be massive new species based on this digital design .
the reason that it was better than everything was worse than everything was worse than everything was worse , it was possible for people to do experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
and i negotiated with me that if i doubled my efforts to perfect harbor , i could never make a mistake that the voice could decrease .
so these are just some of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but they could have been the last six days or the last six years .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i had several months to plan them to find the different places for the pieces of the site .
but also , because it turns out that we &apos;re using this whole time to actually change what we &apos;re able to do as people who are able to do .
i can now tell the sound that the bach had , on the modern wings to sound what a barockaroo can &apos;t be balano .
already , from german german to english , can challenge more knowledge , once you think about it when you go to diarrhea or about poetry .
bg : now we need one of these scalable , electricity , generated things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to use .
if you &apos;re also playing , you see some nuances here that are looking up to the eyes , and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows are surprising .
you have to imagine that if you &apos;re going to do something of the classic guns , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software just one hour .
i &apos;m a wall . i have to work to be able to stand up every day at the same time and sweat me and really unpleasant .
so they found out loud herottous , the rocket game and agreed a national strategy . one day you would eat . the next day you would play .
the other note says whether we use the zero-sum emissions , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
the studio i sold this as a &quot; romeo and julia on a ship , &quot; it became a film episode , a passionate film .
so far , in discussions are always trying to do this insulin , and they &apos;re doing targets that have a little bit of their own web that has to do with our verbal and nothing .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build in berlin in berlin , in which we can sort of build the electric power of the island at the scale of three .
that is , the interpret has to interpret this unbelievable fear of the emergency language in a different , the audible , concrete , non-verbal music language .
the intuitive user is not only since apple &apos;s fundamental factor , elementary factor , elementary success factor , when i just want to use technological devices to people .
a lot of journalists called me on the question : &quot; what test are you going to do , whether caster sexiya or male ? &quot;
now , what i hear is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing that &apos;s wrong .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them to play together some kind of game , to control their health .
and imagine , i &apos;ve even been a five-year-old child with dr. p. and so , this practice is trying to stop , natural success without success .
bg : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say we should spend the u.s. 10 billion a year more than you &apos;re doing today -- this is not so dramatic .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us work and interact , and the unexpected linear that we are , the real nutrition of creativity .
and since there was no video games or this overwhelmed with computer filming , the whole language of media in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
so , as you knew in the village , who had what happened with winners and when , this is what happens to happen to these extension of our self through these cellular devices on global level .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take your responsibility so that i was so helpful , and so i would be able to make my patients without having to contact him .
i got a straightforward box , because i &apos;m not on the bike , but often there &apos;s disabled disability to the bike .
and so i look at one of the people , in common with most of the experimental quantum physicists that need a good logic to put together the complex ideas together .
if we look at one of the founder of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream &quot; a kind of solution .
jacques cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating sensations that showed us animals and places and a world of wonder that we could never imagine before .
and if we can do it , of course , for adian , for nike , for nike and mauritz and the whole textile industry .
in every step , we produced these pieces in the overseas so that we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process of what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
unlike the title of the 20th century , the participation of the community is to become the part of this phenomenon -- either by making it or make something new .
my wife , my kids , and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and dedicated theoretical theories and archives have taken our house .
we can go out a step further , and then review the data , and see that circles are diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
90 percent of the big fish we love , the tuna , the tuna , the length , the lakes , the lakes , heavy fish , they &apos;re broken together .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has doubled more than doubling , which has tripled in the average income of the world population .
one of the areas that we see in both of our culture today , in the united states today , are the fighting about the beginning of life and the end of life .
well , this is good , you know , paul is walking around and talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are , and that people should just stop jamming .
the second feature is a proof of experience and memory : basically it &apos;s between his life and happy to be happy about his life or happy with his life .
you go to this capsule , you sweden into these dark , the enemy environment , where there &apos;s no hope on rescue if you don &apos;t make it back .
so , there &apos;s also a change there , because there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only from that waste , yes , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable renewables .
it was exposed in the cell , and it realized the other chromosome as a stranger , and so we had only one cell with a new chromosome .
and these scientists just documented the different themes with these ceo , and how much time they make them make decisions that are related to the themes .
everybody thinks i was between titanic and avatar , and i was going to be able to stand up , and i would have celebrated the nights on a handle on the beach .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and you should also do that , because that love story , like romantic , is always a final thing .
my first memories are from this boat -- the steak of the engine , the sound of a wave on the bug , the threshold and the horizon .
and if you manipulate the speed of this pink , you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor , and eventually , the centrifuge explode .
it &apos;s the living self , the doctor &apos;s doctor -- you know , if the doctor says , &quot; do it go now if i put them in here ? &quot;
now , when we go forward and look for age , we say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are even the main thing about people who need to worry about .
we should call them what it is , a commercial paper , a commercial , quickly , risk the ecological capital that makes this production .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use storage co2 that could just be brought to producers , converting co2 into fuel to drive this process .
so when i started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
if people would take this seriously seriously , i mean , it seems to be all on your head , everything we believe , for example , in tax policy and so on .
it depends on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two columns , and that &apos;s what the opposite of the first sentence would be proven and predicted .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the creator and the design -- which we actually founded the company -- were too slow to start .
it looks like this , who has no willingness , can &apos;t be moved for his actions and the main responsibility to become responsibility , and therefore he &apos;s unsustainable .
since i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and that &apos;s why my palette of music is still much more colorful , emotions and emotions have today .
they are also in a artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , electronics , combined , and combined it in quite a bicycle .
and i learned that the world of deep sea , even in the flat ocean oceans , is so fascinating about the fascinating life that we can &apos;t really imagine .
and then the scope of the semantic bonds and the filters that come out of it , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic network effect .
i recently made a question with 25,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that have been a typical americans on a day of 70 .
a few weeks later , the firefighters got a letter of the household ownership in which they use for the tapestry of their households .
the food , which has been dedicated by a chef or a chef full of cooking , has to be eaten and not only distorted or receptions .
they should be talking about these innovation strategy , and they would be smiled by the ridiculous ones that are spent on these innovations .
and if you want to go over 20 , three-percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to switch off the el .
and then we chose a v.d burning burn and burning the laser , and then we tried to focus on these camera .
of course , the chance of randomly elected instructions is very small that they &apos;re going to have to have a case , so they &apos;re not going to do the instructions of instructions .
that means , instead of remembering individually , we have standardized , common , in mapping patterns of memories that we can hang our personal memories .
and yet the burning of coal , one of the main reasons for global warming is remarkable , the remarkable clean coal technology that you see here , everything .
that &apos;s why i sent them home , i was trying to tell me a voice that was trying to tell me , &quot; goldman , don &apos;t do good idea . that &apos;s not . &quot;
what do you think about the average performance for a cardiologist or a nurse or a orthopian , a birthday , should be a rescue assistance ?
this is a people who doesn &apos;t distinguish cognitive colors between the blue and green , because the hiding scene is dependent on the forest that people depend on , equally .
and my love to science fiction appeared in my environment , because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea .
we see a lot , many gigabytes of digital photos here that you &apos;re going to get on and continue while , turning around , can be new in any way .
this tribe , the cofan , have 17 variants on ayahuhuaca , which you all recognize at great distance in the forest that appear for our eyes as a kind of view .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept that was the idea of advertising , your product as much as possible as possible as many people can see as possible .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is that you have in front of each other , because you have a task forests that you can explain to another .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are too disturbing the distant of the earth , that they &apos;re not even away at all .
that our system also has a price climb , because we &apos;re still doing 20 percent with the el , and we &apos;re also making a price on the other things .
we &apos;ve only spent two years of phosphorus , and we &apos;re now being used by the phosphorus mining worldwide , much more uranium in the environment than in all atoms .
we propose that 10 years of recognition , in 10 years , the ambition of the civil rights is going to be as high as the presentation of the legacy of the law .
and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s grown up with the internet , and the idea that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to just build the systems right .
and so far the isolation goes as a species planet , it will be isolated and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science . but i &apos;m thinking you &apos;re certainly going to have to have a director , a leader , a leader like a ship of skatekeepers or so .
and after a very short period of time , it had lost all the characteristics of species and convert in a completely new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
well , i hope you &apos;ll agree that the players are human resources that we can use in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
now , all of these randomly elected instructions , leading all of the programs , and the charges that are the ones that i would like to say . &quot;
these are two very different units , the life itself , and the memory itself , and the two is part of the change differently from happiness .
if this device sequences , or dna virus that &apos;s not known , it &apos;s called the health authority and obstacle a pandemic of your breakdown .
now , if you bought it , people would buy six times a glass of marker , who they had six choices when they had 24 choices .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at one point when there was a break , octavio said , &quot; paul , &quot; we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
but for two weeks , we have programmed , we went to the road proposal in venice , my children were raised , my dog , and we also created this .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the old greek historic historic historic , you may know this story . the story of how and why games were invented .
but i think , in this frame , and with an intention , to make something real , i &apos;m just going to leave the needle in there and go from the stage .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try and look at things , whether it works , it doesn &apos;t change when it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
a lot of arguments about it . fisheries make the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take on tuna . a big part .
and because they &apos;re working much harder than we &apos;re working , and because they &apos;re only three to six months , they &apos;re talking in their weight , in energy consumption , something triggered about three billion people .
so if you take the system like i was taught , and all of you have been disgusted health care , then at the end , nobody else is left .
i think the remarkable thing about the last few years is that we &apos;ve changed from a physical world to a digital world .
so gender is really complicated ; internal sexuality is not just in the middle of gender -- in some ways , you can be distributed across the bandwidth .
and by the way , we migrate and sphere , and we mix so much that they can &apos;t tell longer that isolation is necessary for evolution to find statements .
of course , the stories that i was looking for , from the scienzational capital , &quot; terminator , &quot; aliens , &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case , the sperm is a chomosom that hits the chromosome cell .
not only from darwinian &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive the ability of people and survive , from the struggle of the human mind is determined by conflicts .
and i went to the middle of the eighty years after berlin because i wanted to make renewable energy , and that wasn &apos;t going to be in karslsler .
they believed that creativity was a kind of divine mind that comes from a distance , unknown source of people -- from unexplained , unknown reasons .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing set for prescription drugs for people like you and me , if you think about it , no sense at all , because we don &apos;t buy it .
armstrong twitter was about us , and then in december , the time-magazine taught us when one of the best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , as designers , as designers , we always think about how people use things that we design .
they were the idea that people who had political power , these political power should have , because of the abandoned blood line from the grandfather to the grandfather and so on .
i &apos;ve got some people to count the number of books that were published in the last five years in the last five years , and they spent about 40 , and there were much more .
she came from a man , a african-american , sympathy , rau , homeless , who was playing on a spige that had only two more saides .
and i went back through the same torture of shame and self-doubt , and i was feeling frozen , and i went back to work until it came back and again .
it &apos;s hard to talk about rains , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not welcome to the process of truth and reconciliation .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections around them around them , literally , who they are , and that &apos;s the profound and strange mechanics of quantum mechanics .
drunk optimism is the desire to do something immediately , a roadside star that we believe that we have a profound hope on success .
well , very briefly , another reason that we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t care about the same things when we think about life , and in fact , if we live .
suppose you &apos;ve got a blind darkness and you &apos;re going to be transmitted to a surgery that &apos;s an average 400 performance in terms of blindness .
it doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re probably going to go home four hours , but you &apos;re going to get your employer or any of you , you know , like you &apos;re working with the four hours .

i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been working for a few years now with biohacking , and that &apos;s what i started to do , because i just wanted to know what i wanted to do in front of the university of theoretical theoretical .
and i left the medical study with the impression that i knew if i knew everything and knew everything , or as much as much as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible , that i &apos;m going to do that by error .
and then , if i move another step further into these interior interactions , where i agree with each voice , in language , by language , and they don &apos;t have to tax more and more cursor the curves , i &apos;m even faster , and then i &apos;m even more immediate .
that is , i &apos;ve actually beaten you down now that you don &apos;t recognize any more patterns in the middle , but i &apos;ve been able to see it within a long period of time , again in this dog , to see this picture .

because what it turns out is that if you offer a placebo in a white pill , in the form of an ascent tablet , it &apos;s just a round ball , white mushrooms that has a certain measurement .
the coal evolution is the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid decline in the deadline , and therefore we have refrigerators , climate materials , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
we took the light out , we put it in a vacuum , and we cleaned the whole air , and we put it out of the air up to almost all the way around , in the entire way that metal was free , and it always wanted to act .

and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a foreign , a newsling , new , in the picture -- and not just okay , but something that you need to be grateful , maybe a gift of the boat .
and so i think of the city a very different view , a very different impression , which is that i see negative and positive zones of a city , and so on this kind of way , a very different virtual , virtual map of a very real city .

and that &apos;s very amazing , because you actually believe that this high-tech technology , which is that you actually bring one into the future , but it &apos;s so that the future is right at us , in our archational roots .
and because i was born without waking legs , and my feet would have been disgusted , and i just had some toes on this one and a few toes on the other hand , he had to translate that stranger , this strangers had to translate the bad news .

when we &apos;re in a game world , i think that many of us turn into our best version , every time we &apos;re willing to help innovate the hard problem to solve the problem as long as we &apos;re trying to eradicate again .
and there &apos;s only one of these little devices , because things should always be more intuitive , more and more natural , friendly , and you have to look at what &apos;s really for us , of course , what &apos;s used to people , what &apos;s friendly or intuitive .

so , the problem of cooperative online worlds such as world warcraft , is that it &apos;s so satisfying , at the time , at the ranging of an episode , that we should spend our whole time in these worlds .
later on day , i went to this basic piece with miguel , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be , &quot; of course , as any farm that i &apos;ve ever been on , &quot; how do you solve ? &quot;
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice caps , which had reached for three million years the size of the lower 48 states , which is 40 percent decreased .

and we started to create pieces , starting with the five to seventh letters , and then we put them together , and we put them up to add up to 24,000 letters to put them back together to 27,000 .
it empowered us to tell the story of neuromarketing , as we tell the story of this film in this film , that you use mris mri to make the lustal centers of the brain , both advertising and advertising movies .

suppose they live in a certain remote area , and they have a locked people with cardiac heart attacks , and their doctor &apos;s physicians overwhelmed this cardiac , whose average performance is at 200 .
but when i was working with him , and asked him why he did this intervention -- it was risking operations -- his answer was that in his country , these kids would be very bad , and so he had to do it .
and , of course , when it &apos;s also a little intuitive , and how can i take it up as an age of age and create things that make it so that they use a used to use a friendship , so they &apos;re intuitive because then they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re easy to use .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positive positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do . those of you who have the sleeping limits and without the limitations , with bad outcomes and the good results .
they also have three big problems . the cost , especially in highly regulated countries , and the question is that you really feel that nothing can &apos;t go wrong , despite the human work that the fuel is not used for weapons .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid of a real gas , and it keeps millions of people from blows .
now , to decide not buy a glass of marker is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our quiet -- but it turns out that the decision-making problem systems also affect us very powerful decisions .
i don &apos;t have to do that emotionally , because the corner will always be a crazy , colorful , colorful , colorful output that would just wait for me if i love a little bit in the heart and see it .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we &apos;re going to make less peace with the result of the election as if we had the opportunity between less possibilities .
here &apos;s a photograph that i took on the north of the bathba islands when i went to the whale of the whilst jagd , and this man , aolya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .

i met these people of gratul , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to propose a light on every single surface , and then draw with a laser pointer pointment on the surface of the negative .
so what that means is , if we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place of people in evolution , and especially as we look into the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
so there &apos;s great challenges here . there &apos;s challenges in transmission , for example , if we say the energy outside the country is , they don &apos;t just need the technology , they also need to deal with the risk that the energy comes from anywhere else .
but , as we think , the only way we think of biology is to have a big impact without any anticipation of food , or the limitations of their availability is available when we see co2 as an co2 material , and so we &apos;re working on these cells .

now the fascinating thing is that the betakoline , which is in the liane , mao-inhibitors are right from the kind of way that &apos;s necessary to ask the tryptaminine potentially . so they ask themselves .

what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack was actually , it was slow and unleashed -- obviously in trying to make engineers desperately desperate , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get out at that very quickly .
so maybe the technology of this technological change is clear , because the more that there was always a different truth , which is that every human being can give something very special and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt to our plus is our plus .
my good friend ray short because we &apos;ve shown that every tool that will become the information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , makes it a big jump , and the pride of performance will doubt every 12 to 24 months .

i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i found something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in single living organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is led into two dead cells .

he was talking in a very healing , and he was talking about yo-yo and hillary clinton and about how the dodgers would never create in the world &apos;s world , and that would be because of the most vital stats in the last year of beethoven fathers .
whenever we think of native landscape and landscape , we either complain and the old framework of nobel wild , which is a simplistic thought , or on the other side , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
i wanted to return to the routine , and the quest of life of an unknown anticipation -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who had been doing every day for 20 years by telling them the stories of their stories and their stories , and we &apos;re still sleeping in the same bed .
but we don &apos;t even know when we listen to somebody like this , because we know this kind of way for a long time . somehow , we have the perform of interactive light and collective acceptance that creativity and somehow , somehow , and that art -- at the end of the seal .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually used a new kind of network that was used in the world -- this is a mobile phone web -- and anonymous and anonymous information from that network that network , which is to be collected from the neumber to understand how the city works .
and then the renaissance came and changed everything , and we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual in the center of the universe -- all the mysteries and mysteries . and there &apos;s no more space for mycelial , the feature of the goodbye .
in our desire to protect the people who are at the heart of heart , and to tell them the hard truth about their medical decrease or even to make a proper quality of life that they need to be expected , we don &apos;t adapt the stone that somebody is actually disabled .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that the problem of decision-making equipment -- constraints -- they &apos;re going to make the fluid alternatives ; concrete concrete ; they &apos;re doing real categories ; they &apos;re better -- we can deal with more categories , less ways to prepare complexity .
because we have this self-deception , this feeling of being great , dedicated by the highest creatures , not from such a kind of receptile , something like a organism that exists to an organism , and what else is unsustainable for us .
and that &apos;s when you &apos;re all feeling about politics , and the snake of working and all the other things that we really excited about , government , in the words of tim , in the words of tim lo &apos;lly , &quot; which we can &apos;t do it alone . &quot;
this may seem to be a little bit abundant , so i &apos;ll repeat it , so that if we can solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , i think we need to try to be able to play online for at least 21 billion hours a week to play the next week .
and our goal was , we wanted to go to seventy-20 percent renewable renewable , and then here &apos;s the rest of this , the rest , the last 10 , the last 10 percent renewable renewables that will be very , very expensive , very expensive , and that &apos;s not going to work out of batteries .
but what &apos;s going to find is 17 marking partners who were willing to make control on those control , who wanted to do with someone who wanted to make business and play as well as i &apos;m going to tell us , and the eventually to tell us to tell stories that we wouldn &apos;t usually have -- the stories that would never support a commercial .
but in fact , you had been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never simulate any reasonable time , whether it would work , but since there &apos;s modern computer , you can simulate it , you can simulate it , and you can see that yes , with the right tangible approach , it looks like it looks like it &apos;s functional .
but the process and the hard climbing , which was surrounded by him , when he took the gene out of the gene , where he didn &apos;t take anything more noise , and he would come back where he would come back . he realized that it didn &apos;t have to be an interior thing .
so this trait event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called a biography , pray , pray , playy , meaning that , unlike all my previous books from whatever the world went out into the world and a big mega-level , international event .
a continent will always be left , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious faith in africa . of course , there was a voodoo and odoo is simply the remaining of these very profound religious thoughts , as the tragedy of slavery .
but in fact , we see it more and more and more that if you &apos;re willing to constraints , and the unimportant opportunities will become unsustainable , then there &apos;s a increase in the numbers , there will be the cost of money , and there &apos;s a improvement of decision .
and one day , he looked at me at one of my practices -- these practices were simply tired and greek -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re an army , you &apos;re a powerful , powerful , and you &apos;re going to be a young girl , one day , one of those fears .
and the wind and the sun and the sun came down and they came to the outcome , a very exciting outcome , that you have the conventional system , which is after 20 years of restraints of the middle of about five cents a five-cent kilowatt-hour , about four to four cents in four cents .
and the problem , the problem is not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can be just a paragraph of what things like simple , so a simple problem , a problem of trying to throw a question , and how to do that or how to do that .
feet of food crops on planners , harmless food production on monocular cultures , chemicals on earth , fish , and the whole time the agricultural industry just said , &quot; if we feed more people , how bad can that be ? &quot;
not through the latest batteries and traders , but through fruit land , not through pumps , but through pump water , but through frozen water , not by chains , but through forests , but by the forests , and not by fishermen , but by fish , but by the sea .
so this is a more artistic direction , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and philosophers to work with scientists to deal with these technologies , and to ask them creative questions , and to work the creative museum , there &apos;s a museum , and there &apos;s all kinds of things .
so , you add up to the stolen co2 that leads to temperatures , and this temperature has increased some very negative consequences . and maybe even worse , the indication of indication , that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to these ecosystems and together .
nickles are things that are verified , like the prince , printed by prince , abandoned , deadly , and loved ones like flynynynn and agile and interacting , professionally , magically , magically , magically and mythologically .
it wasn &apos;t fast enough at others ; it wasn &apos;t fast enough . it ran and ran and ran , but it didn &apos;t get the house and the poem through them , and it passes it through it , and she said it was going to move it on land , and as she said -- she said -- after a more poet for others .
maybe this one might be a modern contribution , and if you &apos;re better than i expect it , that &apos;s great , but my core statement here is that we have to work on all five , and we can &apos;t give them any one of them , because you know , they all have significant problems .
and where you can see how far we are , what we really wanted to do and how sad we are , and how sad we are , that we can be on the earth , you can see that , for example , there &apos;s an open program , until you want to be a four-20-minute client here , yes ?
in my talk about 20 years of medical consciousness and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study of medical errors and wrong treatments to create all the possible for my first article that i wrote for the toronto my toronto star show , &quot; coat , black art , &quot; to learn , to learn .
so , with the total transparency of transparency , what the new thinking is , what &apos;s going on on on the old bang , yes , not that in the laser horse , and no longer cattle or anything else , or other phenomena , which is what i want to do right now , and that &apos;s what we want to do .
now , not exactly what i was hoping to me , but i went up -- the treasure , the treasure , the airline , the real firemen , the real firemen that were already done at that point that time , which were quite finished in the room to get a pair of shoes .
i had to get a single practice of seemingly often with these distances , elastic change -- in different colors -- you know , to build my leg muscles . and i hated these bars more than i hate them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
but we wanted to go a lot further . we wanted to build a total bacterial chromosome . it has more than 50,000 letters code code code , so we thought we could build it in the size of the virus that we could understand the size of the size of the protein to understand what the individual components are .
and out of a conversation today with dean kaman , one of the innovators of the do , i want to share with you a little bit -- he gave me the permission -- his technical marriage , which is called &quot; the slingle , &quot; and perhaps many of you may have heard . it &apos;s got the size of a refrigerator in the village .
&quot; cloud-like &quot; cloud , &quot; something that my friends call &quot; autodesk tonight , &quot; sensors , sensors and robots , 3d models , 3d printer , which allow us to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic , synthetic fuel , vaccine , digital vaccine , technological materials , medicine and artificial intelligence .
look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo acids in a trans-state state , the light bulbs without burning , an amazing accurrency of the mind of the mind so that it holds that if it &apos;s transformed an extreme state of extreme state .
this was the most surgical form of a déid vivi ever experienced , because before i knew about a corner , i knew what was going on in the elevator of the elevator of the monkey , because i was going to go through a movie film , when we turned the movie .
in this picture , i &apos;ve taken a bus as a center of despair in all directions , because if you look at the smoke of life , all existed specials on the two branches of these evolutionary concepts , they &apos;ve been survived in evolutionary terms : they &apos;ve survived ; it &apos;s been demonstrating their environment and demonstrated .
and so , with this premise with this premise with this premise , for example , brian default in england , has tried to put a minimum of minimum , then a steam coordination cooperative cooperative , a heck , and so on , and so forth , and it &apos;s grown up , so that bacteria can grow bacteria .
and then , from the do-it-it-item , the founder of the green website , and i said , &quot; o.k , we need to hit us now , even real , and then have two stalins , and then two sizes in london , a thousand , 10 , and a second one in the u.s. , in san francisco , in san francisco . &quot;
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to get zero , and that &apos;s dependent on the number of people , depending on the amount of people who are using the average , every average person in average , for average energy , for every service of energy , and energy , which will be emitted per unit per unit .
and the realization of president lobo was that the wisdom of the argument that i thought about was a way to get the foreign investors to come and build this city and build this city to be meaningful for all the parties in honoras , which has been afraid for many years of fear and fear .
i had to read this list of a friend loud , and i had to laugh , but it was so ridiculous , but i could only come to the court , and i couldn &apos;t talk more , and i had to stop reading , and i &apos;d have to collect it for a minute to collect this extraterrestrial and to the emotional worker .
and a group of ankara , which i &apos;ve been learning about a while ago , which is a student group that wanted to communicate more of the public , which they wanted to learn to learn what they learned in the u.n. , and they &apos;ve done so on the street , and trying to explain people what n.a n.a is .
there are 175 dresses in my supermarket when they don &apos;t count the 10 different olive seasons and 12 balances that they could buy to create a large number of salsat descends in the unlikely case that the 17th century they &apos;re not in the store for them .
and that was really , really , really , really , very bitter , and then you go into this phase , and you get it into a picture of a picture where i asked myself 10 years after , you know , a thousand years ago , you know , there was a basic ubiquitous , and , of course , there &apos;s a great deal in the collective collection , of course , whether that &apos;s going to be so great .
first of all , i &apos;m going to show you , as quickly as quickly as possible , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we have as a piece of microsoft as an exception in front of a year ago , which is seasion ragon . and it &apos;s an environment that you can either be able to deal with large amounts of visual data .
first of all , if you &apos;re going to be a kid as big as a baby , as a baby , is that you care about what you &apos;re doing so much ? and the more you &apos;re allowed to have your parents , whether your parents allowed them to play more or less poured , less to play , more , maybe even more curiously , your curiosity , of course .
i mean , most of the eyebrows of our lives -- and i &apos;ve done this -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds for about three seconds , which means that you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a month . there &apos;s about 600,000 . there are about half of them . most of you don &apos;t leave it .
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , all the big scientists , what we &apos;ve done is we need just 10 million . and even when we tested our materials in a russian reactor , to make sure that it &apos;s reasonable , you &apos;re just working in the 1000s .
it really works , that really works , that will be made in the academic condition , and we thought , o.k , which we might have done , then we &apos;ve taken a webcam , then we put a webcat on , which goes down , the lens off , then you have a microscope , a microscope , which is about hundreds of thousands of times .
so if i show you 600 time-time time-time tips and you put them into 10 categories or i show you 400 times , and these 20 categories , in 20 categories , then you believe that i have given them more choice and a better choice than i had given them 400 when i had given them to 600 .
friday , friday friday , friday friday , goodbon friday . let &apos;s make sure the victory , frightened . friday , friday . friday day day day . don &apos;t you know that we would have this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
i think i believe that a significant channel -- not the only one , but a significant creator to this explosion of depression , and even suicide , is that people have experienced disappointment because their standards are so high . and then , if they have to explain that experience themselves , they think it would be their own .
the neolithic revolution that brought us to agriculture , and at that moment , the cult of the saint signs , the poetry of the prohip through the propagation of the psa and the archaebie , and specialization -- only 10,000 years ago .
this is when you focus on a laser in the room , then you can catch small particles in the air or in the liquid , and then you can put them in the liquid , and then you move in this focus , so the one that &apos;s caught up there , so it &apos;s like a torque , like a torque in the baseline .
it would be great if we could bring this pattern of normal to another possibility of the possibility or the strength of the strength of the strength , even a little bit more dangerous , exchange , so we could put the forces of lots of many other kids , and invite them to bring their very special skills and valuable skills into society .
you know , when michelangelo shaped the mosque , it means he took the end of the hammer and he sat down on mof -- you can still see a little untapped spot under -- and he said , &quot; perchli paragon ? why don &apos;t you ? &quot;
but in 2011 , if you &apos;re going to buy a new color printer of the leading printing printing printing printing printing and print a page , then this helpful site on every page on any pattern , in a pattern that &apos;s clearly going to purchase the side , and then you &apos;re going to follow your printer and you &apos;re going to follow your printer .
so , my colleague at mit , with assigbif , you could still take a lot more about this , and the many other wonderful things that you can perceive with , but i &apos;d like to talk about the second part of the second part that we &apos;re talking about , and that &apos;s the concrete of our environment .
now , the problem -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us , the sympathy for the hard ones , they have as ordered as orinians and colorful , but they kind of look at the past , while the real world is continuing , our world is continuing .
and then i did this in my lab , i tried this to work in my lab , try to make a little bit of a difference , and then i bought a little bit of a handful cell phone , and i bought a little bit of a n.net analysis , which is trying to do an avatar , so , so , like , like , this , a m.m.
and if you were to choose another juggler , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species of self , and you have to think about how you decide this conflict , and that &apos;s really obvious , because if you think of the sense of time , and if you think about the answer . and if you think about the answer , you could get a different answer .
in the early 800s , i got a really amazing task when my professor at harvard asked me if i was interested in walking to haiti and filling the secret societies that were the foundation of duvalier &apos;s strength , and the clay coumarton was used to make it safe .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me about how i &apos;m going to deal with wishes , and i &apos;m going to show you something : this sentence has never adapted for me , and i &apos;m always saying very uncomfortable to answer people &apos;s questions and i think , and i think , why i understand why i understand why .
and if i translate this now , for example , in which i think , as a consideration , selected selection , as an injured choice , in which everybody comes up to me , i can look at it in the detail , and i &apos;m talking , you know , i can throw it down somewhere or buy it , or buy someone else .
i recommend to read all of you , stephen book , or look at the film , so that you &apos;re not just understanding the wonderful allies between those two men , but also how the music helped to make music , and how she was finally the instrument , when this game is able to get the game , the mid-up of the street from the street .
here in the picture , you &apos;re looking at the lab , in leadership , so there &apos;s a garage with anything like this , all kinds of labeled labeling , which has a group in paris , which is what has been successful , and it &apos;s pretty interesting , and i want to do a project for a moment .
no biologist for example , for example , would say that 50 percent or more of all kinds of species are going to die , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this is the apocalyptic aristotypse on the field of biological diversity -- hardly , what &apos;s known to us as the most optimistic arities in the field of the biodiversity .
bg : now we haven &apos;t put ourselves on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting openings for everything called &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there are big interest and people of the russia in russia , india , india , i &apos;ve been here -- and i &apos;ve been talking about the empowerment of energy , and how this is going to do this .
the computer visions have given these pictures together so that they &apos;re in the real room , in which these records , which were all made near the grassroots lake in the canadian rockies . they &apos;re talking about stabilized elements of stotas or pandemic imaging , and these things were all involved in each other .
and if you look at the software that we &apos;ve just seen on it , then you &apos;re going to understand why ninety nine-20 percent of our software today , or not quite intuitive , the ipad in lots of ipad , or in many ways , even though it &apos;s much more intuitive than classic software .
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients &quot; autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift from making the responsibility for making the decisions of somebody &apos;s decisions -- something that knows something -- the doctor -- to someone who knows nothing about it , and that &apos;s probably not the best way to make the best decision to make a patient -- the patient .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of desk , pray , pray , but i fell in one of those two things that we all fall in , when we &apos;re working on something , and it doesn &apos;t work . you start thinking that it &apos;s going to be a bad news . the most important book that &apos;s ever written .
we also have one of these same agents in the same size of the size , as he is in the half-le , in fact , the entire dynamic behavior of this web , so in the halfway , it looks like this halfway down there , there &apos;s the back here , there &apos;s the big battery that &apos;s all over here , so we &apos;re running around with the web that we simulate with .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical creature , which was believed that it was literally living in the walls of an artist &apos;s artist &apos;s studio -- like dobby , which is about the house cup -- the artist &apos;s sweet and the art of the art , and the art of the art of the art of the work , and the work would make it an invisible and the work .
now , if i want to give you one thing today , it &apos;s that the whole data of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of its parts and instead of thinking about information , i want you to think about how we can use information about how we use information , and we understand patterns , and so on , we &apos;re not going to see the most visible .
so we &apos;ve done in a study that i &apos;ve done with shlomo benzi and alessandro entero , we &apos;ve done a study with the people who were working on -- who worked for everybody -- and they were all in a collection of the collection in which they &apos;ve collected their hands for their hands .
interesting historical footprint : as mothering south spawning , they brought this use . the language changes over the centuries of allah lah lah lah lah , allah lah allah allah lava , they asoled it , they &apos;re still fighting with sticks and bugs .
now , today , you need , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this -- something like this -- which has the car in real time , has some sensors that made a thousand sensors that information out of the car , and then you &apos;re going to work on the system , and then you &apos;re going to use this car to make decisions back in real time and make things happen in real time .
i was afraid , not because i was afraid , but i was afraid that i could lose him that he could sink into one of his circumstances , and that i could destroy his relationship to the spirits if i started talking about sound and pedious and other exciting shapes and other exciting shapes of the dagogmatic spike .
so , in fact , the fact is that if you remember the 20th century , in 300 years , not for its wars or technical innovation , but rather than a era of a era that we were against , and we were the massive destruction of destruction and cultural and cultural diversity on earth , or passive problem . so that &apos;s not the change .
i had written this piece of avatar , which was the measurements in visual effects and computer generic effects in completely new cave , realizing the realities of human expressions that had been made by the middle cg . and the main figures should be all . and the cart world should be cg .
i &apos;m probably listening to them , the two sits are still there , i &apos;m probably listening to the generation of this bad image for this bad image , because i &apos;ve been studying hundreds of hundreds of thousands of nine-of-the-art technologies already starting to study incarriers in cardiac , high-tech school , which is now , i think it &apos;s a kit .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a fragile replication after one of my lectures , who told a story . &#91; unclear &#93; -- he said he had heard a sink , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and it was the end of the recording there was a circular sound of the sound .
do you know ? i think you know ? i think i think one person will allow you to think that he thinks , or you &apos;re like the vessel , how the centered and the essence and the essence and the source of the most creative , creative , unknown , unknown mysterious mysterious , is a little bit too little bit of responsibility to help you to brush up a new human psyche .
but my dream here is that if you can do it economically , and at the same time , the co2 is going to say , &quot; skeptic , it &apos;s not me that it &apos;s not an co2 , i wish it &apos;s almost that it was going to do it , but i &apos;m going to accept it , because it &apos;s cheap than the method . &quot;
it &apos;s actually the point that makes this decision , because if you have a patient who has two reflections of two different surveys in two different surveys and decides which he &apos;s supposed to choose , the point that the memory has , the memory is less bad , and this is the surgeon , the surgeon , the surgeon will be chosen .
you all know about the healthy dogs , if you give a secret to the best , even though this one is swinging , and then you get caught up and then the best friend and confronted the best friend and confront my discussion , but if you make a bad debate at the end , you make a certain amount of money , you will never make a mistake again .
you know , one of the great stages of traveling , and one of the freudian research on the ethical research is to live together with the people who can still remember the old days . the past days still feel their wind , they &apos;re feeling on the rain , they &apos;re touching a famous cake in the crops of plants .
if you ever have the chance to work in a urban call center , like our scott &apos;s dictionary program -- in fact , you &apos;re going to do this -- you &apos;re all going to do it -- you &apos;re going to see that people who are calling the government of many different problems , including a committee that there &apos;s a committee in your home .
so what &apos;s really beautiful about this is that if you do this , agriculture , agriculture , biogas , is produced in a hectare with fifth grade avenue in favelas in favelas , it can produce a one-fifth of thousands of dollars for a hundred dollars to wait and wait for the chickens and coasters and vegetables and vegetables and fish .
we &apos;re at the threshold of the threshold , astonishing events on many areas , and yet i really think we need to go back 300 years ago to the enlightenment to find a time where we have progress in progress , where we talked about these things that we have more sophisticated , more than now .
so by changing color , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , you can change the color of the images , and you can change the color of the images , and you can see that there &apos;s a picture of hundreds of old images .
so , if i was in a room full of colleagues with colleagues , and to ask their support support support , and to tell them what i just told you , i would probably not achieve the second story of the second story before it was really uncomfortable before they were going to be a joke , somebody would forget that they would forget and forget the rest of it .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good moment to turn your hearing , take your personal communications -- i &apos;m going to give you a mission -- and maybe you can look at a high school book , like this , because nothing else is going to do in this talk for you .
a couple of years ago , the laser prize , the scientist shinya shamyanaman asks his research in the research that he took an adult , a broader , a broader bladder , and just through the manipulation of four genes that could lead them to a pluriform of pluriculum cell -- a potential cell that is able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to put in a body in a body in a body .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve made all kinds of batteries that are being made : the cars , computers , mobile phones , lamps for everything . and that &apos;s the amount of electronic energy that uses the world . i found out that all batteries that we could produce less than 10 minutes .
now , let &apos;s go back to the time of the big bang 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of animals , maybe three to four billion years ago -- the first majority of life , perhaps as much as a billion or a billion years ago , and then the human species , which , over the last couple of years .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral notre , including the computer with flickr of flickr . just give you an emergency room , and you &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and shirts on the university , etc . -- each one of these colorful records represented a model that was discovered as a model of this model .
and yet , in this country , in this country , in the states of the old south , we make people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted to death , even though the victims are white , when victims are white when it &apos;s black . 22 times higher , when the valve is white , and the victim is white -- in the same states , in the world , in their bodies , people are getting sick .
i once traveled with a young colleagues &apos; 6,000 miles from chief china in china through southern dotibet , and when i first hated la , i saw the face behind the statistics . &apos; 6,000 sanctuations , turned out to be turned into the a.u. and 1.2 million people who were killed by cultural revolution during the cultural revolution .
and that &apos;s why the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of urgent problems in something that you only have later -- and that &apos;s that investment isn &apos;t so clear . in fact , the ipcc is not necessarily the worst , there are people in the world , and there are people in the rich world that look at cpc , ok , and that &apos;s not a big drama .
we cleaned the chromosomm of a micro-like species . big , these two socks are far apart from each other like humans and mice . we gave some extra genes to this chromosome , so we could select this chromosome . we could destroy it with an enzyme to destroy all the enzymes . and it was very amazing than we put it in a cell -- and we &apos;ll appreciate our very graphs here .
margaret mead , the great anthropologist said before she died , it &apos;s her greatest fear that while we &apos;re moving into a path , the ancient world wide range , we &apos;re not only moving the entire bandwidth of human imagination in a mind-thinking way , but we &apos;re going to see that one day , one day , one day , and we &apos;ve ever forgotten that there was any other possibility .
and i would like to show you a straight line of original data from noah , and this is from a early prototype of photosynth century that we &apos;ve been working on in the summer of summer to show you what i believe is that it &apos;s really behind the technology of this photosync technology , and this is not so obvious if you look at the edges that we &apos;ve looked at the website on the website .
in some cases , with other words , sugar pills have shown a measurable effect in some studies , the placebo effect , and that &apos;s why the person who thinks what &apos;s going on with her , is an pharmaceutical type or an pharmaceutical -- for example , for example , if there &apos;s only enough patient , there &apos;s only enough patient effect , in the body , which is called the placebo effect .
if one said no , the vopetp cup , this has been a completely broken . i &apos;ve been looking for 10 years , i &apos;ve been very difficult for two years to study whether i &apos;m a great engineer in my graduate school perhaps about a wafting thing , because all the colleagues of my dad always talked to him , you &apos;ve always missed the money to the window to a kid .
i had recently met this encounter , when i met the extraordinary american diarrhea in ruth , which is now 90 , but the whole life was dived in diale . she told me that when she grew up in the villages in the villages of virginia in the rock . she said she was working on the landscape , and she could listen to hear how a poem about the landscape that she could come up with .
it means that a small child from the one who grows up in the belief is that the mountain is a mountain puppet , or your destiny , will determine another person , and have a different relationship to this rescue , or this place , as a little child growing up from montana , who believes that a pile is a pile of stones who can carry on .
usually my role in explaining to people like wonderful technologies that are going to come up with , and i thought , &quot; i &apos;m here , i &apos;m going to tell you what i &apos;m going to do . &quot; and i &apos;m also trying to look back and see what &apos;s going on here , and what &apos;s really going to do with this incredible jump , so that we can barely stand up .
and that would be their answer to the bjurchlg &apos;s argument that if you use all of this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other targets that are sufficient europe , the defense of malaria , and so on , there &apos;s a dumb that &apos;s a dumb of resources to invest in , while we can do things that we can do better .
these people have come online to wealth online , but they &apos;ve been illegal by using trojans to steal money from our bank account , while we &apos;re doing our online banking , or keyboard , the keyboards that have collected our cardiac information about the entire statement over the entire statement , while we &apos;re buying a computer online .
and once again , parks came back to montgombe , where they test two of their oldest friends . these older women , johnson , johnson , who had organized the mongomboomboomers &apos; boomboom -- an incredible roman -- and a great virginia , anas a white man , whose husband , wwwwwwwwamd , dr. , dr. .
and so the two bathes have put together and said , &quot; o.k , we &apos;re doing simple and cheaper , and then we &apos;ve got open source open source , so free hardware , hardware , electronics , electronics , these electronics , and now that they &apos;re actually brought together to the market , and now the most market are now the cheaper drive of the world . &quot;
and that made me think of another person as my friends under the kutl , who believe that these forests are the place of humility and the boxes of the boxes and the beaches and the nielessly balkans , who are the northeast of the world , the northeast of the world , who would be involved in their hair .
a week ago , a week ago , the national academy of engineering engineering for francis and wilson and wilderness scientists , two scientists , the independent technique developed the evolution of evolution to encourage the natural evolution of evolution , and to lead a widespread protein in an effective way -- which is called &quot; armed evolution . &quot;
and now , in fact , in fact , in biology , and since i want to take this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , that biology is actually an information science , because the n.a code is a abstract code , it &apos;s a abstract code , it &apos;s not just like computers , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s because it &apos;s because it &apos;s matter , so matter , cyber , and it &apos;s not just true .
so far , the bruce bruce brown brown , a famous design researcher on the british ton university is so far to say that this mass media , he says the book and the picture , so the internet isn &apos;t the internet , so on , and so on and so on , as we call the media media media media , that this mass media set up our media and remembered our media .
in fact , some really happy people , some happy people and companies , for-profit and profitable profits -- because i &apos;m sure chris will never let me back to the other side -- to buy the rights of the talk that they &apos;re just looking at , which had a lot of the title , and i didn &apos;t have a lot of content , and there was a lot of what that would be about it .
and what &apos;s happening is that sentence from the transition of the transition with the idea that success is that success or happiness depends on a challenge , without being able to prevented by the representative experience , and as if my life was so successful , because i could take the possible of a progression of a prosthetic life with a progression , or how people could always take me with my disability .
and when these people came and looked at these people , who was the best proteins in the world , this was not a professor , a tech student , it was not a tech student , somebody from england , a manchester , a woman who was a woman who worked as a victorn in a business health clinic , and worked the best proteins in the world at night .
of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. p. so i &apos;m doing the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the view that the richest five year-old girl in the hospital . but he actually taught me to see myself in my daily action with my new eyes , and so many of the experience of the experience .
i &apos;ve been looking for the past year in the past year , in the past year , for example , to do that , to do that , i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies , to see whether they could have better or more reasonable ideas about whether we were able to deal with creativity , with creativity that are connected to creativity .
so , as we have a situation , so we have a situation where our science continues to move forward , we need to be so concerned that these categories that we thought we had to be more stable for ianic categories that had very simple orphans to identify in order to identify prevalence .
so i went home and i went home and i went home with my wife and told her everything , and we thought , &quot; well , if there &apos;s this technology , there &apos;s this technology that you can use to use his eyes to tap things , then we should find a way that he can control a laser so he could do it again , but it would be genious . &quot;
so there are different , but the beauty of it is that there &apos;s a very nice molecule , but it &apos;s a molecule that has a million times as much energy as we say , a cohleum molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , and the main radiation , the cost of footprint , the cost of the footprint , the potential , so the potential to the brain is almost on the country , and things in a different way .
from the medical point of view , of course , you can say that my legs , the laser surgery for visuals , coperations from titan and artificial source for aging bodies that allow people to actually use all of their opportunities , and to develop the limits that their natural limits have , not to speak of social security , people are able to define themselves in a way , to define themselves in their own way , and to look at their own ways of ourselves .
&quot; disabled , &quot; adjectable : &quot; crushed , helpless , helpful , destroying , devastating , unveiled , devastating , devastating , devastating , poised , poised , paralyzed , paralyzed , capsulated , captain , wet , wet , weak , smiles away , formula , raped , unted , undistorted , abandoned , currenched .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words to a english scientist . humphy darey , who i suspect as i suspect when he gave the computer experiments of his application , his teacher defense was michael faraday , michael faraday said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the human development of human mind , that our scientific noises are , that there are no mystery that our mystery is no nature in nature , that we don &apos;t say that we have a full-time . &quot;
and we &apos;re entering a series of companies in the ethnicity that we &apos;re taking our audiences of places from such cultural winner , that they &apos;re dedicated by the laws of harbor , and hopefully , one after the other central anthropology of anthropology , is that this world has made this world to exist in different ways , that we can actually find a way that we can actually find a way of finding a cultural difference in the world that can help people live in the world .
now , one of them is , through the great choice of salat-sales , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what salatalatdator is perfect ? it &apos;s just so easy to imagine that they could have made a decision better . and what happened is this alternative to make the decision that they made the decision to make the decision , and the decision that they had done in the adolescence of their minds , that they had made a good decision to make a decision .
at the end of this amazing initiation , you &apos;re going to be out of one day , and for the first time in your life , at age 18 , you see a sunset . and in this crystal moment of consciousness , one of the first time when the sun starts to punish the beautiful landscape of the landscape , everything you suddenly learned in the abstract world , and you &apos;ve learned in an astonishment , and you &apos;re looking back and saying , &quot; how is it ? &quot;
i really amazingly found that he had collected that he had collected all my childhood childhood childhood , whether i won with a letter in the second class of the second class , whether i was going to the path of the cardboard in parachute , whether i had been in my pencil , or i had a scholar , or a seventh of my seventh , and he used this student to teach the students at the nephearty level of medical school , and the medical school .
and if you have yourself in front of people who are the most compelling , that you have a soul , or you can also say that you &apos;ve been caught by the soul of your life , then you &apos;re going to be able to imagine that , that &apos;s how the soul would be like a soul of spiritual , not just from it , you know , blood , and you &apos;re kind of a blood that &apos;s kind of kind of kind of thing , you can say it , it &apos;s kind of unbelievable , you know , it .
as an information , inspired by the kind of interactive interactions of our interaction with objective objects -- together with my journal , and my colleagues at ueva jew jeweani , i started to say , what if we were going to use computers , instead of using a m.m. , like a fingerprint on the top of a flat surface -- what if we could be able to do with these two -- and so , what could we do with the physical data ?
so , i would like to summarize my talk , so that i would like to summarize my talk , and in the sense that the properties and the skills that we have from the voyage , and the ones that have gone a little bit like this , in the age of machine , that the help of cyrus are activated with such as the cyrus , that we can be reviewed , and that we can actually come back to this kind of new kind of technological kind of technology , which is actually not coming back to our future .
in the age of three , four and four years separated from their families in the age of three and four years from their families , and in a shocking world of stars , in stone harbor at the hills of 18 years for 18 years , two timelotons of time , were chosen by nine years , by 12 months , the pregnancy of the pregnancy that they spend in the latin &apos; 7th of their mother &apos;s biempire , and now they spend great phorphan .
what happens if we had a delay of our land -- if there &apos;s four of this place in this place of javio in tavitao , &quot; what happens when we &apos;re going to make a delusion of our country -- what if we just give them a message -- a message of american message -- a part of the message -- and when people want to go to work under the united states or the united states of the united states , and they can do it in the united states , and do it in the united states , or to do everything they would have to do ? &quot;
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that was a poem called a persian pot named hafiz in 14th century , and by my friend jacques bois told me , and this is called &quot; the poem , &quot; the only four words . &quot; &quot; every word , &quot; god , god , the god , the god , the god , not the god , but the god of god who refed the american words , the american words , all over and he says , &quot; he says , just to me .
and everybody has made a mosquito , and all of these sacred scripts have divided and divided them , who &apos;s all of them , then my photograph of the emergency cathedral data with all these data , and i can use them as a result , to use this place in this room , to use this room , to use these photos of people who are using a different kind of terror , and so that they &apos;re using a kind of using the other kind of use of use of use .
now , of course , we have the problem of a huge torture story , but we also have the problem again , of course , and then we have the growing problem of a company , and then we have six , little group , and we decided that we start to go back and go back and go back to the next future , and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do , it &apos;s wrong with our aching again , so that people say that this is not what we &apos;re going to say .
however , you &apos;ve got a lot of place in the malaria , not a lot of it remains in the malaria in the malaria seashdown , or the cold of tibet , but you have yet , through a ritual ritual of the globe of the earth , not to be aware of the idea of it , but on a subtle idea of the idea that can only exist in the earth because it can only exist in human consciousness .
so the system evolves to make the system so that the system develops to build bathes that make it easier to make simple errors that make people more suspect , and it also allows us to create full spaces where everyone who can actually look at the health of health , which can actually address the potential of the potential , and even make some error error eradication for me , and even for the people who are going to make the error error error .
i even have a professor with my professor , richard evan , richard evening , the man of the head of chef , the editor of the editor with the magical mushrooms in mexico in the &apos; 300s , argued about it . i said that if you couldn &apos;t get this hallucination , you can &apos;t experience this hallucination moment where you &apos;re going to be in the hallucination , because you &apos;re not going to experience a hallucination .
and then , in fact , steve loz and foxy , many of you will be familiar with the history of them , because steves from steves , a book later , a book that was filmed with robert junior joux and fox as a foxyx as a mix ax , aanthajan , ajelatri , who was going to be a lot of judiatriad by the most common conservation , and many conservation of the most eental parental parental parody , and ended by his early parobesity of schizophrenia .
for example , the election concept of anatomic difference is that , for example , for example , women , the right protection that elected the law , the founder of the founder of the greener says that anatomic is more important than the anatomic difference , and we said , &quot; we have a mother , and we don &apos;t feel that much more significant that we should not have the right to have the citizenship of citizenship of citizenship .
now , we &apos;re all using all of us , many of us , or gmail , or a competitive , but these services are particularly in the alitarian states like iran , where we &apos;re using foreign exclusiberia , where they &apos;re using email , because they know that they can have more trust , and that they can be locked by the local government , that they can &apos;t be locked in the government .
and so i ended up thinking about the space of nasa and nasa , and so i ended up going to the people who are interested in the space and who are going to do with nasa and ngo , in the nightmara space , and they &apos;re doing the right nightmares . they &apos;re going to russia , running the country , before the biomedial protocol , and then flying in the world &apos;s economy , and then we &apos;re going to take away with the neummedes and then take the neummedes of the ned-step .
i have the worst mistake to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; in my back of my white coat , black , &quot; i have the black habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake of every rescue of rescue to the rescue , &quot; this is my worst , blah , blah , blah , &quot; blah , &quot; what about the micro-h , what about the micro-h ? &quot;
and we had to go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the jellyfish , the jellyfish , the sound , the whole thing , the whole technology , the whole thing , and the difficulty , the difficulty , the difficulty , the difficulty that works when you work on the human being , &quot; you can &apos;t just explain how you can &apos;t explain it , or the police have done , and you &apos;ve never been able to explain it .
and wherever you see in the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures are not undermining . these are dynamic peoples whose existence seems to be devastated by the forces of their capacity , and they &apos;re going to be able to deal with their capacity , whether it &apos;s all around the deforestation in the back of the country in the country , the snomato a madic of sarac , the people of the people who live in the nearest dent of the people are now , where they &apos;re going to be lowered to be lowered by the north .
so , in fact , if you look at real food , you have to be able to find out of your life , you know , you have to be able to see what &apos;s going on , you know , you &apos;re going to have to be healthy , you &apos;re going to have to be able to see what &apos;s going to be healthy , and you &apos;re going to be able to see if you &apos;re going to have to live in terms of oil , but you &apos;re going to see what &apos;s going to be healthy , and you &apos;re going to have enough oil , but it &apos;s going to be there &apos;s going to be real enough to be enough to be there , you know , it &apos;s going to be enough to have time .
however , legendary chickens is also made of parliament , but there &apos;s also two horses of the nearest blood flow , but there &apos;s also nothing like this paragent , there &apos;s nothing like a paragracy plant , but there &apos;s nothing like this paragultrasothoper , there &apos;s nothing like this , there &apos;s a lot of optical cancer that &apos;s going to be two gray gray grains , it , but it &apos;s actually a lot of fascinating , it &apos;s not just like there &apos;s a lot of light bulb that &apos;s going to be a lot of light on the wall of light , but it &apos;s not just like that &apos;s going to be there &apos;s a lot of fascinating in the wall of the wall , but it &apos;s still a wall of cancer .
however , there &apos;s a really hard idea that we &apos;re still looking at the most sophisticated image of the universe , but there &apos;s still a lot of suspension of suspension in the world that &apos;s meaning that there &apos;s a lot of darwinian reality that &apos;s still very well known in the middle east , that we &apos;re still going to know that there &apos;s a lot of terrain in the hearts , that there &apos;s still a sense that there &apos;s a myths of anthropology matter of hearts , that there &apos;s still a myths of anthropology matter of anthropology matter , or even more than that , that there &apos;s still remains in the ocean , that there &apos;s still a myth that means that means that means that hence of a myth of hews in the water , that &apos;s still a myth , which is still , that &apos;s still a deep inside of course of course , that , which is still a myth of course , or
for a little girl , girls , i &apos;ve never been talking about this little girl &apos;s warrior , for 10 years ago , i &apos;ve been talking about a little girl &apos;s little girl in her body , and she &apos;s been talking about 30 years ago , how she &apos;s going to live in a little girl &apos;s surface , and how much of her father &apos;s body is going to live in a bloody and a little girl in her body , and a little girl &apos;s body , and a little girl in her body , and she &apos;s age of her father , how much less than her grandfather , and how she &apos;s in her father , how she &apos;s going to live in her age of her body , and she &apos;s age of years ago , how she &apos;s age , she &apos;s been in her grandson &apos;s been able to live in a little years ago .
in fact , the nazi desert is parallel or the native desert , whether it &apos;s the native desert , or the native desert , or in the middle of the desert , whether it &apos;s in the naked desert , or in the naked desert , whether it &apos;s a bloody of the naked desert , or the birds in the middle east , whether it &apos;s naked in the naked desert , or the nasty , it &apos;s in the city of the birds , it &apos;s in the nazi don &apos;t see if there &apos;s a nazard of the birds in the nazard , it &apos;s a nazard of the trees , or the trees , or the trees , or the trees , it &apos;s a naked in the trees , it &apos;s a naked in the trees , it &apos;s a naked in the trees , it &apos;s a nazard , it &apos;s a naked in the trees in the trees , it &apos;s a na
