thank you .
from seattle ...
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s the singing .
but it goes .
it &apos;s not happening .
yeah , hello .
we love innovation .
solar is ...
that &apos;s not ...
we were poor .
are they all ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
after a week .
great trick ?
we were .
a few less .
and he says ...
we know that .
ta-dah !
stop twice .
here it is .
that goes fast .
they need time .
music as a language .
that &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... not yet .
thank you .
what a fish .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
this is efficient .
wonderful , right ?
completely inefficient .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much .
clean it .
the only opportunity .
also not a hospital .
thank you very much .
stephen watts .
three out of 10 .
that was incredible .
thank you . thank you .
yeah , in a way .
it &apos;s terrible .
long , yes .
fantastic , right ?
the sun goes down .
oh my god .
we love entertainment .
we pick it up .
where does it go ?
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we lose them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
a whole bunch of things .
does that sound good ?
the whole environmental discussion .
sounds familiar , what ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
that &apos;s great .
that was fascinating .
can i be honest ?
the farm is incredible .
what did they do ?
robert gupta .
this is the system .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
yeah , good day .
move , slowly .
that &apos;s all i &apos;m interested in .
we can do that .
what do you say ?
not very sustainable .
yeah , milliseconds .
that &apos;s our present .
they have similar principles .
yeah , good day .
good work ! yeah !
just make your job .
this was the result .
thank you very much .
and she did .
so they meet al .
it &apos;s essential .
they &apos;re all important .
very different term .
it &apos;s unbelievable .
that &apos;s me even .
this is broadcast .
yeah , that goes .
flying cat .
this is the last one .
can we change it ?
these days are over .
these guys deserve money .
what happened here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
she did it again .
and that &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know .
centers were built .
what happened here ?
but you know what ?
what was the result ?
i was amazed .
it &apos;s general .
so they knew everything .
you could see manhattan .
here &apos;s the video .
it has sensors .
why not live longer ?
he opens the door .
there are a couple more .
that &apos;s very good .
oh , so the one .
there &apos;s no normal .
yeah , i know .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
but you know what ?
i have a question .
okay . thank you .
i was standing up to him .
players don &apos;t sit around .
so they do that .
it &apos;s bad . &quot;
so let &apos;s see .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work .
what do these people need ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i thought about it .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
they use their hands .
so how does this work ?
how they are .
that would have been fine .
what are media today ?
they can go in .
so where do we go ?
so it &apos;s true .
how do we know that ?
because you know what ?
it &apos;s not a country .
why do we do that ?
not often very often .
bg : thank you .
this is a wish .
and i was an artist .
let &apos;s call him .
not school management .
and the one has to go back .
we can do it differently .
they even do weh .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
a tremendous challenge .
there &apos;s no feed .
it &apos;s against justice .
but the wrong things .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
i &apos;m a writer .
here &apos;s another example .
i meet children .
it feels great .
i swear .
i wonder .
that &apos;s not going to be done .
thank you very much .
why should we do that ?
thank you .
here &apos;s an example .
you see it immediately .
not toxic .
but i continued to work .
or before bombs .
i &apos;ll go in here .
there are two possibilities .
we need energy miracles .
why does this happen at all ?
oh . a moment .
let me tell you .
what do you want to do ?
this is what happens to us today .
and i continued to work .
so she was back .
and that &apos;s how it was .
yeah , here it is .
i totally agree with you .
and why is that ?
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what would it be done ?
i mean the soul .
you hire the same thing .
in china , it was different .
luckily , right ?
that &apos;s not a protection .
bear with pee a .
does anybody see anything ?
and i always had that .
very expensive mobilization .
people were playing crazy .
what is the illusion ?
my gut feeling again .
after just a journey .
first of all , limited .
i created a bow .
yeah . well . all right .
imagine the camera .
jk : both of them .
but it gets worse .
so here you see it .
thank you very much .
be a mentor .
maybe 10 times as many .
but it didn &apos;t .
the data came in .
this is a great question .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
it has billions of them .
have you seen these guys ?
but there &apos;s something else .
here &apos;s another example .
is it photography ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
ohhh .
and then it became international .
there were remixes .
let me wrap up .
okay , a few more .
the answer is no .
just keep it . fun .
my name is amit .
he had the experience .
it keeps you fresh .
this is a great question .
is that your opinion ?
a almost identical structure .
and it became better .
that &apos;s what she did .
it really loved him .
here you see the city .
good afternoon , everyone .
will i like the color ?
ooh , thank you .
some have gone and gone .
i think , not more .
dk : 60,000 .
there &apos;s an old study .
don &apos;t be discouraged .
the game is from 2007 .
that &apos;s not true of emotions .
he &apos;s called paul open .
what do you think happened ?
who &apos;s going to make it safer ?
we first have the population .
i don &apos;t like that question .
but what does your fish eat ?
we call it &quot; don &apos;t call it . &quot;
this is precautionary .
the work of interpreting .
but where are we useful ?
they had no mass media .
how do we actually work people ?
... his own story .
i will never forget that .
so , what does that mean ?
now , what does that mean ?
privacy has to be passed .
there are online criminals .
we have three main groups .
it was still fish .
he &apos;s always showed up here .
and then it happened again .
i felt really good .
and a lot of people forget this .
crisis . death . disaster .
it would be inexhaustible .
it &apos;s not our fight .
it &apos;s not our problem .
we lost the contact .
why not think about it ?
we love technology and creativity .
it would be knowledge .
we &apos;re constantly breaking up .
and this opens a map .
but what do we do with this ?
that &apos;s about it .
what do i look at ?
his name is tempt .
is it going to have my size ?
that sounds crazy , right ?
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
we need to spread the message .
that &apos;s what most of you know .
you also have to understand that .
you see that down there .
i want to ask you something .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and luckily , he didn &apos;t die .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was destroyed at the ground .
and then they look like this .
is it about light ?
i grew up in india .
that &apos;s the short constitution .
you see the water coming .
i had a good life .
so what happened after that ?
who are those relatives ?
i wanted to keep us healthy .
these changes are coming in .
what about fitness ?
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
but the crucial thing is ...
he works like this .
and then they set up .
what &apos;s actually happened there ?
the orange tractor .
they really loved it .
but i felt worse .
they called me to the two .
woman : overlegendary technology .
very frightening .
what is the soul ?
we &apos;re not producing ourselves anymore .
i can claim everything .
he went up and down .
what else can we do ?
this is what the graphics looked like .
now i get to the end .
perhaps that &apos;s the reality .
it may sound bad .
we were 20 people .
so we &apos;re too many .
you can &apos;t have bone .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
or is it possible ?
conflict emerged from conflicts .
so what do we need to do ?
they had no books .
this is felix .
actually , i made two mistakes .
thank you for your attention .
that was the beginning of the journey .
i am honored .
and then everyone went down .
they saw the great evaluation .
first extension , second .
well , i was the next one .
let &apos;s face it -- who &apos;s normal ?
and finally , epic meaning .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
the same thing , just bigger .
who is most successful ?
you want to feed the world ?
i wanted to support them .
it &apos;s almost nothing more left .
i only loved two .
the place is south korea .
again , you &apos;ve got it again .
this is such a natural thing .
my wife told me .
and how did that feel ?
because that &apos;s what you can train .
do you do that curiosity ?
so it &apos;s full circle .
so , why hacks ?
this happened around christmas .
what is this thing for ?
that &apos;s how , you know .
they could have done better .
the answer is , &quot; yes . &quot;
i don &apos;t have to worry !
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
is that reasonable ?
so that &apos;s the good news .
it was a huge success .
so they saw something magical .
&quot; yeah , &quot; he said .
2.5 , one , great .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
but there &apos;s no problem at all .
they &apos;re always saying , why ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
it was just not invented .
because of course , vibration should work .
does anybody know what this is ?
for example , this perception in context .
this is a game for outside .
this is god , you know ?
but it was very sad .
so let me remind you .
the answer is no . &quot;
and it &apos;s the crux .
sometimes i get too much .
but they do the job .
they connected these two people .
her mother moved her mother alone .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
think of your own decisions .
this picture is from this place .
i see this character .
and it took 18 months .
tell me about this world .
this is very risky .
and that worked very well .
and the one showed him four .
i learned everything .
and there are hundreds of them .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there &apos;s good news .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
it really made me sad .
so what is the next step ?
but that &apos;s not how fast it goes .
how can we help you ? &quot;
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
no , no , never had a chance .
the story is not over .
what happened on this day ?
well , let &apos;s do it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
that &apos;s how you feel . &quot;
they come from the artists .
i should not say that .
the power station can explode .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
she did it for three years .
you can have these cloud .
the data had not been available before .
play is not albern .
now , how could that happen ?
is this all just education ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
so we can do that too .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
they don &apos;t have changed the story .
everybody talks about happiness today .
it doesn &apos;t tap very well .
play is not just child games .
and that was 19 years ago .
which one would you like to most ?
they create a epic story .
they have so much uncertainty .
the data is constantly adding .
nobody ever said that before .
so paul is a terrorist .
and he actually says that .
don &apos;t take anything but b .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what should our experience look like ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
i never cook it .
she was back and die .
and of course , this is incredible .
and here &apos;s the picture again .
the one didn &apos;t have that soul .
a autistic student .
if at the moment , that &apos;s the waste .
so not like detox .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
we depend on two countries .
everyone needs a goldfish glass .
let &apos;s be here . &quot;
people were still happy .
it was my first sunk .
in fact , he gathered fish .
my name is brian goldman .
they share their experiences with others .
the white lines are for population .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
he showed up the algae .
it &apos;s just not technological .
there are four and a half thousand people living .
and you have a problem .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
every waste is nutrient .
and so we &apos;re too many .
so the question is : how ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and it was an incredible experience .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
but there are two problems with this .
i started feeling better .
but , you know what ?
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
that was grandiose .
i talk a lot about these questions .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
we are in an area .
and that &apos;s what we did .
basically they do the same thing .
this is now one of the images .
what other brands are doing ?
and then something weird happened .
they can play with different kinds of play .
the whole building was made of water .
italy . yeah .
the morning , before the game .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
the creativity kind of had to get out of it .
today , everything is easy to have .
asked the nurse &apos;s sister .
i should probably not do that .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
and it starts with a doctor .
i &apos;m going to tell you something .
we use the energy of the sun .
these are all the metadata .
because i can claim everything .
it will always be similar to you .
slowly , but it was very sure .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , isn &apos;t it ?
what are they trying to achieve ? &quot;
so , as a result , we don &apos;t .
what kind of lessons do we learn ?
and the shape plays a role .
you can &apos;t store energy .
then i can translate the whole thing .
okay , that &apos;s really what makes the courage .
once we started a vibrating .
my second mistake was worse .
and it &apos;s a 257 .
we all love baseball , right ?
somehow , kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
this is about five meters long .
they become computers in the free place .
because does anybody have a mask ?
and then he &apos;s talking to him .
below the other things should not suffer .
this has the greatest impact .
the reason to write it .
anyway , not to navigate .
and that &apos;s pretty much the beginning .
the truth is more like this .
do you want to end up with holes ?
that &apos;s how you can &apos;t do anything .
and his answer was , &quot; yes . &quot;
their family gathered together .
thank you very much for your patience .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
what else is risk ?
just be you , who you are .
i remember my first fire .
what about a story ?
it &apos;s dark . dark .
now i was trying to do something more exciting .
but it &apos;s effective , right ?
but we need to do that .
nullemissions , yeah ?
this is completely trivial .
let &apos;s take that quiet .
hmmm , my brand ?
this is scary .
that sounds scary .
next : nuclear power .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
i was going to be normal at that time .
this is what i &apos;m going to show you now .
as soon as the judge saw me .
we can &apos;t do that .
so i went to the dish .
i got some scared of technology .
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
and there are several reasons for this .
they sell certificate .
it &apos;s not documented .
why did i go to medicine ?
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s spreading out .
all adults were aware of the risks .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i like things that are different .
i went to jail -- difficult .
it didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
this is a child game , right ?
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
and this video is in real time .
the game starts to -- silence .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
what about longevity ?
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
so the correlation is low .
so , look what happens .
it &apos;s really changed the dynamics .
so i just started playing on play .
and then we said , okay .
yeah , these are the data .
i &apos;m shooting a little bit through the head .
have you ever been to disk ?
that &apos;s how to learn to learn .
because for me , it means memory .
what did he recommend ?
we say in germany .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
music is medicine . music changes us .
it turns out it &apos;s really difficult .
and you know what i learned ?
these are going to be unresistant .
but what will happen in the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
that has nothing to do with science .
and that can make a big difference .
but there &apos;s another reason .
anyway , we need a solution .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
so that &apos;s what i hear , thank you very much .
they fought the canals .
in the presence of maybe two percent .
we started this 15 years ago .
how far are you going to get there ?
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
you know what the hell is ?
so the first step is to take a interpretation .
and it &apos;s still not a interpretation .
that has to be the difference .
if you come on , yeah ?
you can show , i was there .
that &apos;s just the minimum .
we can get our nutrients back .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
on the book and on the picture .
this picture reminded me of something .
i think they &apos;re abundant .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but perhaps that &apos;s not the case .
and what does that mean for designers ?
i want to prove to you that .
it was a pretty destiny project .
here he leaves the sun .
this is where the memory is going .
these rivers are taking rains .
a has these benefits and risks .
our magazines are read by millions .
lego made it possible for everyone .
privacy is not the debate .
they were genetically recovered .
i &apos;m the new york doctor .
i don &apos;t take the same course .
baseball is full of great statistics .
because we live on a water planet .
do we really want to go to this direction ?
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
and these are the neural structures .
they didn &apos;t give the government .
oh , my time is over ?
something happened to me .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
so we measured its movement .
this is a picture of the object .
it was quite popular .
you see a little fun here .
i really like beautiful clothing .
it can only use its eyes .
but the truth is far from that .
you can do this all the time .
so this crazy story could be true .
who would ever wish one wish ?
the defeat would have been easy .
her father died shortly after her birth .
we had no cents a year .
we need to increase the complexity slowly .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
here &apos;s her march line .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
but then you really want to go deep .
you want to orient in the museum ?
this was more to concrete .
okay , you really want to know ?
and i had to get out of the city .
we won some awards .
who doesn &apos;t want to be healthier ?
it makes poems to children .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
no , i mean it really serious .
i think the knife in my hand .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to shoot my sleeve back .
architects and engineers , luck .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
now i see greg moon .
a billion people today are hungry .
do you do that for the children ? &quot;
i fell in love with this fish .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and this sounds very different than before .
he was already there .
i started a institute .
they even bring it to financial .
the film hasn &apos;t been done yet .
we need to think about what brands are .
what do you do with it ? &quot;
i call this the bright tiger .
we &apos;ve been waiting since 1994 .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
this is ideology , not science .
and that brought me through that ...
today , 6.8 billion people live .
it &apos;s going to be that simple .
it &apos;s about blessing .
today , the projectors were dreaming .
automatically runs the right idea .
so the natural things are proposed .
but it requires a lot of planning .
we can do anything again .
as we think of north .
and the phosphorus depends on phosphorus .
often in the third run , again .
it &apos;s longer than these other two networks .
the stones are color codes .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
it &apos;s about measurable values .
i started with my usual talk .
this is a very sensitive question .
i learned this from my grandmother .
now we do this with airplanes .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
we didn &apos;t written this app .
and every morning i jump to that .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
the pedestrians are very good .
what would you describe ?
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
there are also escaps .
what is the right thing to ask ?
the people over the uranium .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
the living feature is the spirits .
they gave their blood pressure .
thank you , but the best part is coming .
we &apos;ve achieved a kind of balance .
happy productivity . fantastic !
the result of this was catastrophic .
and everyone in this room has to come in .
here &apos;s the olive oil .
bjn village sundn .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
i think there are possibilities everywhere .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about that .
we have a lot of procedures .
this may be used to be public .
my brother starved at me .
these are the apple saras .
i talked a lot about magic .
who could have imagined it ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who do you want to actually inform with it ?
completely focused on a particular goal .
what do you think it &apos;s going to happen next ?
they &apos;ve got them . they &apos;ve always got them .
so this is a hard disk .
it &apos;s only constant .
they literally put the lever around .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
most of all , when he died .
so it &apos;s created two circles .
the byproduct is clean water .
this sounds basically unusual .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you always lose rare animals .
she &apos;s going to touch her deeply .
he died through the story .
here &apos;s how the building works .
they went through each other .
tell them what they feel .
the other one had a big chance .
let &apos;s make a little picture .
so here you have this little mechanism .
there he got involved .
the person is interested in what they do .
the question is , what &apos;s going on now ?
students are divided after grades .
these things are logically correct .
and this is where you feel it .
for energy , i noticed this one .
i tried to understand it .
all these generations need only a few milliseconds .
and it seems that no one seems to come up with it .
that i had written these crazy things .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
this is also a paradigm shift .
a dalmatiner , right .
you can see from the back to the front .
so from the modern society to computer society .
and that &apos;s exactly what they &apos;re doing .
we have to come far , and it &apos;s fast .
it &apos;s about a new supply of america .
they &apos;re all inherent questions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they are the home countries of somebody .
we go through passenger rituals .
now look at this curve .
jowiskills are simply belong to our lives .
i meet people in death cells .
they kept us from being inspired .
leadership maybe some mutations .
so scott , he gets this fruit .
we worked until late the night .
so i followed my gut feeling .
he moved back to silence .
now we saw the reverse effect .
polite all the audiences are applauded .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
you brought your paintings , right ?
so ... so , not so optimistic .
he switches off the bloodline .
let &apos;s take a look at what &apos;s going on .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
they had a concept of blue blood .
i believed everybody could do that .
i never met him personally .
even cats look at this video .
there was jimmy kimmy .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
how would you describe your brand ?
we talk about cows , fresh .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
no , that was what i thought .
i &apos;m a redundancy person .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
this is a painting of a circle .
the roof was also covered with water .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
and women argued the successful .
we can support them to be good .
look at what she does .
the main man wined to me .
sexual reproduction goes into the picture .
i read you the entrance .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
that &apos;s the truth . that &apos;s what i believe .
we &apos;re talking about twin elderly .
it was really immensely profound .
he shaped his head , no .
this will happen in april of the next april .
we also have very accurate data .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
the mechanism is made from the gap .
but with the right design , please .
we can support them to be good .
alone , what is information ?
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
there was never before a time like this .
and even lomg thinks about .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
the other thing about these subsidies .
how will you feed the world ? &quot;
this is an ecologist network .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
i am an expert on relationships . &quot;
the chef used to cook him .
you &apos;re going to kick out like this .
this is such a trapped part .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been shown right now .
what is five milliseconds ?
i see the dalbum .
it may be until it is .
maybe even again , a look behind this .
no , no , you know .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
156 nations send our tv channel .
they tap into their internet connection .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
she wasn &apos;t yet upset .
i &apos;m a man . i make mistakes .
this is the system that we live in .
but i continued to ask these questions .
and that was what i felt .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
you should also want to wish which one wants .
something very strange happened here .
and that was the outbreak of the mind .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
it can know how we hold it .
so it creates a feedback loop .
now , boston has not only one call center .
this is a modest little app .
the ufer comes from another place .
&quot; they didn &apos;t leave them . &quot;
i lived in parallel worlds .
somebody made an old version of it .
and i &apos;d like to read you .
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
you can be logical and intuitive .
tell me a little bit about that part .
make it possible -- everybody here .
tempt is fully paralyzed today .
anyone still knows what that is ?
so this is the reason for this project .
it &apos;s called &quot; i jump . &quot;
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , there &apos;s no way that these things exist .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
we can put ourselves in this way .
so the first exciting comment .
and there &apos;s plenty of employees .
daniel kahman : sure .
everyone would like to make people happier .
the dosification also plays a role .
and why ? genetics changed food .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
we have now in this country .
not the truth will be free .
because now you can apply a three sentence .
you see the timeline up .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
we don &apos;t know why this is happening .
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
thank you , danny nehman .
we get absolutely a flat line on this .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
because we don &apos;t want to shoot genes around ?
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t do that much .
they guide the process , they understand it .
there are a lot of things that have to come together .
and what do you do with the waste ?
bad ? i was completely confused .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we live in a truly extraordinary time .
and then he can walk in .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
his personal versions of the segment .
i &apos;m going to try to do that one thing .
this has to work first as a present .
but let &apos;s start to see a change .
this is a annual water river .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
so litted open source .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
they grow five inches .
maybe i did it with good reason .
&quot; a pop blue dot . &quot;
let &apos;s get something else out here .
it all comes out of our own pockets .
normal people are not accessible . &quot;
as an artist , i think , is very important .
here you see roberto dancing .
and no matter , italy won at the end .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
but the game is a formula .
thank you . i have a question for you .
he had 20 minutes of music .
well , then i &apos;m going to show you .
that &apos;s just an insurance method .
it should contain the two elements .
shaking the environment , less waste .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to talk about in a minute .
yeah . she doesn &apos;t do anything else as a discovery .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
one language is the expression of the human mind .
it was a zaccent .
what you need is a new medical culture .
it &apos;s alone , it &apos;s no support .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
i think our identity is threatened .
many of my clients are very young .
my cousins around .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
here are two different jewelry facilities .
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i have him here on my laptop . &quot;
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist right .
it &apos;s a whole shopping mall .
the difference then is perceived as loss .
in two hours , they &apos;re growing up all over the place .
the emergency room moved all the strands .
no insurance can make a difference .
there are a lot of great books in this topic .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputers .
this country is different from 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
you can predict that . why is that ?
what kind of application am i ?
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
isn &apos;t the half or a quarter of a quarter ? &quot;
so , what can we do from all this ?
so , basically , a translation of translation .
no tree is carbon neutral .
and now , you can see him always .
the next step now has happened within this communities .
he &apos;d uploaded a lot of natural videos .
that &apos;s just the workforce .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
thank you very much for being incredible .
so , it &apos;s here . right .
it really solves the fuel problem .
and ecologist was a disaster .
this is one , part of her .
it just couldn &apos;t be done , you know ?
in other areas -- the world of communication .
this is my supermarket . no big .
but western governments also help themselves .
sleep sleep is ubiquitous .
i &apos;m going to mosquito , like we all .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
if you burn charcoal , no .
tell you , there &apos;s no predictions .
can you play it to me now ?
no , we &apos;re stuck in what &apos;s in .
and there &apos;s a central point in this .
now everyone &apos;s been eating pies .
so , it &apos;s more like the norm than that .
what are the archaic models ?
and the list can be persistent .
so , that was my primary motivation .
devastated america . find more .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we wondered , and no one knew it .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s kind of served us .
and then it looks like this .
do you remember the winds again ?
so , help me a little bit .
imagine mozart that is more efficient .
i &apos;m happy that i &apos;m there .
the water has been much bigger .
they make it worse for us to stand there .
man 3 : i &apos;m the shake guy .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a lip pen .
in between , the instruments have evolved .
i want to quickly explain that for a second .
in fact , no viral video wanted to make viral video .
in this three-sentence , three sentences come in .
three phrases you &apos;re still out of school .
you can zoom in very easily and zoom out .
now i &apos;m going to add a bass .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
if not , equals somebody else today .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
she laughed more than she does it here .
your problem is that you have a little bit of it .
third : escalation of expectation .
the official dogma of what ?
they only start to speak and then speak .
let me show you how they work .
it &apos;s a game called following .
i call them &quot; the next billion . &quot;
we think of energy today .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
you go around and you walk .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
imagine an airplane also full of rings .
that means something that &apos;s built in the city .
second time . at the end of the normal time .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
just imagine that for a moment .
raise your hands . let me see .
maybe we can look at third as a change .
dumb is not much better .
people suffered . people were fighting .
and let them start with an example .
you know that science is not a company .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so , that really blew me out .
i tried to preserve the body .
life had not changed since centuries .
but that &apos;s how many people got over the years .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
my fourth technology : predicting the complexity for complexity .
the third technique : categorization .
it captures thousands of square miles .
you get on two -- very simple .
they should tell me something about my brand .
it was something that we knew to do .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
the summer was a happier summer -- 2006 .
donnery : self-confidence is the key .
they are in the back of our body .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
i wanted to rebuild the health of a disease .
now , if you think a little bit further .
what ? that really made me freak out .
we refuse to regrow from the genetics .
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
we &apos;ve forced them . puff .
my parents are the 80 on the ferm .
and there &apos;s the storm problem .
it &apos;s the most powerful human feature .
we &apos;re talking about the &quot; drowning information . &quot;
you can jump directly to a certain outcome .
you can dive into a particular year .
because this is all done with it , right ?
shaking the environment , consume less energy .
this is the so-called osics model .
now you see the dalbum .
and the two final ones are here today .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
this has to be down at the bottom , down to zero .
i didn &apos;t get away from that , but i didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
and over time , you can react to that .
our goal was to say , okay .
and yes , i &apos;ll go back again .
all of this is compound .
it &apos;s all that &apos;s in the middle , it &apos;s useful .
that will be compared to china in a second .
the phosphorus problem is much critical .
anyway , they &apos;re doing that .
the permanent ice is marked with red .
and if you don &apos;t , dance your dance .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
my mom asked us to touch her hand .
seriously -- the bottom line !
now , this cartoon does some say .
here &apos;s a few on the hampton .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
i thought i could integrate myself .
we still think they were originally enough .
the three words said , do you remember ?
i remember that as if it was yesterday .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
well , i went to the courthouse .
i said , &quot; okay , oma . &quot;
we &apos;re in that transition .
i work in solar technology industry .
and let me show you a simple example .
but it has an unexpected waste .
so that made sense , it would fit together .
and yet , we seem to be completely satisfied .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
scott &apos;s underlying human being .
and here &apos;s each piece of very well planned .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
is it about the details or the colors ?
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
no one needs to have ideas of green light .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
i think maybe i &apos;ve heard more hands .
this would be somebody who &apos;s totally intuitive .
eeee ! no , thank you .
and this is a million-dollar concern .
so at this point , we need digital systems .
so again , the fittest really well .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
we have sexuality in a lot of different forms .
so they &apos;re going to save ; they &apos;re going to save the shoes .
this is about one percent of the population .
we &apos;ve been here for 130,000 years .
what we want to do is create the future .
i &apos;m in preserving this feedback .
there &apos;s a lot of happy coaching .
let me show you it from the point of view .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
damaged mend . described .
we &apos;ve gotten rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
they were just like the people in this room .
my grandparents urged this number 70 .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
we need to be able to do more research for ourselves .
there &apos;s every footprint there .
normally i would take the needle out now .
there &apos;s somebody sitting there who had no childhood .
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we do as if we had a machine here .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
this is going to be a key element of this commodity .
they live with the help of chemosynthesis .
i was totally excited , you know .
now i &apos;m going to choose the subject of government .
and every evening you fly 240 miles away .
every morning , they fly 240 kilometers to the farm .
what is the feed of this ? &quot;
natural light then offers on top of it .
that &apos;s not what nobody did in the world .
picasso goes , wait a minute .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
that the theme of ecology is a global thing .
now i &apos;m going to do something a little bit more powerful .
they &apos;re all back on their way back .
and they had to remove what we did .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we only signed up .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
that &apos;s how they can &apos;t put them together .
what do you do with certificate ?
this is alfred cezz .
there can be a series of changes .
and this is very important in medical research .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
then he whispered me into the ear .
the rest of the time they are occurring .
i start with some simple examples .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask questions .
it &apos;s not a choice between privacy and security .
the question is why people accept that .
and i went back to work .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silicon .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
then i wonder : how could that happen ?
first of all , i thought this was a game .
the storytelling always needs more and more .
and trying to do this again with another generation .
today , a lot of people give the government .
next week , the market comes down to the market .
she &apos;s got a button ; she &apos;s got a button .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
thank you for the behavioral economics .
i mean , no one ever saw a particle .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the performance .
the first one is a classic , apple .
it &apos;s the way i &apos;d like to be .
these are things that have a positive impact .
no one wanted to do something about the film .
what do you think the answer will be ?
on the left , you see a little boat .
so i think we need to be leadership .
so we have this terrible idea .
so two couples , every baby .
ladies and gentlemen , their relatives .
it &apos;s the only test of survival and success .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
it was like , you know , the imagination .
but the best part is -- in a second .
so each concert is a different concert .
so don &apos;t save save saving , avoid .
and everything is packaging or content .
i could park in front of my house . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
supporting others from their mistakes .
i hired them , and i set myself to treatment .
do you know how to call a 400th ?
notice two things about that curve .
and i have to say , there was power .
my mom was the youngest of her kids .
at 16 , i started illustrating books .
that our contribution to the system is to vote .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
he hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
i never want to do something different in life .
so i spoke a few months later at a conference .
so they communicate -- they walk along like that .
i want to show you something here first .
and then , of course , it made climate .
it was summer , and i had a beam .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
and they &apos;re not just going to die of masses .
what happened was we could do that .
they don &apos;t invest time in power .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put it on .
these are absolutely logical and correct .
anyway . that &apos;s what i want to do .
technical circles are just as well .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge to nine .
i was highlighting him here in particular .
in the beginning , the tribal society started by language .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
so she &apos;s supposed to come from the outside of the people .
we don &apos;t invent identity ; we invent it .
it was a lot of los angeles , and i got into iron .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
now everyone &apos;s trying to figure out what this pattern is .
he came to me and hugged me .
everybody who was that way , they started dividing .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you do that crazy ?
the country on the land would roll it up .
so smarter , a huge subject everywhere .
and we want to make this material available to everyone .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
we want to do something about death penalty .
there &apos;s a couple of interesting developments there .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet , a realistic level .
so the theme of the day : financial saving .
in fact , no , that was not the mistake of mistakes at all .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
and we need to do a lot more on this device .
it was created four and a half years ago in italy .
and i would argue that that &apos;s good .
this is a problem that many players have .
the last three of the five has been summed .
let &apos;s see instead , we look at the ecological model .
store this one , trigger the rest .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
well , what is the brand brand ?
i want to help you to calm down .
both of them are overwhelmed , both of them .
as i said , amanda is wearing our elephant .
there was no canopy tales .
have you taken all your vitamin today ?
so this was a highly strange experience .
i can &apos;t do it , but this guy can .
we &apos;ve got 20 percent in germany .
it &apos;s all these wind spots to see virtually .
information is different , and that makes a difference .
the only thing that had , was your head .
so for him , they were just cloning .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
this is a dead turtle .
so i think that this is my brand brand .
i have something i want to show you .
how about living in good health ?
we don &apos;t want companies to be patented .
and that &apos;s what i found in a tremendous way .
they have the flow of the water reverse .
so , we can &apos;t do these things at all .
in the countries where people come from .
and what does it look like because it &apos;s actually out there ?
we understood that the weather is global .
and in this head , the memory was remembering .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is a completely unsustainable pattern of development .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
everyone in my neighborhood is away .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
well , would you choose the same vacation ?
there seems to be a disagreement .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
now they understood the advantage of prototyping .
this is the u.s. for hundreds of years .
i think the first place is curiosity .
the flgos eat the shrimp .
these were the first ever calculations of six years ago .
but maybe you can still agree with them .
but today , we &apos;re only talking about the biological systems .
not all of which to be compound .
if you fall in love with someone , efficient ?
and we see that it goes through .
because it doesn &apos;t feel like we &apos;re making money .
so , yeah , what should be biohacking ?
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
there are the ones that are much more spatial .
the main headquarters is right there .
i thought he would have been a kidney stones .
and then feedback on my top of the doctor .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
we want the number of crops .
the silence is concrete .
the defeat of dna was an interesting step .
people seem to think that politics is sexy .
but what happened to &quot; peace is different .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the label .
no apple ever looked like this .
good night , sweet rats . &quot;
now he &apos;s going to put a tractor in the scene .
and they also feel their movements and their tendency .
if your job is dance , dance .
so we commissioned about 50 of the magnets .
these are records over a long period of six seconds .
but netherlands is not always a bad thing .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
they become rare because we catch them .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of prejudice .
all of these things are inevitable .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
i remember that as though it was yesterday .
and i &apos;m going to get a character in the book .
tell me , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
so each one was a little bit different .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
i put my job at 95 lbs .
so i think the basic systems are very simple .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
we found that it really moves .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
the answer will probably be , &quot; no . &quot;
you know how many people are looking at this tedtalks ?
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
this is something like our camoufi .
so that you can move the whole movement .
here are the results we &apos;ve just got .
but how do you do that in practice ?
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
i don &apos;t want to do it by making a living . &quot;
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
and they ask : what happens to these moments ?
that too , the doses are also playing a role .
now , i think many of you in the room know this trick .
yeah , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
and i &apos;ve got all kinds of little props here .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
well , i understand that . i do that .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
let &apos;s think about how to measure our success .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
these blocks don &apos;t teach us any money .
i can put the sequence as it goes around .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
for nathaniel , music means elite health .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
because , in fact , this man is not interested in prove .
because without these likelihood , we can &apos;t live .
he just tosses them , and not himself .
why do i have to afford that little car ?
a phrase with its own breath .
the interpretation is not talked about in the early class .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
it &apos;s kind of like a pound coat .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
or they didn &apos;t have a photo grape .
and all of this leads to a big question .
it &apos;s virtual reality , and it &apos;s all without computers .
yeah , what are we going to do now ?
and the world that we lived in was that way .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
if you generalize it , that &apos;s what happens .
and this wasn &apos;t too difficult to diagnose .
i was a obsessional student .
well , really good , maybe a star star .
wealth , not the debt , the outcome .
she had the last word in any family argument .
the transition is overwhelming . we can all feel it .
and we use this word with such scores .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and that worked . applause for scott .
i met the decision to go to the united states .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
and this was an experience in humility for me .
and finally , we should be transparency .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
or are you a downhill trite ?
what is the next thing you want to talk about .
so what are we going to see in the film ?
you know , i had the idea for a film .
i want to tell you how we found that .
and this is the planning behind stuximum .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
how could it be that we do this ?
you see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
it &apos;s natasha , and it &apos;s just natasha .
we have the passion of a diy innovators .
this is moore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
we want to create mass customization . &quot;
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
now we do this with drilling and machines .
this is the call center for service and information .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
we have all the navigation systems in our cars .
but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
all right , let me show you a little bit more of it .
here we were , and this is the painting .
emc everywhere , they &apos;re called transparency welcome .
there were a lot of crazy things going on .
from the bird age to the machine age .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same with the disabled movement .
but are we going to make the best part of our game ?
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
so we have 1.5 billion players around this .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
but one of them is worse than the other .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
i thought we &apos;re going to use pottery .
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
and then i met a little bit of an unusual decision .
so , my two passions flew out .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
i had a very different relationship with this beauty .
i don &apos;t know who knows this picture .
i first agree that &apos;s logical .
it seems to me that it seems to be both .
the question of death penalty is an interesting question .
the kid in me is really thrilled .
so , there &apos;s a nice little game dynamics .
al is a hydrant in boston .
today i &apos;m going to report by unexpected discoveries .
the underwater part comes from a stone breakup .
when i say reality , i mean photo-realization .
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
and how was that for her ? what did it succeed ?
a little bit more about you , that &apos;s not you .
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
service : adapting your mind is totally overwhelmed .
the dog ! i was out there .
would you like to be more attractive and more confident ?
she didn &apos;t breathe , and she was blue .
people are in the side rooms right now .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and some of it worked out , and some of it didn &apos;t work .
so we run away , and where are we going ?
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
we wanted to develop a learning tool for speech .
i may have served another 40 years in me .
you know what the answer to this question is ?
if you want to make hyperlinks between the images .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not taken up as a great loss .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
this is the kind of educational ridge .
now , unfortunately , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies .
and we &apos;re learning and play the rules of play .
probably one of these numbers has to get very close to zero .
and i said , &quot; yes , very much . &quot;
you can say things that have the world &apos;s influence .
... could you please show the slide for a second .
equally , i think , we &apos;re going to play a game today .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the aid doctor .
and i went over , and i just stopped .
it also shows up to other places of the book .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
another favorite picture of me , star , night .
these results have been achieved by several weeks of hard work .
this player is about to be victory in front of an episode .
why do i do that ? what comes out there ? &quot;
there &apos;s a program that maybe some of you know .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
you know , he was 35 in 1835 .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of this .
my mother litt suffered from the boat .
these are the people who shape my world view .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the border .
we see that in all sorts of areas of human life .
and it was just like three months .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent .
the main problem here is something like aids .
the logic doesn &apos;t say anything about reality .
have a nice concrete example .
then i say , heart rate , yeah ?
and we often reinvent ourselves as much as we want .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
his whole business process has changed after that .
i said , &quot; promises , oma . &quot;
it &apos;s kind of spoken and strange programs .
the politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
but what this picture is , what this picture is , is a problem .
there are some places that we can turn to .
we called it the digital water palion .
because they have special skills of processing .
so here are some natural fireflies .
the second factor is the services that we use .
it changed my way to make movies , completely .
it &apos;s hard to overcome the destruction .
so you could feel comfortable selling it .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
that is , the ants weigh much more than we do .
and we can look at that now .
gee and jellyfish cows .
so , go ahead and start to invent them .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
this is an idea worth spreading .
imagine just two other small changes .
how many would choose to decide a good memory ?
and that &apos;s what the bike is .
so please stop playing a music .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what it is .
the first two sentences , they are logically correct .
in fact , we know that something else is the case .
now this should actually be a joke , but it should be .
if you do that , and then you experience the sentence .
we can do these things in different ways .
what we love about us is that it &apos;s the first place .
they moved to a natural concept of science .
so these women met , and they just signed up .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and we &apos;ve created a cardboard app .
daring and sponsors have been sponsored .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzles .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you zoom in . you can go really into it .
you can see in all these museums .
how much money is needed to realize that ?
think about it . this attack is generic .
and if it doesn &apos;t , it doesn &apos;t matter .
so we &apos;re starting with a windowless drug .
he says , &quot; making a pronounce of sound . &quot;
imagine a sound lowering airplane .
it &apos;s a completely denial of errors .
the first one is that we &apos;re not going to grow .
this is another view of life on the tree of life .
they divided the kingdom into two .
this is one of the classical expressions in playing .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
we didn &apos;t have a child in this country yesterday .
and i took a while to find that .
we repeated these practice with the same students .
you have to be willing to take risks like that .
&quot; look at your belly , pink .
there &apos;s no transmitter problem with trees .
then you &apos;ll notice that it has been a change .
and the third area , which actually explains itself .
i look forward to the conversations of all of you .
each big picture is the beginning of a cutting-edge .
you would not like to starve , and you know what ?
or are you more like a downtown trite ?
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
that &apos;s the consequence that we need to hire .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
we don &apos;t want iran to build bomb .
i said , &quot; please fly in the air . &quot;
you can move inside and do different kinds of experiences .
wednesday : surrounded your inner child .
play is the tickling that keeps us up .
if you have something to give it , you have it now .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
they teach them how to open themselves .
antarctica : healthy , powerful , powerful . &quot;
and here are two patients . these are their records .
i mean , this is a real cognitive one .
i think that &apos;s true of every person on the planet .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
so , a climate change is going to be terrible for you .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as designers .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
but the volume is far bigger than ever before .
it grows in winter and shrinks in summer .
not just bad , but the worst ever of all time .
everyone knew your genius was a little bit lam .
we repaired them , repairs them .
and the world in which we now look like this .
but these are all roads in the u.s. .
we dance at the temple and we become god . &quot;
child mortality has a tenth of a tenth .
that &apos;s where it comes from . it comes back .
right ? something that &apos;s a half a billion people eat .
she &apos;s not even an idea ; she &apos;s a process .
and you know what the answer to all this is ?
we walk into the poor business .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
where is the biggest interest , what is this really going on ?
furthermore , the energy source is very important .
we went back to the wreck of titanic .
because artists have a degraded relationship to the lie .
and at all , you know , much less than i am .
or because they didn &apos;t learn how to sing ?
i &apos;m never going to play the way in this moment .
it &apos;s a reform of refour-way behavior , yeah ?
and less usable or user-friendly , it is .
how can i make a little bit more friendly ?
i don &apos;t see why this shouldn &apos;t be that way .
so how do we work when we look in there ?
each society is shaped by a primary medium .
and these interactive portraits are coming up with each other .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation .
you may have heard that we have built watermarks .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
you get a model that comes out of the whole earth .
the grandfather of this old man refused to .
and she said the three words : do you remember you ?
the only problem with this was that she had 10 children .
so in other words , i want to do what i want .
and i see the same process in combination of photos .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it &apos;s been looked almost 200 million times a year .
they had 348 different types of marinade .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with that .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember that .
he described one of them as &quot; usually &quot; . &quot;
it was developed at the university of washington washington in seattle .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
in a place , the screen is filled with leaves .
so the pywhale movement has done it .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
this year , it &apos;s been looked almost 50 million times .
but what about this day , this particular day ?
i want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
we should put the bear in the cage .
are they astounding and monthly like seven ?
the living self has no voice in that choice .
they lie in the united states , in europe and japan .
and in the world , everything made sense to me .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
daniel , in a moment of headrest .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
so gender can occur in a lot of different ways .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
and no , it &apos;s not a good one or san francisco .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open up them ?
here is the current version of this one-on-one .
it was a extreme situation . you needed a extreme solution .
and this was sort of the first of people to play toys .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
they never get a task that they can &apos;t solve .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen so rare lines .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
and the film is called &quot; the abundance . &quot;
well , in this area , there are not a couple of thousands of goals .
we &apos;re talking about 15,000 lines here .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
well , we &apos;ve launched the mayor hole .
now , today , we know all about where we come from .
france makes a gate . italy makes a gate .
how do you pride people because of their character ?
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressive .
he picks up five pounds of hope from my consciousness .
is it possible for others , or is it affecting us ?
so i say , let &apos;s start with changing the world .
edward caova is a national scientist .
now , we spend three billion hours a week playing online video games .
the biggest difference between them is the transition time .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
bg : energy is the most important thing .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t make you yourself .
with pivot , you can dive into a decade .
but for a lot of people , that &apos;s a little too radical .
so i went to my life a lot of fish .
i understood that this is exactly the nature of art .
in fact , the grades are very vague and exactly .
because we don &apos;t do things anymore .
it &apos;s going to be more like a glasses of my glasses .
as i said , it just started out .
this is an interactive filtration .
and skoll ! in spite of that .
i &apos;m going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and everyone knew it worked like this , right ?
i &apos;d rather keep doing this work that i love .
and the question is , is that good news or bad news ?
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
here &apos;s what it says : &quot; put your finger on every light . &quot;
the next step was to find the apps for it .
we still know one where all the stations are .
so you &apos;re just going to go to google projects .
what other metamorbell do you have ?
so we don &apos;t have such a budget like other brands .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money trying to look great .
this constant feedback is not true in real life .
i &apos;m going to explain it for you and then explain it .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
a research mester : the theme of user interface
i &apos;m also going to resolve the same thing , which is there .
you don &apos;t know anything about this goldfish glass . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great dunes .
in the future , most crimes will play online .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
now it &apos;s on the red list of endangered species .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
but i really think that after us , something is coming .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of these communities .
the cell communities started to abstract information again .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
this is great . this is the digital thing .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the rat .
&quot; don &apos;t go &quot; caught &quot; as untrue .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the brick .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s being put together .
also urban designer and farmer are very interested .
it &apos;s not even online . it &apos;s not a stretch .
so it doesn &apos;t work for the memory itself .
our steps at the digitization of life were exponential .
the star is ennight , probably never seen that before .
over the course of this discovery , i learned a lot .
as a kid , i drew comic books and so on .
when we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
right now , this is largely our goal .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i &apos;m not always the same .
we were there just as much as we were .
a lot of talk from a 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
i was quite obsessed with investigating the deep sea .
so when it comes out , there &apos;s no soul .
this is the most difficult part of my talk .
i can &apos;t play like today in 20 years .
they were both given to me , they were sitting on me .
so much testosterone , but no reaction to that .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
i &apos;m just going to hold that knife in my head .
1foot is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the end of the day ?
that &apos;s why the onion is how we think .
these are spaces that can respond to people .
now , how do people die in such a shark ?
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and you can see this green point there in the middle .
i sold animals all over the world , worldwide .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can turn that around .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio did not know that .
no , that &apos;s exactly the right thing , yes ?
many of you are covered in faces .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
in both cases , operated operations and they were doing a good job .
she didn &apos;t have a brain damage .
ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
and the fish also had the luck to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the numbers of language .
it was the eradicated drug against drugs .
this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
there &apos;s more of it behind , and it &apos;s even deeper .
but we just know a little bit about where things go .
ok , imagine how extreme self-motivation is .
i know what people think when they see that .
ask , ask , ask evidence , ask them .
i said , &quot; chicken eggs ? &quot;
everything in life is beautiful , not efficient .
it used to be the same way that it happened in the village .
this is what happened to be the genetic machine age .
in fact , there is a political statement in our country .
she loves them to the atrian machine .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental copy .
she could find within a time-lapse learning framework .
... it &apos;s the crowdsourcing observation .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
i &apos;ve been working in a coal mine -- dangerous .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
and there &apos;s rumble , and he said , &quot; that ? &quot;
that means going back to the crime .
so , like a human being with certain kinds of things .
and of course , how design takes influence to perception .
but it &apos;s a disaster for the lower two billion .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambition .
lawyer : i &apos;m a lawyer .
we have a abstract language .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
but actually , it was in this night a bigger one .
we had to deal with the lawyers .
it was called &quot; automatically . &quot;
inflection is a certified place .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to do ?
he took a famous picture . what was it like ?
it slows down for one of our big problems .
we see the process that feeds itself .
rats ? yes . alive ? y.
here &apos;s a short video of what we do .
but you can combine something as special as that .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
because the images are making it recommend for them .
and , you know , you &apos;re in the museum .
the idea is to translate a digital system .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and that &apos;s actually one conservative estimates .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain it .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
in fact , the advanced society is continuing to progress .
this wasn &apos;t a film , no hd , that was real .
i wasn &apos;t there for a long time ago .
because you know , this is a fun process .
have you ever seen a clineutral tree ?
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i described .
if you want to come far , go , go together . &quot;
america &apos;s new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
frogs , the carbon will be cleverer every day .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
so i go back and see the other way .
i filmed in war areas -- difficult and dangerous .
so we should get better at figuring out what the goal is .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
when we make cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
when the kid is born , she looks like a girl .
in other words , play is our adaptive joker .
can you imagine something good coming out of the tablet ?
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds of their pain .
you can just call a few names and people will understand .
diphthalates , tubes , child paralysis ...
this is a variant of one thing that was done .
well , the energy episode about time .
and it was an experience that couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
it caused immense jugglers in the control room .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s this precise , cocative taste .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
and so he gives his elderly assigned circumstances .
and then there &apos;s a lot of simulations about simulations .
but it wasn &apos;t that common in the azier years .
the musical child is the extension of our bodies .
he lived only for three years .
hey , puma , does it really mean you &apos;re serious ?
a baby needs about a sixth wind .
so i know some of the ones that have not been embedded .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people in the world .
it &apos;s going to be gone from here to here for 25 years .
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
please follow me , because the circle will end again .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
this is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
she gets to thabo mbeki in south africa .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face it .
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds of them .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
i have a friend who drives a passage .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound .
and because we get older , the wind gets bigger .
this is the time period in which you fell in love .
and today we &apos;re still very , very strong stories .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and the predictions of how you read them are serious .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
and i didn &apos;t expect it to change .
it &apos;s also my big , life-long and fascination .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
why do they advertise if we can &apos;t buy ?
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
a few years ago , i started developing littings .
the shells of broader still describe them as untouched .
my grandfather was in prohibition during prohibition .
she was a gun , strong woman , she had effect .
so , in a way , mapping the technology .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
but what if you want to see the paintbrush ?
but my logical side has not liked .
i just want to say a little bit about saldressing address .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . heart good .
we also brought littlettes to design schools .
this is the simulation of the esapeake bay .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to deal with injustice .
my uncle died of alcohol diseases .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
in fact , we are such a majority of the community .
what is this new condition that takes the world slowly ?
let &apos;s call the animal kingdom , it costs a lot of money .
if a neighbor helps the other , we strengthen our communities .
ohhhhh , wowwwww !
they always worry that they lose galvanic .
50 percent of their decisions have been hit by nine minutes or less .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and my talk today is mainly made by these cognitive bias .
well , sometimes i play with them , but not very often .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called the collector .
open the map , and jump with a click .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a whole lot about transparency .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
you could also use ordinary design -- technology to spread .
one of my friends did it -- richard bollingo .
imagine if they could really start flying these points .
i smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
these are the kinds of questions we need to be encountered .
i was fascinated by the election and beauty of biology .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
and that &apos;s a economist . so he &apos;s logical .
i mean , how much toe do we memorize our memories ?
the more money you deserve , the more you feel .
that our survive with the survival of every single one of them is connected .
10 minutes later , the judge announced a break .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
and yeah , i have a task , as you might recognize .
secondly , secondly , make photos the same kind of utility .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
for example , this one would be completely logical .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be done .
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing on the movie of statements .
and the film is called &quot; the abundance . &quot;
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
it &apos;s just that i think it &apos;s more like him , not true .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy it . thank you very much .
but it turned out that it &apos;s not all .
i mean , let &apos;s say , why are we fighting this ?
that &apos;s a lot of tomasses , 20 per hour .
so there should be a nine to my death at the beginning of death .
because they are the people who are also experts for taste .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
i mentioned that in miguel and he was taking nights .
so the paintings of the trees , the better the system . &quot;
and then i immediately think that &apos;s unfair .
and also , what you would think about today in the mind .
and that oil will replace us with other energy tears .
i &apos;m not good enough ; i don &apos;t make it .
like algae -- and other terrible things .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
it was completely exclusive that it could fail .
so that &apos;s what got me right , and i wanted to do more .
and immediately i see another pattern that &apos;s recovered .
yeah , this is the bottom there . it &apos;s the load .
it &apos;s not resource efficiency , it &apos;s effects .
we &apos;ve been working on holland now for three years .
and if possible , i will find some of the weird things .
i know now that it was the reason of the sea .
and that was the first time i learned this .
i examined a woman , and she was in breathing .
and the time i collected more and more .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a bucket is 300 .
in 2010 , we had just been connected under two billion people online .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
and the lighting path through the book of the book .
&quot; because she had been holding this morning , &quot; he said .
we have the capital of the techno-philanthropy .
this approach for everything that we do is creative .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone in this audience .
now , your living self will not be happier .
and the answer is really simple . it &apos;s always lost .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
here &apos;s a picture of a kentucky .
he has a featurization of 15 .
i can say the canary is a man .
we &apos;ve been in the case of what we &apos;ve been doing before .
this is equivalent to 20 sea level , the size of greenland .
this is the incentive that we just recently finished .
somewhere here is a series of photographs -- here they are .
but you can , if you &apos;re in a foreign place .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t seem to be more human .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
or would you like to be more powerful , more power .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though that belongs .
my great-grandparents died all when they were 60 .
well , where should we go : what is the right approach ?
it &apos;s kind of like you &apos;re all in the suburbs .
and of course , you can never give it to germany . &quot;
one government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be efficient .
and the more i spoke , the more i should tell .
and i celebrate , i cry like a little kid .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit into my tiny suitcase .
when you &apos;re happy , you attract other happy people .
players are masters in denser social networks .
how can we translate these feelings into reality ?
so , the same way , the bad team of one is under the best .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worry .
so , people in the west have really thought about creativity .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
a consequence of that was that the phone was never broken .
we can predict the structure of his behavior , and function .
a few months off , and i just had forgotten everything .
even who kills somebody is not just a killer .
the invention of language was a little step in that direction .
and the next interesting phase took about a billion years .
and this video was actually already ended up in january .
each one of these subjects , of course , were making a lot of small decisions .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing the time .
today i want to tell you about circles and apparatus .
they interact with their environment and their experiences .
that trick can lead your friends and neighbors . thank you .
you know , there was no mandarin in in the parades .
yes , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
one of the things that life is beautiful is not efficient .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting is the vision of vision .
i apologize to myself that i have to disseminate .
second , what economists call the persistence east .
and i think it &apos;s kind of worried that the world looks like this .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
so it has nothing changed , and yet everything has changed .
we &apos;ve just crossed the 7-billion-one brand .
and then , let &apos;s have this analogy in the future .
so , if you can do the light again .
it was a store that was called dragger .
are you so far ? you see a little nervous .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
the things that are used only are going to be used in technical systems .
so that &apos;s the device you see there that doesn &apos;t work .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean coal technology .
they did that by serving the country .
bryan stevenson : well , there are possibilities everywhere .
be afraid of welcome . listen to the risk of welcome .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
there are only the second best , the fire department .
they can throw away , where they are and they are .
one amazing miserable . one of the nine innocent unguilty .
i want to give you two , maybe three examples too .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually going to become a roller polar ice .
this is somebody who &apos;s safe from the rest of them 10 .
we &apos;ve taught ourselves that things happen .
i had a 14-year-old , poor young black men as mandela .
they &apos;re in there , they want to end up until the end of the gangs .
and then the people could eat this and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
because this is where the actual government is taking place .
&quot; 2,five , what ? what do you do ? &quot;
and then we started negotiating with insulation .
the conventional system all over the world looks like this .
i play explaining what these notes could mean .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re helping them with questions , they &apos;re asking for the people .
but also , our perception , how do you disagree with us ?
and another example is the ambient systems , intelligent systems .
how many doors have the house where they live ?
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s still good .
i believe in it , and i feel like we should teach .
and i guess that many of you have done that too .
some people were disappointed that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
i sent them home without talking to my doctor .
the cost of solar power in the last year was 50 percent .
we need to focus on the machinery of government .
there &apos;s a direct return system for this .
the monkey &apos;s software takes on a couple of years .
and sure enough , we can find fast food chain .
cats look at cats that look at this video .
well , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
and what happened is that i needed a experts .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned language .
i just wish i could see my children grow up .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
it has moments of life , one after the other .
and i agreed to fund a expedition .
we talk about the flight of information overseas .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineer .
well , that &apos;s the first year of his advertising .
well , how do you start to speak the language of music ?
so they go around and create art installations like this .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
i was shocked , and i was crushed into the inside of it .
i went through the emergency department of my way home .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
i say that because i believe identity is very important .
because all these new technologies are coming from today .
because your life depended on whether you did the job .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
i knew she had come to give herself .
today , we don &apos;t just find the gene of something we do with it .
a typical wal-mart offers you today 100,000 products .
you know how many choices do you make in a typical week ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical page says .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is what is truly awesome .
for example , the previous example , it was about finding units .
he said he wasn &apos;t going to ask . he &apos;s going to ask questions .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with you .
if it wasn &apos;t moving anymore , it &apos;s buried .
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
again , what potential do we want to call ?
i think we &apos;re ready to play for our own game .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
if we looked at what feelings do with income .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
there was no christmas trees . we did it all .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is it .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
look at rubber , farmers like miguel .
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals ?
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not so sure .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
the words , as long as his friends , have now been released .
and we found that in fact , there was a correlation .
you know how many choices do you make on a typical day ?
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
so the driving force is behind cyber , superpower .
i didn &apos;t spend two years on my wife .
the pilot set up the machine after the hudson river .
the revelation is , the death is part of life .
it keeps us with the distance and leaves us all the time .
but there was always a life cycle in her presentations .
he &apos;s about 120 feet off the water , or 40 meters .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
you see the person who &apos;s wondering what &apos;s going on inside .
most of my activities , i &apos;ve got two chicks on my own .
it turns out that dna synthetic is very difficult .
we know that money is very important , goals is very important .
we think about our future as a pronounced memory .
well , the reminder itself is a storyteller .
what it ruined was the memories of the experience .
we &apos;re going to go to the next few days .
there &apos;s a steady increase there .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable ile structure .
a fish up , but also a bird &apos;s reserve .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love story .
this first one , this was more like a passionate monkey .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s deceived it .
because the music is a language , and it &apos;s a language to communicate .
and , above all , to ask questions , what is the right thing .
but so far , i &apos;ll do it just a little bit more curious .
i started thinking , i should just put the project in there .
we can , of course , hide the problem of garbage .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take you away .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
just to make precise points of time , they agree .
if the museum has given us the picture , you click on it .
so you can ask : how happy is that alive ?
most of you are completely ignored by the memory itself .
please don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
does a single person in the audience ever see someone die of masses ?
it &apos;s the question of whether you can get it to zero .
you can test it after my talk in your immune system .
but of course , it &apos;s the sum very , very different ideas .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
so , in every store , you can get things back .
so the question is , how do we deal with these wind ?
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
so , for example , shaking the environment , less car .
and the lives lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
so if i put them together , that &apos;s what their interest is .
do i think of that as a song , i could write a song ?
she said it would be like a donnist from the air .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
they put a blue on a green one , and they can make light .
but they &apos;re not going to take the preventive losses .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition goes very quickly .
and yet , we still get to the galvanian islands .
more and more people came , just because they were angry .
it was the fear of terror that had your life .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
we have a lot of cells that are no longer involved alone .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
but where would the next scientist be to help this patient ?
they have to make 62 different decisions to design their car .
well , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t that easy .
almost as if we were to prepare our lives for it .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego room .
i was the only one who could talk to the airplanes .
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
think of this as a dot , as a flying point .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
this is a fascinating adventure that you go to .
this is going to affect politics , i think , in the coming years .
we found that in terms of happiness .
they evaluate their urine . they almost never do them .
usually most people start to orient themselves .
you have to introduce the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
and interestingly , bono is also a prize winner .
if you walk , yeah , everyone destroys the footprint .
if we overrun it , we can go back a little bit .
the most powerful miners are the head of mask .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe this is a kind of artificial , a book .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to get worse .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
because from marine protected areas , we &apos;re basically returning to the past .
i want to end with a story that really was really excited to me .
sometimes i lose the balance . a story to end .
i found that technology should be able to do magic and not kill .
so now we &apos;ve been restraining the time scale .
so today evolution can happen in time from microseconds .
here he lifts a rare poem .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
we could reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i &apos;m probably not going to be able to take all of you on this journey .
he said , &quot; well , in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
automobiles , color of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
they &apos;re not even coming out of the lakes .
so , you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
i really like your way , sergey brin .
i became the miracle part of this day not going to die .
it &apos;s called eyebrow , and you can see the description .
this is the average size of a greenland iceberg .
i mean , what does anybody do with so many outcomes ?
and as a general term , we can use the word sexuality .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think we can .
we all have to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
let &apos;s call him guel . in fact , he &apos;s miguel .
because he doesn &apos;t know which pile is supposed to go first .
then the same thing happens in a good job , started talking .
i have to tell you : i think that was a big mistake .
we take pictures of this mini-big bang in detectors .
economists call this a parallel improvement .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what enables us to do .
the path to maximize is to maximize .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
this is a whole book , an example of nonverbal data .
and of course , we all share the same adaptation .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in the case of inflection .
there are cases of , as the inflection of inflection .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
innovation , creativity and development is not just from our heads .
i want to help you with a very specific aspect of curiosity .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
ceo : something about average . but here &apos;s going to be interesting .
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
here &apos;s one of the evidence of the evidence that men are not pigs .
this deputy ran over the elderly black men .
i don &apos;t know how receiving people are going to be .
you go around the block , and it &apos;s like revelation .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the room .
bonobos are combined with chimpanzees .
the first of these is a contradiction of complexity .
they invest a lot of their time in the reconstruction of the structure of the structure .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy how little that &apos;s going to be supported .
you &apos;re usually just dangers and some , some people don &apos;t .
now , he mentioned the minerals of physical plankton .
i take the breath of the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
they feel that this is the actual truth behind it .
but the question i want to throw up is : why not ?
and the best part is , perhaps , what is expected in health .
this is technology support innovation that is there today .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so difficult , so painful .
who want to help people who have been convicted of innocent .
and that means free , that means open and productive .
how did he come to look for this particular way of looking for help ?
let &apos;s jump back to moma , back in new york .
tempt is going to be part of the show , which is pretty drift .
we produce androgen and we talk to androan .
and when you do it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this is scandalous , and we should be ashamed .
and this is the value of this experience , this kind of simple practice .
but as you &apos;re talking to different people in this world about these possibilities .
today , the renewables have a renewable energy of five percent .
and they &apos;ve done this with so-called lead-maps .
but critically , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so , i &apos;ve been busy looking at what is , of course , or what &apos;s intuitive .
and these are just the biohacker , the individual people .
it means that we have a cultural influence beside the scientific method .
this made me feel like i wanted to do my jeans .
he invited the king of sideways to the dinner .
but somehow , we create it from this problem .
and that &apos;s what i had last year .
but instead of making panic , he just stopped .
how about tears that we can &apos;t even predict ?
if you look at the people they have to do with .
and guess what we found in the attack of attack ?
imagine that every single person will be controlled by people .
okay , so let me put a little blood on you .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
new investments to create good jobs .
six is more social case . 7 : 65 dead .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with me these kinds of things and play .
that means that the player is going to beat 10 strokes by 10 .
a long time ago , there was gray -- 500 years ago .
in many of them , they will say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
the x-ray interpretation of a piece of it is this unimaginable .
from my eye angle , i saw the janitors going up and down .
i always found fireflies in a glass of jellyfish .
this image , for example , has about 10 billion points , i think .
so i decided , when i was 15 , i was dive .
this is a bigger one . we &apos;re going to look right here at the center .
and within a few years , lego dropped in every household .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
i didn &apos;t actually learn that in my work as a lawyer .
and i want to show you my outfits for this week .
56 percent of all rape cases do not come to court .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely new .
i asked him how he became such a fish experts .
there was the core research engineer opolar shadows .
from that time , an anecdote that you may know .
it doesn &apos;t need to be used to whistle or whistle .
and sixty-10 milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that goes way back to the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
so , i think it &apos;s a very yellow hack .
i think , sort of , sort of like the blessing of it or something like that .
this actually has only twice a thousand thousand really accepted shape , these networks .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
so , this looks like a basketball billboard .
and if we can do that , can we launch the chromosome ?
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t go down .
now , in fact , the number of nonviolence doesn &apos;t change very much .
i eaten him first in a southern spain .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity .
it &apos;s always been so inspiring , so it &apos;s cheating .
the death penalty in america defined by the iranium .
turned the trash on the side . went home .
so that airport has a surface of 100 square kilometers .
i like things that are special . i like special things .
that &apos;s my brand in my little , distorted industry .
so maybe you should put a little bit on the interview of this . &quot;
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine leaders .
here you see an excerpt from this attack -- seller code .
we have beaten up his bed so that he can see outside .
we degrade a man who has value for our society .
we put a games in order to get the suffering of the real world .
we hate government . we don &apos;t have trust the system .
what about child survival ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
it &apos;s also very clear that the answer is the question : it &apos;s .
the secret is that the game of the key to this skills is .
this is actually the real melting of man and machine .
some . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
it produces the highest construction in the least time .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of tons of sound on the planet .
i grew up with a cave comprehensive science fiction .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building something called siv , not intense .
so here was finally a company trying to do it right .
the compound is always going to be a friend who lives with .
and i &apos;m not sure if you really stay with me .
the interesting thing is , if i can make a little flight of it .
and i thought , well , there was a really good code .
in fact , nasa showed that there are many of them out there .
they like to increase the paralysis and the satisfaction .
now , i wondered , how can i really get this over ?
it &apos;s an independent area . you control all the minerals .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical vision .
somebody was suspended and had founded the system of hair .
photographs like this : a construction spot along a lot of vehicles .
the biggest fear they were afraid of piratory , rape and death .
so it turns out it &apos;s very difficult to get all these extensions .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange street .
but this time , it &apos;s a very good meditation .
i brought seven of these hoses , and this is all .
but a lot of people get caught in a very strange position .
our gut is a wonderfully friendly friendly environment for these bacteria .
well , the two species of self throw out two terms of happiness .
well , the living self lives his continuously .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of luck among research .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mimies .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
ah , the majority . i like to see that as a doctor .
my inspiration comes from a event that is 2,500 years back .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
now , what does that have to do with the placebo effect ?
the smallpox . the smallpox people were killed on this planet .
it &apos;s the renewable energy , as they are often called .
that &apos;s a fishery on the south corner of the western spain .
since i ask how expertise was this diagnosis ?
the notites have the function of the letters of a writing .
then , the laser reference to the pre-industrial cultures .
that is , you navigate about sound and rhythm .
so that &apos;s just one application of a lot that you can do with it .
and then we &apos;ve done this kind of cosmic process .
on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to lhc .
should i write on this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
this is what we call in our lab , our perceptual design .
54 percent of deaths went through drilling .
essentially , the concrete building had become the construction of our time .
how about a new , never before more voices .
how can a judge turn someone into something he isn &apos;t ?
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lyndon mobs .
so , programs that are most likely to be able to animals .
for example , the fish had been recorded on a shell .
the possibilities that weren &apos;t allowed , were exclusively encouraged .
so , a couple of years ago , i was doing this .
finally , in advance , we should welcome the fear of welcome .
an eight-legged brand , marke . how is your brand ?
why is it important to restart neutral ? what is that red ?
so we &apos;ve created a device which is completely free of constraints .
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
well , at that night , everyone went to the center to celebrate .
and the critical indicator of this is the extinction of the languages .
and i had to explain to the journalists that there &apos;s not that test .
and this is called androgen-receptor defect .
we &apos;re developing thinking of community-adopted , heart creatures .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to investigate as a graduate student .
right now , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
and soon , i wrote a paper about genetic food .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
so i offered a 100,000 dollars of software for winning .
one day , this mirror , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
there was no piano at all .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
even if you were to shoot yourself now , you would have emissions .
most of you know , most people know this from the software industry .
this is actually live on the internet now . you can check it out .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nunavind .
but nothing was invented , that would leave me back , until now .
and the best part about this is that they connect with magnets .
some of my stupid passions happened in the last five years .
i looked in the raffes , and it was a little bit of a pink .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular tonight .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
that &apos;s why the dramatic numbers are going to pay attention to the prison .
i &apos;ve given some talks to germany about death penalty .
a child in india says , &quot; today i saw a monkey . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know much about government , when i started this program .
this is my lander . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
what are the relationship to the thoughts and feelings of themselves ?
and if the people are dangerous , then really bad things can happen .
and this urgency , this goal , has changed my life .
they &apos;re talking about nature &apos;s power to tell us who we are .
if we don &apos;t do any phosphorus and abandoned it .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most magical thing for me .
but for youtube , more than 48 hours per video is uploaded .
if they could do it for them , they would help me .
and just disappeared all of these companies , one after the other .
i &apos;m sad that we never know each other as adults .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserve .
so , if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
and that &apos;s why , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individual .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individual .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go to the house .
if you only have one of those , it would be a completely different world .
specialized skills and processing skills and their combination of success .
people here have contributed to the evolution of many of these miracles .
and somehow , we need to bring changes that are going to fall down to zero .
we find other strings of what their rights are .
that &apos;s the headline of most perceptions that we have .
this is our youngest taster right down there .
by the end of march , the lhc is going to be functional again .
and this is the news i took in medical school .
you know how to call a 3,000-pound league of baseball ?
i believe that in many places , the opposite of poverty is .
if somebody lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
and so i think the ted community should be horse .
and she &apos;s spreading out , organic , of course .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say , ted .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
well , finally , the film has got a very big deal to get it .
this is actually just a period of two to three weeks .
these people will be connected to the film in eternity -- forever .
so all these green areas , these are the richest environments .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; sousing . &quot;
so unfortunately , we have a piece of god that is too far too distant .
i got to the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
in the short time here , i realized one : ted has a identity .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good intuition to actually do experiments .
in my view , mass incarceration changed our world .
this is all reality today , and in the future , it will be much more possible .
so that allows us to build the together of binary , trust and interact with each other .
here &apos;s what it says , the more you go around , the better .
people said , do you have no fear to succeed ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding me , but i can live with it .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely impossible .
i love this one : &quot; watson &quot; contains human enemies . &quot;
i looked at her and i smiled , but she looked very seriously .
three months later , i moved around , and the adventure went on .
it &apos;s about creating from scarf goods .
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gray matter , and a stuff like that .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
that &apos;s what we want to do as a possible impulse to use the flyfish .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology to it ?
i don &apos;t want to give you the same rights as a human being .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very quickly .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s catholic concert .
the man is supposed to have a common ancestor a common ancestor .
and loud and light , f and b , etc .
how were his living circumstances , how the society and the politics ?
on september 10 , september of september , the machine went to the first time .
we have littletted to kids , and we see them playing with it .
and when i heard her , she made keener sounds .
and i was good , i went off with claude .
but if i ask you , how do you do it with your wife ?
you collectively collect information about the piece in the sewex literature .
there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they can all be engaged .
but how about the image that you lined with all your images ?
you say you never forget the names of the names .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other government technology .
because the categories are telling me how to stop them .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
we should be able to plot everything we want .
and i tend to look at vienna as my shadow .
it was done in a way to see if that was true .
there you go , which is enormous speed of speed there .
the forces come from asia , where all the japan is from .
because a good engineer has either great cars or nuclear power plants .
this was the very first beginning of a musical expression .
you can only have numerical missions when they &apos;re not there .
you &apos;re fine . the question is , how will it get us ?
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
the official belief in all the western industrialized societies .
&quot; do you remember the patient you went home ? &quot;
we live on a planet , which is 70 percent covered with water .
but they just take the housing of inhabitants to the cities .
because that &apos;s how you can use this logic to be wrong .
often the music education class is that you learn to read the notes .
that &apos;s just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
eight : tsunamidal warren , cyberattacks , attacks .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
bruno gusani : mark , mark , come back .
now , when it &apos;s hardly appropriate , perhaps the most important thing is that .

and that &apos;s going to be worse , and pretty soon children are going to die again , because that &apos;s just one of the numbers .
in the rich world , the millions of us have only threatened one generation , hardly .
here we see a very fundamental service . there &apos;s a light at home so that you can read the homework ?
the greeks called these divine mental illness of creativity .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch the next century as it &apos;s being taken into the next century .
and what we do is we install an evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going on in the microyearning area .
so in other words , the future is all around a year since i &apos;ve been on this world .
they &apos;re shooting the decision -- they &apos;re shooting on their own , even if they &apos;re interested in their own self-interest .
so these kinds of things -- you know , people reminds you -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
if you surround yourself with the right people , you will not only understand it , you will also appreciate it .
i talked to the oil industry recently , and they said that they were doing this model right .
one way , which is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve spent a lot of time in a very often , is evolution itself .
we last year had a team of lovin boston in boston that said , &quot; code program . &quot;
so , imagine you &apos;d be at the same time at the same time , how would that feel ?
it &apos;s obvious that it &apos;s very simple , but it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
so the nerve cells are the information processing seasons , which have built these cell communities .

so for this non-engineers , littlettle-shaped a material , another electronics was just another material .
so , what can be three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the community take us ?
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is indian but also very time-consuming .
and every time it divided , the finds in that have been expanding chemicals in the same way .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a realistic result .
so i wanted to create something different , something that starts out in the process , when the trigger is placed .
and if you take a picture of a camera , the process , if you put it on the trigger .

a lot of arguments are about it . fishing pollution is the environment that most of you , and at least they &apos;re inefficient , we &apos;re taking tuna . a big part .
and because they work a lot harder than we do , and it &apos;s because they only have three to six months , they speak in their weight , in the energy consumption , a little bit of three billion people .
so , if you take the system , as i was taught , and all the error eradicated health care system , then at the end of no longer left .
i think that the remarkable values in the last few years that have been the last decades , is that we are shaped by a physical world .
so gender is really complicated ; sexual sex is not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a way that you can distribute across the entire bandwidth .
and by the way , we go down and cow and we mix so much so much that they can &apos;t tell you that isolation is necessary for evolution to find .

the passengers for the insake objects are not just humans , but the light that appears on them and the wind that drives them over and the heat of the room .
but tomorrow , it can , to enable us to challenge the challenges -- think of climate change or climate change -- as we can change from the digital world to the physical .
while i &apos;m doing that , i &apos;m going to give you some of the lessons that i &apos;m going to tell you whether you believe it or not , from these adventures , nothing new to wear .
it demands that we enable all of our senses to the task , and that we use our minds , like our feelings and our emotions , our challenge , the challenge we face .
and we start by taking the waste , which is already there , in these refrigerators or dry cuts at reactors . that &apos;s our strong fuel .
now , with all our digital devices , the seven days a week , 24 hours a day , all this negative news , it &apos;s not a miracle that we are pessimistic .

well , in our town , in the volunteer , a highly skilled firemen , you have to be pretty early on at the place to be able to mix with .
and most of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom , the wisdom and the wisdom of wisdom that we will need to make these choices ?
the transistor was a little plastic unit that would take us off from a world of steel , stacking building blocks into a world that was all interactive .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for miles , &quot; there are hundreds of people in the entire country who are open and government application every day in their own communities .
so these communities began to evolve so that the level of evolution that occurred in which evolution was no longer the single cell , but the whole of the cell , which we call the organism .
first of all , we have injured the doors , and in fact , we have a device that can communicate with him -- a stephen hawking machine .
and part of me wondered , what if the content of a personality would be something that could be done in the future of machine -- using mri ?

and this is a little bit of our vision of a reasonable energy system , and i &apos;m a cradle to cradle too , that they &apos;ve said that solar energy use .
and the wind plant , or the solar panels , or whatever it is , is in the rule of a system , a system of care system , which can only store in small quantities here .
that means , if we look at existing models of something else , for example , the metaphor , i can do that as a result .
so , really , really exciting processes that go into this , yes , gray matter , you &apos;re not actually here , but right here in this singular mass , you know .
the exciting stage was when we took this piece of content , and we took a bacterium , and we started reading the bacteria around the genetic code , and we made it viral particles .
the data is used in the gray box , the centrifuge , the centrifuge , and the iranian energy program is deluded .
i have a company that makes design and animations , so graffiti is a complex part of what we consider in the art world , and we pay attention .

so the people who decided that they wanted to participate , rather , that the more they were available to give them , the more the more that they choose to choose the more active and the fund .
that means that if you know what , if you look at that , you &apos;ll see who , for a long period of time , because i &apos;m not going to take a seat for what &apos;s going to happen , it &apos;s going to happen .
so it &apos;s just as in hollywood movies as the glacier trajectory , as the defect is chasing the surveillance of the surveillance of video before .
we have these whole superpowers , serving productivity , the ability to put social networks , to light , to light , to be more light , and to demand the desire for epic meaning .
so , of course , the crazy thing of my talk is that we &apos;re moving , because we &apos;re not going to move physical , virtual worlds , virtual worlds , really after the image of the holocaust .
i know you &apos;re going to be asking , &quot; how do we solve problems in the real world ? &quot; and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve done in the last few years in the past , the future for the future .
we can look at our kids playing football , and we have our cell phone to a chicken , and our blackberry chickens , and our laptop , and our laptop , probably on our shoe .
just the things that vary , like shooting , like bosnia , like ribbbbbbons , like authenticers , that they need to be in biological systems .
hide . i get you right ? your software suggests that at a certain point in time , within the next few years , all images that are being used by somebody in the world are being used together in order to connect with each other ?

and the reason for this is because it &apos;s one of the first things that we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve got a lot of genes that have been selected to get chosen , and the population has been removed .
so , here we have a complete parallel path of education where young people learn what it means to be a good player , like anything else they learn in school .
my father , for example , was a chemist , and i can &apos;t remember his situation in 40 years as a chemist who was asked , whether he was afraid of being a chemist .
play is a form of formula , and it can take a lot of shapes that some of them are a little bit more quieter , hostile , curiosity -- maybe to discover the astonishing thing .

if we &apos;re going to put it back in the field of software , here &apos;s the first line of the interfaces , which were very abstract , where you used months to deal with these systems .
yes , there are 9.5 percent saltwater , two percent , and we &apos;re fighting about 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s hope .
so , useless always means how to achieve a certain goal , or how to make a users in a specific context , effectively , effective and satisfaction to achieve a goal .
this is in the picture on the left , you see biodiversity , which is a hacking , basically , in a kind of school , a private school , nonprofit space , where everyone can come from .
the transition there is now where these communities are together so close to the fact that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into a chain on dna .
but the other thing is , we believe that if we see every day that the tasks we throw away , we don &apos;t just disappear , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
now , the brain lowest epidemic in which we &apos;re in right now is this absurd battle between the worker of engineering and biofuels .
so they either live together , or they went down , and that meant that if a community had succeeded , all the individuals of the community were repeated and proliferated by evolution .
this is the greatest time ever there was on this planet , no matter what kind of health care is , by mobility , by mobility , by mobility , pedestrian disease .

that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of honduras , who meant that we need to be doing this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way we bring our country forward .
and to be honest , the only and the remaining disability that i had to deal with each other is that the world is constantly meant to be able to describe me with these definitions .
now , of course , on a kind of disappointment , the debate was again about the value of science and engineering scales , and it &apos;s very easy to disagree with this .
now , you might think that the problem of humans who , certainly lived as they lived in silly societies , were killing animals , and only after a few generations , what they had done .
the small ones that we added to was that we asked people to just think of all positive things that would happen in their lives if they were going to save money .

and so you get an idea that , if you look at this kind of information , more fiercely , broad , zoom in , you zoom in , you don &apos;t find that kind of surveillance .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing that the performance of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen right now , it also has a very flexible architecture .
the dropper strikes on the gray box , when a particular configuration was discovered , even when the special program , which tries to inform it on that goal .
and once again , if you have a way to feel these three times in other people , because you &apos;re going to be happy , if you don &apos;t remember your lies .
but we also seem to have this kind of call . but not just the writers , but the creative noises of all , seem to have this call , mentally unstable .
you know , we really have -- modern goals like the whole petrochemical industry . if you couldn &apos;t do that at ted , where else could a source of energy ?
the u.s. intelligence agency , two months ago , was the swiss bank accounts of grass in here , and on that congress , there were 14.9 million dollars when it was frozen .

what happens is , obviously , that money is not an experience of happiness , but that lack of money is certainly under a monkey , and we can measure this very , very , very clear .
we should use the effects of effective measures to reduce the reduction in the way . the less we do , the carbon dioxide is going to be the sum of co2 and the temperature .
in this case , we have three sidelines as color pottery , and i can use them to pour the color in the middle of the middle , where they are then mixed .
one of the interesting implications of interactions that we started to realize was that we could apply everyday data on data , such as color , such as scores as you do with fluid .
well , it turns out that climate isn &apos;t very important for the living self , and it &apos;s not even very important to think about the thinking itself , how happy people are .

i want you to imagine something now , a portable robot that gives you human capability , or another wheelchair that helps you to go out and walk back and forth .
so today , i want to take you on a journey through the ethics of ethnicity , a little journey through the nosphere to try and understand what &apos;s actually gone .
the coolest thing about this is -- and this includes all the circle -- that there is this april , when you get in the inner city of los angeles , a exhibition called the art of the art .
we all know that the interactive media is the non-linear , which includes the sensitivity of the linearity , and , of course , that we find the linearity today as being normal .

if you &apos;re going to become more intuitive , and then i have to put my little friend here , and look at what it means , because that &apos;s just from the cognitive perspective , when are you really going to do something now ?
of course , the age of age is not just about perceptual and neural processing or cognition , but , of course , of course , the theme of the human-object relationship .
if you think of &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people have been touched like this -- except for the smallpox story , why were they so touched by the image of the world ?

and from this soul , you know , that somehow in that clouds , in this cloudy air nature , it &apos;s called in the latin mountains , which is also present .
so , extracting and depicted , we found the attack code -- and we found that it was in two digital sprinkler heads -- a smaller and bigger one .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way we can actually synthesize this chromosome , which allows us to combine the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
when the stupid goddamn genius , which is to your side , decide for a moment , for a moment , a little bit of a miracle through your effort , then charges .
what the terraction concept means is , instead of a judgment , which is one percent , which is 35 percent , we decided to burn 99 percent , burn the 99 percent , which is 238 .

in other words , you &apos;ve found in this mental , evolutionary way , a way that allowed you to write defeat , which is , in fact , that this information could be copied and copied .
if you can imagine these 20 million different genes , or these processes to optimize octopus , or new drugs , we can change with just a small molecular team more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and pivot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites -- and we bring this zoom-technology to every single website like this one .

but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program that you can program , and you can also hide it , so , and that &apos;s what i found incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper into it .

and i also want to end with that sentence , and with that sentence , i &apos;d like to close , to give the clues to thinking , to think , to come up with new solutions , and in that sense , thank you very much for your attention and for your attention .
and i know it &apos;s definitely , for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to begin to capture this dark path of the suspect -- especially in which i was in my career .
the older black man stood on . he looked at the puppety , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come down to say this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal . don &apos;t give you a sense of eyes . &quot;
so , the problem of cooperative world-class online world-class worlds , is that it &apos;s so satisfying , at the moment of an episode , we prefer to prepare for our time in these worlds .
later on the day , i was driving on this piece of ground with guel and i asked him , &quot; i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be so different than any farm that i &apos;ve ever been on , &quot; how do you succeed ? &quot;
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice caps , which , for three million years , had been the size of the 48 states to keep 40 percent .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles to philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- to 50 percent of all young black men in either men , in jail , in jail , are abandoned with punishment .
immediately after this choice between the 21st and the 24th of february , a delegation of about 30 famines were interested in the two places that were most interested in the world , in the business of the urban bands .
the last example i have today is to show you , is a musician dna sequencing for trickling , which we &apos;ve developed recently and in the training of sound , like leadership , voice and bass .
and we started making pieces , starting with the five and a half thousand letters until seventh grade letters contains these 240,000 annihilals to get back to this point of view , to get back to 27,000 .
it enabled us to tell the story of neuromarketing , as we tell the story of the film today , that you use mris to enhance the central stages of the brain , both to make advertising and movies .
so i started thinking , and so i think with the safety of the past months , while i was working on the book , the book is going to be soon -- when the dangerous , scary , subsequent of my success .
both in my profession and robin , and also , in my case , i am a volunteer fire department , and i have a lot of generosity and generosity , but i also see the overlooked love of the mummy and love of mutche .
imagine living in a particular remote area , and they loved a beloved person with cardiac heart disease , and they transferred their doctor to a cardiologist , whose average performance is depicted at 200 feet .
but when i was working with him , and asked him why he had to do this intervention -- it was risky -- that his answer was , in his country , that these kids would be very bad , and so he had to do it .
and , of course , when it &apos;s intuitive , and of course , how i can take it as an age and make it an outcome , the things that you use as a friendly , so you &apos;re intuitive , because you &apos;re fun and then you &apos;re fun to use it .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two fundamental positions -- the ones that make mistakes and those who do not do , the ones that make the sleep , and the limits without the limitations , the bad outcome and the good outcomes .
it has three big problems too . the cost , especially in high-resolution countries , and the question for security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human contribution that the fuel isn &apos;t being used for guns .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we have a fear of real gasoline , and it will stop millions of people from bloom .
now , to decide not to buy a glass of glass , probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our daily -- but it turns out that the decision-making problem of overlaps also affects us very different decisions .
i don &apos;t have to attract these kinds of emotionally , because at the same time , it &apos;s always going to be a crazy , colorful , colorful punishment , which is just on me , if i love a little bit in the heart , and it &apos;s going to love .
so this is one of the things . the other effect is that , even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end up with less peace than the election , if we had the opportunity to choose between us less possibilities .
this is a photograph that i took at the north of the baffling baffles , when i went to the inmates of al jagdid , and this man , this guy , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather &apos;s grandfather .
and in fact , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the memory itself , and you can think of that as a reminder of life itself through experiences that don &apos;t need to be alive .
i mean , if i &apos;m in the light at home , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people go up and i listen to all these things , because i don &apos;t want to open it up , or leave it , leave it away .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to do strip and do less and less , but in average , that number will increase every year , and so forth as more than double , the number of services per person will be provided .
i met these people of gray , graffiti research , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any particular surface , and then to draw a laser pointer on them .
so , what that means is , if we look back at what &apos;s going on inside of evolution , and how we think about the place of humans in evolution in evolution , and particularly how we predict the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a number of possibilities .
so there are big challenges here . there are challenges in translation . if we say that the energy outside of the country is outside the country , it &apos;s not just because they need to deal with the risk of energy that comes from where it comes from .
but , as we think , the only way to think about biology is to have a huge impact on the cost of food , or the limitation of its constraints , when we see co2 as carbon footprint , and so we work on these cells .
i started working with the scientific literature on how these centrifuels are built in natasha and found that they &apos;re structured in so-called kaskan , and every cascade in 164 .
now the intriguing thing is that the takoline , which contains the liane in the liane , may have been inhibited by the kind of bitors that are necessary to enforce the tamins of tamins . so they ask themselves .
this is a problem because the warming of the frozen reason to put the arctic ocean on the ocean , where there &apos;s big amounts of frozen carbon , which , when it &apos;s inflated by micromethane .
and what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack was actually to let it go slowly and uncertain -- obviously in trying to make the engineers desperate , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get into the situation so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get behind them .
so maybe the german change of this technological transformation , because the more that there was always a different truth , which is that every man who can give something special and very powerful and can be very full and that the ability to adapt to human ability is to adapt our plus greatest plus .
my good friend ray short has shown us that every tool that &apos;s going to become the information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , it makes a big jump , and the price of prior to every 24 months .
the first project we &apos;ve done as a international group , as we &apos;ve become aware of ourselves as our own self , o.k , there are now of us as real scene here , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people that are always there and so forth .

what if we could turn these situation around , and put the internet on its head , so that instead of going from one to another , we can start to go from many of the many things to many things , and by realizing which ones would be ubiquitous .
that is , we feel so guilty about the world , that we say , there &apos;s no bio-land , no bioluminescence , no mammals , no prosthetic prosthetics , and they all allow for the fact that our own credit goes back to us .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i made something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in libesides organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is being put into two dead cells .
this was worth taking it for me to take all this year to the clean room , because check it out , the mask of the massless between one and one piece of metal is about as much as the difference between the metal and the metal of it .
and then i got it to six-and-a-half , and then we got together with friends , i became the founder of the company , and then the donor has become involved with the spin of a major cell company in the world .
at that time , it was just as much as a monkey , where tall , cloned and told other people , in fact , they were saying , you &apos;re going to start reading the people when they &apos;re going to read , they &apos;re still trying to talk afterwards , and of course , this is completely fatal .
if a guy in spain is doing something unpossible , something magical has done : allah , ol√© , ol√© , allah , good , brave , brown , unbelievable , it &apos;s a whispering view of god .
so what &apos;s going on inside the pocket is that everything from the bottom up to the bottom , from the very beginning to the very bottom , is completely vertical -- by the title , you &apos;re going to see the film that you &apos;re going to be seeing , that marx brand .
and the message is now , we need to pay attention to these rotating animals , if we kind of forced our goals to speak , 20 percent , 20 percent forced , three , three , three and so on and so on , if we want to do it , then we want to do it .
they then wrote about a three-month dream with a &quot; plenty of &quot; a &quot; note , &quot; which was very good . it was told to tell you that they were very smart , and after these three months , they actually wrote her .
what i &apos;ve done is -- what i &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve made this code -- the code of normal letters that we use to symbolic -- and i &apos;ve written my visitors on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve written it 10 times bigger .
and i wonder today , as his vision of me as a strong and powerful girl , had shaped my own self-image , and i could imagine that as a whole nature of strong , strong and lethal to see .
and that &apos;s where you &apos;re going to be located from my doctor &apos;s office so that he can see where my weight is , and that &apos;s not just in the moment that i need cardiac good support or something , but also with a glimpse in the past .
but in fact , it was an outsider in the early &apos; 80s when i started out with elementary school , so my picture started to build my family &apos;s product and forms in terms of other kids , and to rest me around the world .
it &apos;s a first picture of the beam beam , which returned the whole bc around the lhc , and then , in a part of the lhc collide , to make a flock of particles on top of the detector .
he killed his 400,000 people , because he insisted that red wells , left-handed and lemon oil is much more effective than antiretroviral drugs , that we know that they can be based on aids .
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dramatic and so inspiring and so inspiring , and so inspiring , we &apos;re not going to measure technology at the end of our technology , we &apos;re not going to develop the things that we &apos;re not going to develop on , we &apos;re not going to develop on our hands and our mind .
what i &apos;m doing instead , and what the designers are doing to do is to think , we &apos;re on a certain abstract , translation of this machine , and the machine does something that goes far beyond our skills , far better and faster than we could ever do .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , and architects , even with ctos , for example , and there &apos;s something about this problem , which gives deep insights into the nature of nature , and i want to share some of them with you .
and as you can see , you know , we have seven senses that most of us think we have only five times , even seven , since there &apos;s certainly coming in the next future , the next sense of expanding , and as extension of our own self .
what you have to do there is , maybe it &apos;s easy , but that &apos;s not what you &apos;d have to do , you &apos;d have to burn the co2 that &apos;s coming out of the shame , put it in pressure , put it under pressure , and then somewhere , and then you &apos;d like it to be there .
and like a miracle , he took his violin and he started to play a couple of cuts of inconcerts , and then he asked me to play it , in the end of the game , in tapestries , iski , lima .
i was committed to the place and my brother and his father -- with the words , &quot; well , my proposal is this : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to find him a device , and we &apos;ll find a way to make his art work again .
now , i have to say , if i was a college student , i thought , okay , death , sex , death , death for sex -- it seemed to be pretty sensible at the time , but every year it came to my two feet .
i &apos;m a historian historian , and in this case , i study how people went around to anatomy -- human body , animal body -- how they went around with body , with fluids , with body concepts of body , how they thought about bodies .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the minister of health , who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to accept the evidence of my mammography or &quot; some creator , the creator who wants to treat his patients with caffs .
so , if i do this , the profiles , go to the scene , then collect those samples , and then turn them into this method , and then they can say , o.ar , this hair belly , that &apos;s what people are hearing .
he revealed the dog and improvised an irreverent , which took the skeleton of the dog , and made a terrible dog , another dog and scraped over the ice and the ice sheet with the black tidal knife .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s acquisition or amesthetic twins , is it &apos;s because of a lot of sexual surgeons , a lot of the norms that are adapted to their physical health .
because ... at the end of it , it &apos;s followed by centuries , centuries from north america to monuments , with holy fears of dances and music , who have been dumped for hours -- until dawn .
so , i also wrote an article , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that , &quot; frankenstein , &quot; why do they think that molecules are going to be a certain kind of randomness , rather than having a handshaking access to nature of nature .
and then the next ones that have been working with nem neural model , or the mental model of the software , they &apos;ve been working , which is , you &apos;ve done something that the metaphor of a metaphor , the metaphor of a computer , to make the use of the computer .
the spirits can be described by the great water , respond to the rhythm of the dance , to the soul of the soul , to urge the soul of the living act , so that the olythyield will end a brief moment to god .
it was on a piano curriculum for my music student at my beloved teacher , professor jude , a famous beethoven semiconductor , and a ceramic professor , and a slow professor at the high school music school there .
but that &apos;s the way my prototype is so different , but the one that has seen it , so on , the thing that goes on , on electronics and pressure , and that was the pressure , but was too high , the thing that was broken .
we took a ps3 camera , we took it out , we put it on a leather , and we now have a device that &apos;s free -- you can build it yourself , you can put the code for free , you can download free .
we look in this net , we see the fifty hertz , and if it &apos;s not going to come up with nine hertz , we &apos;re going to make some ventilts , then we &apos;re going to go back a little bee , and then we &apos;re going to get back up again .
so a couple of years ago , i started a program to get the stars into technology , and to take a year off , and work in an environment , which is pretty much what they hate , in fact , we have them working in the government .
in which we did this simple thing , we had a rise of participation , and we had a 20 percent increase , and we had a number of people who were willing to save , or have a rise of four percent when they were willing to pay for the savings .
there are some evidence that perhaps the neanderthal of 60,000 years ago , there are more older people and with severe body injuries , and perhaps , because the life experience in the survival of these people was valuable to society is that .
now , we have tri-bi-like laws that bring people back to behind bars , for a bike steel stake , for the theft of state , rather than having them do , that they give the things to the sacrifices .
the idea is , again , imagine what we &apos;re going to do with people to change something and the environment -- almost as we call it , cloud movement , building a disappointment , but moving with a cloud .
and yeah , so , you can see , it &apos;s relatively heterogeneous , so there are people who are doing that on their home , up to large organizations , which is much larger organizations , which are already doing more of the form in institutional form .
and for me , the question is , what are we going to do is we &apos;re going to do this kind of science in the field of anatomy that we &apos;re going to get a point where we need to admit that democracy , that democracy , could be based on anatomy ?
i &apos;ve graduated in graduate , and i hope that video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the bachelor &apos;s work of michael burk , kathrin kathrone , jorchis , janitors and janitors of garbage .
and it gets better , it gets things that you and i &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars -- gps , video and libraries , libraries of books and music , technology , medical diagnostics -- now literally become more tangible and cheap in your pocket .
heinrich , because you assume that he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you he &apos;s the xy -- you know , there &apos;s a male annual , he &apos;s now moved to , what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .

because i think that the interactive media in the archaic , cognitive computer address , so paradigm , paradigm in our biological memory has been programmed very , very long time ago , and that we can now extend the media through media .
afterwards , the old tyrannian civilization , which included the cartoons of the colombia &apos;s column and moved to the order of the people in this empirical volcanic , back to the caribbean bage of the badge level .
and before the background , i have been in the area of user interface , so the next generation of people in the computer , so in the relationship of the human relationship with the computer , how our tools are changing , or how computers are changing from the computer &apos;s computer to the digital assistance .
and i know some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it so better ? &quot; the world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we all speak one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s do this language . let &apos;s be lungs .
so , she goes to the house , and after the paper , and she drives the poem through her , and she reaches a pencil as a pencil , and then she goes through it , and then she said -- it was as if it were to reach with her other hand and then put it on her hand .
if i were to take this assignment seriously , i would be born into a world where someone would perceive me as a person like a person who &apos;s in their lives in a positive way , but today i &apos;m going to go for the opportunities for opportunities and adventure that i have celebrated .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and easy to discover , and instantly , instantaneously , looking characterized by the information and information , particularly , what &apos;s going on -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
we have this plan of living , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to have a rich hand , and it didn &apos;t do all the fences that i wanted to do , all the experiences that i wanted to do , and i never did .
if we change the plastics so that it can go to biological systems , if we change the water storage , that they can go back to cell soul , then they can back with a baby in israel or in tunisia in five hundred trees .
and it turns out that under a 60,000 dollars of income , in the year , for americans , this is a very big sample of american samples , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a great representation of representatives under a 600,000 dollars per year .
i think it might be more likely to be clear that we don &apos;t necessarily have to be overwhelmed , but that we are open to the poor , to put them on the optical , and also to use a fight and maybe even dancing them .
the congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the darkness of the darkness -- the founder of a violent dispute , which has been asking for decades , and has a lot of lives like the first world war .
so , this whole discussion of how is going to move right now -- and energy , energy , like this , is supposed to be on the island , for example , for five to three percent of the population , so we &apos;re going to end up getting the wind and the sun .
so we started with a few volunteers , who started to have more than a year in seattle , helped to tag the things that they were doing -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that were throwing away from them .

now , if you take this picture -- i am originally italian , and every young woman in italy with this image in his room , but the reason why i show you this is because of the formula in the past three decades , something interesting happened .
now , in some of the following conclusions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermal sources , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that no one ever had ever seen before , and for the science to look at when we saw them , we haven &apos;t found words yet .
we believe that polemilek -- we think that smallpox isn &apos;t persuasive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best for storytellers in the world . our 35 million every month .
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be distributed in terms of human beings , because i have to admit that i know a series of trips that probably is more likely to deserve social value than some people i know .
and this is , and this is what we have to look at millions of times of problem-solving around the world if we have to take the next century , which is taking the face of attack , and take the face of all the drivers at the ranging of a epic episode .
what &apos;s different about children &apos;s children is that they &apos;re starting to start with the marshmallow and prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow , so that they have the majority of these kinds of prototypes to repair them .
and then , among the things that are already there , that are the everyday in the everyday , which is most people don &apos;t realize , for example , the median enzyme , which allow us to wash up with four-degree washing , is also optimistic .
and then they go to the consumer electronics business to put together a stereo speaker -- speakers , a cd player , a radio player , a radio player , and a stronger , and in this electronics business there is so many stereo papers .
i think that they were so potent and strong , and so radical , in what they were doing , that i took all of the years to see the paintings of malware 1776 , and it &apos;s not because of music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten to forget .
what we have learned from overwhelming studies is that women , on average -- not every one , but on average -- tend to be more complex social relations , and the people within the group , are very vulnerable , very much attention .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i spoke to a few years ago , who had brought a couple of siamters in with herds to separate them in order to make them part of a name .
in order to envision these theories , what we call remembers is that it &apos;s definitely ubiquitous , it has to be degraded , it has to be a wedding goal , and it &apos;s probably very likely to be in iran , because most of the infections are infected .
i don &apos;t know if this is smart , if you take the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in discourse about whether you should have this , if you should have the things that are going to come faster , or you need to expect that innovation as we expect .
and this was a giant dude , of course , because of course you started putting the living language into the form of writing , which is , which is what fluid and living , i live in a rock , and i do it in a rock , and i do it with that .
as the cloning cat corporation , their most important selling catastrophe , they were told that they were going to reduce the 87 percent by 87 percent -- a result of the increase in sales and reducing the cost of the cost .
so the tedtalk in a very simple form that charter city is a place of where uninhabited land is a foster of foods , the laws of laws that allow people to choose and choose the opportunity to decide whether to live under those rules or not .
we followed the genetic generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people about this , they asked them to become one of the people that was so old , because of his age , and we killed him with the spearer , and yet he had a spear .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple in the comparison of our confidence , and i think it &apos;s simple , but if we look at all of these genes that we can eliminate from one of the other , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a cell .
if you just want to pick a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose that wish , that one of the more energy source of energy is going to be no energy . this desire is what i &apos;m going to do .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for an outlook , but what he really looks like is somebody who &apos;s shaking it , when he &apos;s in front of him , because he doesn &apos;t know very well , he &apos;s not very good at fought when he &apos;s covered in a snow .
and at this point , the patients come into the game , they can &apos;t just take control of the control , they can be on their own ship , but they can also help us deal with the challenges that we care about , and the health care system , and so on .
and then there &apos;s a reminder of self , and the memory itself is the self , the lest and the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor talks about by asking the question , &quot; how did you feel about it in time ? &quot;
now in the world of savings , i think one of the best examples that recently came out on the marketplace is how to evaluate the best choice of choice , something that david lason has been very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s been offered at harvard .
about an hour after she &apos;d come home , after coming home , i &apos;d sent her back home , she &apos;d collapsed the family , and she &apos;d launched 911 . the rescue assisted her back to the emergency room with a bloodline that &apos;s a dangerous condition .
but i remember the lights of the oil spill off the coast of malayan coast , and the young man who broke down , and the end of the journey was too much for him , and on the first taste of the gulf , gave me a platform on my platform .
well , what this thing does is that it starts with the sensors of sensors -- so , for example , the sensors of vibrating sensors and vibrating sensors -- and it provides legitimacy to the code that goes on with the wrong data , right data .
how can these people come from a flora of 80,000 species of adinertian plants find these two morphologically related plants that , if they can combine , they can combine a kind of biochemical version of that &apos;s bigger than the sum of its parts ?

and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that down there are only three fingers , because the way the mind works , how it doesn &apos;t count , doesn &apos;t count one , two , three , but you see as a group .
and these claws and these rhythms of rhythm have the geology , the topography of a region , and of course , it has enabled , of course , that you could put these songs together and put together so on and so forth , and then move on to the right , and also to move back to the rider .
i also think there are theories that begin to understand how all along with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplistic story of which , in fact , that these little oil spills , which contains different kinds of recipient chemicals .
how many times we have chosen a political leader -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy to choose a new political leader to choose -- and then we look back and we expect the government that reflects our values and our needs , and then our needs changed , and then not changed so much ?
now this could happen within the lifespan of a single organism , whereas for hundreds of years , because these evolutionary information had to be learned from the people who were frustrated by the individuals who were frustrated by this fruit , because these information structures weren &apos;t there .
for example , there is an example of the anecdote that the report of the captain of a soundtrack , so that in this area the big fish bias can &apos;t be used to be used , or from fisheries , or from scientists , they don &apos;t usually be accomplished because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;

so not only do you have a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals , not just a farm that &apos;s going to give you a success of your health , but a farm that is literally an underwater plant , and it &apos;s not just that fish , but for you and for me .
that you don &apos;t need to be overwhelmed with word for the word in a different language , but also the deep sense of words and atrocities , and so you have to understand that there &apos;s a meaningful translation of translation , everybody who has to do with strangers .
and , again , if i take a step back , and look at everything , i can rearrange my anger , maybe after my past , here , i &apos;ve looked up at netimesh , which is , after here , there &apos;s something like , live picking .
now , what you could do with patient , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s been done , and you could actually do the reflection of the patient &apos;s patient , by just leaving the tube to a very , very , very close to him .
you can do it around the will to challenge the challenge , the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment that you can do . you can find it because of the noise , and because of the weird connection , when a small group of people have a team .
and i took them down with ambassador &apos;s access to the world at the bottom of the world : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , the people who were interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to look around , and they were able to test samples and so on .
do you understand that that that &apos;s not just what people are doing when they &apos;re going to retire , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go back to the money ; they &apos;re going to make it so difficult to make sure that they have to adapt to their employers .
and during that whole period , they become culturally introduced into the values of their society . the values that say that the math sustain their prayers , and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological balance -- balance .
the leaders of the government in honduras would be accumulated to the aid of partnerships , they could benefit from their partnerships that they could support the laws of the charter for this charter and the leadership that everybody could contribute to that that the charter is really going to go through .

he drove at high speed than he suddenly did a small fragment of a melody , which is like the inspiration , which is often the same for him , is hard for him , and he wants them . he &apos;s full . he &apos;s full . he &apos;s full of them , but he can &apos;t touch them .
another example : a couple of years ago , i received the phone call from a 19 year-old man who was born when young , when he had a young friend , he had a friend of his girlfriend , when he was living , and he just found that he had frozen eggs and mom .
but only because there was a company , an agency that was ready to help us -- and that was also because i had to walk john bond and richard sheni had to know -- i knew i had to do it alone , i had to deal with my team directly to go to the companies .
in fact , i &apos;ve been looking at the biggest part of my career in terms of an adolescent situations , and that &apos;s all for the social attempt to explore social attempts , so that they &apos;re compelling and very interesting , and hopefully , in a way that makes you seek to seek the audience and make it accessible .
this curiosity showed up in the fact that when i was not in school , through the forests of the woods and the samples , the samples and the samples , and the long beetles and beetles and beetles , and the water would bring it home , put it under the microscope .
she ran out of the devil as she was trapped in this poem , and the only thing she did was she had to get out of the sheet and get a piece of paper , so she had to catch it when she got through donnell , and she could get on the tuna .
the next couple of weeks , i felt like , and i went to the first place myself , and the first time , the healthy people in our medical culture -- i felt alone , not by myself , not by isolating , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
now , i like a little bit extreme , you know , in the process of doing some research on the reef of memory , but even if you have more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why are we adding a lot of weight in the mind of the mind that we have ?
you can imagine this cultural network of food web as a nosphere of ethnicity . nosphere can be defined as the total sum of all dreams , myths and myths , options , and intuitions that have been inspired by the human imagination since the human mind has been embedded in the consciousness .
so where the founding fathers were extreme to figure out how do the state of the state , it &apos;s possible that if we were to put more mothers in this concept , we could not only find a concept of how to protect , but how to care for each other .
the main reason for this is that we might be enjoying this great , full of ratios , vericks , verify , and march meline , but we don &apos;t see the same measurement , and then we can actually choose something from the fantastic shop .
he was talking about music , and talking about music , from this paranoid , the man , who was just going to go through the streets of los angeles , was a lowering , educated , skilled adolescents , in some trained musicians .
we talked about this issue . and you know , what ? most of his life was the embodiment of the embodiment of the modern era , which was trying to control these inconvenient creative impulses that would allow him to do in his life , and to deal with them .
i &apos;m going to describe to you now a study that i &apos;m going to describe to you with guitar , before enica , i bet ji , who we are in the future , we &apos;re going to have to make the decisions from almost a million americans to about 650 in the united states .
the reason for that is that , if i put it on a normal curve , where we say , this is the years , so this is the timeline of a kind , and this is a beer type of technology that i want to talk to you about , which is what i want to be a graph of the albern .
and when i think about it , i think of a vacation that we did a few years ago in antarctica , the most clearly of the best vacuum , i &apos;ve ever had , and i think of times as much as i often think of them as i often think of them .
and maybe a small look at what might happen in a few decades , if cyborg has a borg to explore something or to do other things , in all the humanitarios that i can think of as a science-fiction .
a lot of companies tend to do that -- and this is the human nature -- avoid stuff where they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re going to be afraid , these elements , and they come to welcome these welcome , and they turn them into something positive , and that &apos;s an historic thing .
we don &apos;t have the situation where it is , for example , in iran , where a man who feels sexually transferred to other men , who &apos;s going to be death , is going to be so he &apos;s ready to move to a gender line in which he can stay alive .
and they will be leveraged by the use of the tricoder , and they will be trained by the khani hanging hanging academy , and so that they will have the possibility that they will have 3d printer , and so much more productive than ever before .
now we know now that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that the nature of nature is not something between male and female , or male and female , and female and sexual interspecies ; we are there , of course , are the ones that are of course , of course .
so , if you look at google glass , for example , then this is a concept that will recombine the virtual world with the real world , it &apos;s called the &quot; monkey to virtual , &quot; which will find something more natural than natural , recommendation , again .
for a while , i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect . it may seem strangely that a magician is interested in looking at it , because it &apos;s as i think as &quot; deception , &quot; which is something that &apos;s going to happen if somebody thinks enough . &quot;
we &apos;ve been working with roberto boll , one of the best ballet dancers of our time -- the metropolitan theater theater in new york city , and the mascala -- we &apos;ve taken his movements in 3d to use it for the impulse .
there are some mushroom projects that are going to be at 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get 100 percent , and it &apos;s going to be very difficult for the co2 level , and that &apos;s a big challenge , but that &apos;s the biggest problem here .
so what you got is this : your name here : my tedtalk , you know , you don &apos;t have a clue what will be the theme of your topic , and at the end of your content , you could fly around the ears , especially if you &apos;re involved in your company .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to be able to rediscover what we are , with people who are aware of the importance of being aware of all humans and gardens to become a room in the face of the face , and there are great moments of optimism .
now , these older people are coming to me and saying , &quot; mr , stewart , you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re talking , tell the people you need to stop saying that we &apos;re going to be doing it for the first time in the history of our nation &apos;s nation : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
now , the people behind , or the back , who , later , will look at the video at some point , say , &quot; well , that &apos;s right , that &apos;s right , but if it were real , it would be real , you would see , it &apos;s a hole here , and if it was real , it would be real , it would be true . &quot;
now , as a result of that , he &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenics , and the ones are so bad , and he &apos;s disappearing , and he &apos;s disappearing in the streets of row , he &apos;s always cranging from this hormone and torture of his own mental mind .
he spoke in a very healthier and healthier about yo-yo and hillary clinton about how the dodgers would never make it in the world , and that would be because of all the passenger pigeon prices in the last night of beethoven .
and whenever we think about innate and landscape , we either think rousy , and the old scaffolding of the wild , which in its simplicity is a rapid thought , or at the other thoreau , and say , these people are more connected to us than we are .
i wanted to go back to the routine , and the jellyfish of the unknown life -- a grandmother , a grandmother , two daughters and a two daughters that had as much as their twenty years as they were telling each other by putting together the stories of their storytelling and every single day we were sleeping on the same bed .
but we don &apos;t even prefer to listen to someone like this because we &apos;ve been saying this kind of statement for a long time , so somehow we &apos;ve inhibited the insurance and accepted that creativity and somehow of creativity -- that art always leads to the end of disposal .
and what we &apos;ve done , actually , was to use a new kind of network of network that was used all over the world -- this is a mobile phone network -- and anonymous information and aggregated on this network of information that are being collected from nearby nearby nearby , to understand how the city works .
and then the renaissance came and changed everything . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual in the center of the universe -- about gods and mystery . and there &apos;s no more room for mystical creatures that are susceptible .
in our desire to protect the people who are protecting us at heart and the odds of the truth , to share their medical school , or even to create a projection of quality that they have to expect , we don &apos;t have to admit that we are actually disabled to be disabled .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that overlap the problem of decision-making equipment -- you &apos;re going to be aware of the superfluidity ; you &apos;re going to be doing it real -- you know , we &apos;re going to be able to deal with more categories , less access to complexity .
because we have this self-deception of being great , delighted , triggering from the highest creature , not one of these kinds of slides , something like an organism that exists in an organism , which is still a comparable way to which things are unsustainable for us .
and that is , if you &apos;re all concerned about your feelings and your politics and your snake and all the other things that we &apos;re talking about , the really exciting government , in the words of tim &apos;s tim lo &apos;clock , which we can do , &quot; we can &apos;t do that alone . &quot;
so this may first seem to be a bit absence , so i repeat it , so that it can work : if we solve problems , poverty , global conflicts and obesity , i think we need to try to play at least 21 billion hours a week for the next week .
and our goal was , we wanted to go down to the seventh 15 percent of the renewable renewables , and then this rest , the last 10 , the rest of the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , and it &apos;s going to work very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work too much for you to make that batteries out of batteries .
but what we found is that 17 brand partners who were willing to take care of these control , who wanted to do with someone who wanted to do such an eighteenth and play like me , who eventually taught us how to tell us about telling stories that we usually couldn &apos;t tell stories -- the stories that never would have been an advertiseed .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you &apos;ve never been able to simulate whether it &apos;s going to work , but since there &apos;s modern supercomputers , you can see it , and you can see that , yes , that &apos;s the right kind of materialistic practice , it looks like that .
but the process , and the heavy sticker , which was surrounded him , was when he took the genius out , where he didn &apos;t have to go back to the anger , and then he came back to where he came from , and he realized that there was no internal , older thing .
this trajectory was that i recently wrote a book -- a biography called &quot; biography , &quot; pray &quot; -- that &apos;s what all of my previous books for some reasons in the world went out to be a great megaher-international event .
one continent is getting a continent , because the guess was that , in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious belief , and of course , there was a voodoo , which is simply the remaining of these very deep , religious thoughts , during the tragic pora of embodied time .
but in fact , in truth , we see more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to be limited , and the unimportant possibilities are going to be unprecedented , then there &apos;s a increase in sales ; there &apos;s going to be a cost ; and there &apos;s a improvement of decision-making .
and one day , he looked at me in one of my practice -- these practices were just mild and nagging -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a powerful , powerful , and it &apos;s young girl , you &apos;re going to be one of these dancers one day .
and on the wind and the sun , the load and the simultaneously came to the outcome , a very exciting outcome of the concern that you had to go through the conventional system , which took about a fifth of a fifth of kilowaters per hour , which is about four cents a quarcents a pound .
and the problem , and the problem is not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can be a simple problem with access to what it does to be like , which is things like trying to throw out a biologically problem-solving problem , and how to do that , or how to do that .
feet tall were using plants to eat damaging skull foods of monopoly cultures , the earth , the fish , the fish and the whole time , and the whole agricultural industry said , &quot; if we feed more cheap people , how bad this can be ? &quot;
not through the latest mighty boxes -- and trade-off inventors , but through frustrations , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not through fresh water , but through the forests , through fisheries and through boats and boats and fish , but through the sea .
so these are the artistic directors that have more artistic directions , so there are many artists , and philosophers and philosophers and collaboration with these technologies to deal with these technologies and asking them to process and to process the creative process , because there &apos;s a lot of exhibition and things that are possible .
and they take that output , they increase the output co2 , which leads to the temperature of temperature , and they increase the temperature of several very negative consequences , and in the weather and the weather , which may worse , which means that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt themselves to the whole changes and whole systems .
and the things that have been flowed are things that are contracted , like the prince , the prince , abandoned , debris , devastating and inflorable , and it &apos;s irreversible , it &apos;s irreversible , it , it &apos;s magic , it &apos;s magic , it &apos;s magic , it &apos;s goodd-like , it .
it wasn &apos;t fast enough . it wasn &apos;t fast enough , and it ran and ran , but it didn &apos;t take the house , and it didn &apos;t go through them , and it would pass it through them , and it would move it over the country , and as it would -- as she said , after a different poet .
so maybe these guys contributed to a modern-day contribution , and if they were doing better than i expected , that would be great , but my core point here is that we have to work on all five of them , and we can &apos;t give them any of them because they &apos;ve given us all , because they &apos;ve had significant problems .
and where you and where you can see how far we &apos;ve gone , what we really wanted to do , and how are we going to be sad that we are at all on earth , you can see that , for example , the obvious part of that , you know , there &apos;s a twenty of 20 clips here , you want to be here , yes , yes ?
in my 20-year medical school , journalism and journalism , i &apos;ve made a personal medical trial about medical error and wrong all to do one of the first things i wrote to the front of my toronto , the white show of my white show , &quot; code , &quot; to learn , to learn .
so , with the total transparency transparency , which is the new thinking that the old thinking on the old button , is not that in the laser agent , and not a beef , is more meat , or other phenomena , that i just want to get the tutor and do that .
now , not exactly what i was hoping to do , but i went up -- the stakes , the flows down , the real fire , the firemen , the firemen over to this point at that time , were already kind of finished , into the room to pick up some shoes .
i had to repeat all sorts of unreusable times with these distances , elevators -- in different colors -- you know , to build my muscles , and i &apos;ve hated them more than anything . i &apos;ve hated them . i &apos;ve had them . i &apos;ve hated them . i &apos;ve hated them .
but we wanted to go a lot further . we wanted to build a bacterial chromosome . it has more than 50,000 letters than 50,000 letters , so we thought , we &apos;re going to build it in the scale of the virus , we could understand the size of the population to understand what the variation of a cell is .
and from a conversation today , with dean , a innovators of the innovators of what i want to share with you -- he gave me the permission -- his technical , &quot; the slums , &quot; and many of you may have heard of them . it &apos;s got the size of a refrigerator in the home .
&quot; cloud-wishes , &quot; something that my friends call &quot; autodesk , &quot; sensors , sensors and robots , robots , 3d printer , that allow us to democratize the production of our planet , democracies , synthetic biology , vaccination , food and digital materials , medicine and artificial intelligence .
look at this amazing demonstrative demonstration of voodoo in a state of cemeal , the coal without charcoal , an amazing feature of the mind of the mind , of the mind of the body , that it holds in that extreme state when it hits the state .
that was the most surreal form of a d√©vu that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i went to the corner , i always knew what was going on in the light of the bike , because i was a film that we used to film the film .
in this image , i have a bush set of despair as a branch of desperate in all directions , because when you look at the tree of life , all of the existing motions of life existing on the branches of these branches have been shown in evolutionary terms of success : they have survivors , and it has been demonstrating and demonstrating .
and the premise of this premise with this premise , then , for example , brian gger in england , has tried to put together a minimum sentiment , so that if you took a pressure of pressure , you have a cure , and you have a burst of burglar brothers , and so on and so forth , and then you have bacteria grow to grow .
and then , from the do-it-it-it-o biorg &apos;s website , and he said , &quot; okay , we &apos;ve got to meet now , we &apos;ve really got to meet it , and then two events , one in london , one in two , 10 to the u.s. , and in the u.s. , san francisco , in san francisco .
so this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 , you &apos;re going to get the zero and you &apos;re going to depend on the number of people who are going to use human and every average for every average of the energy and the energy unit that you &apos;re going to get energy per emitted .
and the realization of president lobo was that , in a sense , i thought about the disagreement as a way of getting the foreign investors to come in and build this city to be more important for all honoras in honduras , which has been very afraid for many years and years .
i read this list of a friend of mine , and i had to laugh at that time , it was so ridiculous , but i was only able to say , &quot; and i couldn &apos;t keep talking , &quot; and stop to read , and stop by the first time that i had to do this , and to tap into this inflammation , and so that i had to become the immense dispute .
so , a group from ara , which i &apos;ve been learning about a while ago , which is a group of students who would like to convey more of the public , who wanted to convey more of what they wanted to learn in the u.n. , and so the street learning is on a little bit , and try to explain to people what n.n.n.
there are 175 address in my supermarket , when you don &apos;t take the extra 10 different olive mites , and you can buy 12 i.p. , you could buy a large number of dessalt trips in the united states , which is that if you don &apos;t have a number of five times in your shop , you &apos;re going to be right for them .
and that was really , really , really , really , really bitter , and then you come into the phase of the stage , which is a picture where i was asking you for 10 years , a thousand years after mark , which was actually , at the time , logic , locomotion , of course , in the collective , whether this is what should be so great .
so , first of all , what i &apos;m going to do is show you how quickly it is , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we have as a microsoft part of a excess year , is oversemissile . and it &apos;s a ragon , and it &apos;s a local area where you can either be located or you can handle huge amounts of visual data .
well , the first thing that if you &apos;re going to be a child , as a baby , is that you &apos;re going to take care of what failure you &apos;ve got , right ? and if you &apos;ve ever allowed your parents to be allowed to play more or less in your pottery , and , in fact , the more eye-opening , the curiosity that your curiosity will be natural .
i mean , i mean , most of our eye of our life -- and i &apos;ve done this -- you know , the psychological present , the presence of about three seconds , which means you know , there are about 600 million people in a month -- there are about 600,000 dollars a month . there are about 600,000 people behind you .
bill gates bill gates : to persuade the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the great scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we just need a few million people , and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a russian reactor to make it work , it &apos;s insurance that it &apos;s only done in the 100 million times .
so , the way this works is that it &apos;s actually done in the academic process , and we thought , well , okay , so maybe we &apos;ve got that , we &apos;ve got a webcam , and then we &apos;ve done that picking up , we &apos;ve done , we &apos;ve made a microscope , and then we &apos;ve got a microscope that &apos;s about a four-times square .
and if i show you 600 magazines , and you show them 10 of the categories , or i give you 400 journals , and these in 20 categories , you believe that i &apos;ve given you a better choice , and better experience than i &apos;ve given you when i &apos;ve given them 400 , if i &apos;ve given them to 600 .
friday &apos;s friday , friday afternoon . god &apos;s work on friday &apos;s friday . &apos; &quot; from the best buy , frightening , friday , friday , friday . &apos; &quot; on day night , she didn &apos;t think that we would do this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
i think one of the great canals -- not the only one , but a significant blessing of these depression , and also suicide , is that people have experienced disappointment because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain that experience , they think it would be their fault .
and the neolithic revolution that brought us the agriculture , and in that moment , the cult of the koran threatening , the poetry of the prosthetics of the proprietary revolution , and the hierarchy and overwhelmingly , was found only 10,000 years ago .
so this is , if you focus a laser beam in the room , on a room , you can catch little particles in the air or in the liquid and then move it into the fluid , so that &apos;s where the content is captured , so the like a toronto is basically a little beam in the air .
if we were great , if we had this paradigm of normal resistance against one of the other , or the strength of the strength , even a little bit more dangerous , audacity , so we could put the forces of so many children , and they invite their special invitation to bring their extraordinary skills into society .
you know , michelangelo , when michelangela , called moons , which means he took the end of the hammer , and he actually waited it on mozf -- you can still see a little unbelievably under a little spot -- and said , &quot; okay , wichon parni ? why don &apos;t you do ? &quot;
but if you &apos;re in the year 2011 , when you &apos;re buying a new color cap printer in the year of the leading the leading laser federal cancers and print a page , you &apos;ve got that helpful helmet on every page , every pattern that gives you a very clear pattern that you &apos;re going to see on your side and you &apos;re going to follow .
now , my colleague with the ascending , assabie , you could take a lot more of that , and take the many other wonderful things that you can perceive with , but i &apos;d like to talk to you about the second part that we discuss , and that &apos;s the emphasis in our concrete of the environment .
now , the problem , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have sympathy for the difficult state of affords , they have an orggeful and colored , but they somehow confront the past in the past , while the real world , returns our world , our world .
i then tried that in my lab a little bit in my lab , trying to figure out a little bit of a piece of paper , and then give me a little bit of ebay and made a little bit of n.n.p. analysis , trying to make a nightmare , so you know , d.c. printed , you know , advice .
and if you were to choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two types of self and you have to think about how you &apos;re going to do this , and it &apos;s not really obvious , because if you &apos;re going to get a sense of time , if you &apos;re going to have a sense of memory , and if you could get a sense of memories in the sense of memory , you might have to get another answer .
in the early 800s , i got a really amazing task when my professor at harvard asked if i was interested in walking to go to haiti and to film the societies that were the foundation of dumb , the general vduton and the couch poton , and they used it to make it more biomic .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people are always asking me to talk to me about how i &apos;m going to deal with wider skills , and i &apos;m going to tell you something : this phrase never fit for me , and i &apos;ve always been very unfelt about the questions of people , and i think , well , i understand why i understand it .
and now , if i translate that , for example , in which i can think of as an overview of selection , as a selection , in which all of which it comes up to me , i can look at detail in detail , and say , &quot; yes , i can also throw this somewhere in a little bit , or i can take that anywhere else , or maybe go back and buy it .
i recommend you all to read steves or look at the film so that you can &apos;t understand the wonderful connection between these two men , but also how the music connects to music , and how it was ultimately , when the instrument of this game , what this game allows us to do is to get the alminazi street from the street .
down here in the picture you see is the lab , in leadership , which is so quite a bit of a garage with all sorts of lab , the untrained , has a group in paris , which has been successful in paris , which is something that &apos;s been successful and also very interesting , because i want to cut a project like that .
no biologist would argue , for example , that 50 percent of all species are just before dying , because it &apos;s not true . and yet , this -- the apocalyptic scenarios in the biological variety of biodiversity -- which is hardly known as the most important species of all of us , known as the croaristor of the cultural diversity .
bg : now we haven &apos;t set ourselves up to a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting openness for all the nuclei names of the nucleus in the name of the great interest , and the people of the entrepreneurs in russia who were in russia , india , china , and i was here , and the empower of energy and energy , and how that would make this happen .
the computer visions have captured these images together so that they can see the real room in this room , where all of the grassroots loads in the grasslands were made into the canadian rock , and they &apos;re talking about elements of stabilic stabilizes , or amordances , and these things have been transferred to be converted to each other .
and if you take a part of the software that we &apos;ve just seen before , then you &apos;ll also understand why nine-percent of our unbelievable software or not is usable to use ipad , which is in many ipad , or in many , most of the time , although it &apos;s more classic , it &apos;s more intuitive .
the result is that -- we call it patients &quot; autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift from the responsibility to someone who knows something of someone who knows something nameless -- the doctor -- who knows nothing of someone who &apos;s probably the highest and is probably not in the best decision to make a constitutional decision .
and this idea came to me as i was in the midst of writing , pray prairie , i fell in this one of the two things that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something , and you don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be a little bit of an idea . it &apos;s going to be a desirable book . that &apos;s the worst book ever written .
so , we also have one of these same gag-aggregate in the same size that he &apos;s there , in the half-around , in fact , the complete dynamics of this network , so in the hall it looks like this , here &apos;s the light , the big batteries that are there are all this big shrimp , and we &apos;re going to simulate this network .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical nature creature , which was made by the fact that it literally lives in the walls of an attribute -- about the elizabeth , the household of the house , the artist -- and the artist , in some sense , would make the work invisible and the work would make the work .
if i want to leave you with one thing today , it &apos;s that the overall data that we consume is larger than the sum of its parts , and instead of thinking about information technology , i want you to think about how we can use information , and so that we recognize patterns , and so we wouldn &apos;t be able to be able to look at the otherwise .
so we &apos;ve done in a study that i &apos;ve done with the shlomaro and alessandro de tero , we &apos;ve done a study with the people in the people -- who &apos;ve been working for all -- and these people have been involved in a collection of the collection of their partners in the curriculum .
so , interesting historical note : as the mosquitoes brought back to high school , they brought this practice , and the language changed over the course of centuallah , lah , allah , allah , mool√© , which is still fighting to fight at officials and dances .
now , nowadays , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this -- something that &apos;s in the car real-time sensors , some sensors that have sensors from the car , and then give that information to the system to go on and then use that car to real-time and then reconcile that car and then real-time real-time things into information .
i was afraid , not because of that , but i was afraid that i could lose him in his sink , and that i could destroy his relationship to him , and that i could destroy his relationship to the violin , i could talk about smallpox and exciting skill and other exciting ways of talking about poets .
so , the fact is that , in the 20th century , you don &apos;t remember the 20th century , in 300 years of your war or your technical innovation , you will remember , but rather than one of the era that we were in , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity of the earth is either active or unacceptable . so this is not the problem .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which was the measurement of all the things in visual effects and computer generic effects in a very new way to deal with human realistic , realization of being the medicines , the medicines that had been made , and the headquarters should be all of the cg , and the world should be cg .
now , i &apos;m probably hearing , because the two girls are still there , i &apos;m probably one of the generation that &apos;s probably going to work for this bad image , because i have hundreds of thousands of u.n. , i &apos;ve already started to study hostility launches in some of the farmland , technical , engineering school , today , i think , is going to be knee .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a question with me , which was one of the questions i had in my lectures , one of the story . &#91; unclear &#93; -- he said that he would have heard a symphony , and there was absolutely absolutely music , and at the end of the room , there was a terrible chalk chase of the chalk .
you know ? i think , you know ? i think one person gets up to the fact that he thinks he is , or she is like the vessels , and the source and the essence of all the divine , creative , unknown , mysterious , mysterious , is a little bit too small to ask for the human fragile .
but my dream here is that , if you can do it economically , and at the same time , the co2 would be , the skeptic , the skeptics will say , &quot; okay , don &apos;t make me come up with no carbon , i wish that it would be true , but i &apos;m going to accept that it , because it &apos;s cheaper to be because it &apos;s cheaper than the anticipating method . &quot;
it &apos;s actually the kind of thing that happens to these choices , because if you have a patient , who , say , two mirrors , had two different surveys , and choose to choose which he then , the one that the chocolate has chosen , the memory is less and that the surgeon is chosen , the surgeon is chosen .
and you know , all of you know the healthy , when you give a secret of the best friend &apos;s law , even though this one is swallowed on you and then you get wishes and the best friend , and the best friend comes up with it , and it leads me to a bad discussion , but at the end of the bad news , you will never reshack a lot again .
you know , one of the great rivers of travel in traveling , and one of the freudian programs in the nodes of ethical research is to remind people who are still remember the old days , who are still able to feel their past and still touch the wind in the wind , and they touch a gluttable buyer , they touch the shepherds of plants .
if you ever have the chance to work in your urban center , in your urban center , like our fellow scott &apos;s publishing as part of the program -- in fact , they all do -- you will see that the government of people who are calling many different problems are in a variety of ways they &apos;re saying that they &apos;re in your house .
so , in fact , the nice thing about this is , if you do this , you do agriculture , biogas , put it on a hectare , and you can put it into the living room , so it can take about a hundred dollars , and then you get the facility and the facility and the facility , and the chickens , and the chickens , and a vegetables and vegetables and vegetables .
we &apos;re at the threshold of the threshold , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think that , for hundreds of years , we need to go back to the enlightenment to find a time when we fought to the progress in which we fought about these things , we &apos;ve now entered more than we now .
so by contrast by changing color , contrast and light on the pure images of individuals , photographic photographic photographers , such as distraction , deep disorders and color , we amplify the boundary between the images and the images that make them look like a single image of hundreds of old imagery .
now , if i put a room full of colleagues in a room with colleagues and ask their sovereignty , and i would tell you what i was telling you right now , i probably wouldn &apos;t be able to reach the end of the second story before it really unpleased , somebody would like to have a joke , and they would have the rest of it and forgot the rest of it .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who &apos;s not evidence for biological evolution , that would be a very good moment , you &apos;re going to turn off your personal communication device -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can look at the thrust of the book of castle &apos;s book , which is why nothing else is going to be wrong in this talk , and you &apos;re going to make sense of it .
a few years ago , the laser scientist was assigned to the shinya yamana for his research into a adult skin cells , a fibroidering one , and only through the manipulation of four cell , to bring it to an induced pluripotent cell -- a cell in which is popular in the cell in a cell .
and in order to show the dimension , i &apos;ve made all the kinds of batteries that are being made , for the cars , for computers , cell phones , pockets , everything -- and i &apos;ve been using the amount of electronic energy that the world uses . i &apos;ve found that i &apos;ve found that all batteries that we can now produce less than 10 minutes of what we can do .
so , let &apos;s go back to the time of the big bang , 14 years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of living space , perhaps three to four billion years ago , the world &apos;s first multi-year organisms -- perhaps as much as a billion years ago , or a billion years ago , and then the human species formed around the past .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral of cathedral , which ended the computer with images from flickr . just give them an emergency room , and they become a picture of men &apos;s images in t-shirts and shirts on the universities , and so every one of these kinds of farms are represented as a model that was discovered just as a model .
and yet , in this country , in this country , in the south of the south , we &apos;re putting people here -- is the risk of being convicted of death , is higher , when the victims of being white , when it &apos;s black , is 22 times higher , if the black is black and black is white -- the same thing in denominous states , where people are dying of their bodies .
i once traveled with a young colleague of 6,000 miles of you transmitted to china by the south doa , and when i first came to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics of 6,000 people , and the sanitation was turned into 1.2 million people , and as the cultural revolution was transformed from the cultivated yeast .
and so therefore , the idea is , if you have all kinds of different problems , something that you have to invest in , from what you have later -- and the investment that isn &apos;t so clear . in fact , the ipcc isn &apos;t necessarily the worst nic and the scenario of people in the rich world , who look at the whole pc world , and they say , okay , this isn &apos;t a big drama .
we cleaned the chromosome out of a microbes . in fact , these two sops are far apart from each other , and we gave some extra genes to these genes , so we could choose the chromosome . we could combine it with an enzymes to destroy all the proteins , and it was quite amazing as a cell , and as we added into our cell -- and these are very likely to be accomplished -- very , very well here -- and here &apos;s where we could choose that .
margaret mead , the great anthropologist said before she died , it &apos;s her greatest fear that , while we &apos;re going to go to the bottom , we &apos;re going to move around the world , we &apos;re not going to move the whole range of human imagination in a way , but we &apos;re going to see that we &apos;ve forgotten a dream for a day , and we &apos;ve ever forgotten other possibilities .
i &apos;d like to show you , i &apos;d like to show you one of the original sentences of noah , and that &apos;s from a early prototype of photosynth that we &apos;ve been working on the summer to show you what i think is that it &apos;s really behind this technology , this technology is the photosync . and this is not so obvious , if you look at the environments that we &apos;ve looked at on the website .
in some words with other words , sugar pills have shown a number of studies that have shown the placebo effect , and it &apos;s just because the person thinks what you &apos;re going to do , or the pharmaceutical type of people in the -- for example , if there &apos;s only enough patients in the patient &apos;s body , it &apos;s an effect that &apos;s in the body , which you call the placebo effect .
when one of them said no , that was the copera cattle , which made a completely compound , and i spent 10 years doing this for 10 years , trying to see if i had my great engineer to actually wax out a really neat thing to do , because all my father used to have my father &apos;s mits on my father , you &apos;ve got the money to be a kid at the window .
and i had recently come up with such an encounter that i met the extraordinary american diary in rwanda , which is now over 90 , but the whole life of their lives was in dense , and she told me that , when she grew out in the village of virginia , she was working on the fields , and she said she was going to listen to hear a poem about the landscape .
it means that a little child growing up in the process , who believes that the mountain is a pie , or her destiny or her destiny , will be a very different human being , and have another relationship with this place , or a little resource , as a baby growing at montana , who believes that a mountain in the mountain , is a pile who can be wearing a pile .
i usually think my role in explaining the people like wonderful new technologies that are going to be on the side , and i thought , well , i &apos;m here with my friends , i &apos;m really going to tell you what i &apos;m trying to do , and also try to understand what &apos;s going on here , and what &apos;s really going on with these incredible jumps , what &apos;s going to be a bit like , what &apos;s going on , what &apos;s going to be going to be so far away from the earth .
and that would be , and that would be your answer to that , that would be based on the stock market , that if you spend all that time and use all that energy to solve all the co2 that &apos;s going to suffer from poverty , which means that malaria and so forth , that there &apos;s an waste of money going on , there &apos;s a waste of money going on while there &apos;s better things that we can do .
now , these people are online to run online , but they &apos;ve gone through what they &apos;ve been doing , for example , using trojans to make money out of our bank accounts , while we &apos;re doing our online banking , or the loggers who have collected our credit card information about the keyboard that we &apos;ve collected while we &apos;ve collected a computer at all .
and again , a woman parks come back to montgomomics , where she &apos;s testing two of her oldest friends , and this older women , john cardboard , who &apos;d never been doing the montgoma bush booted back -- an incredible american people , virginia , and virginia , a white , a white man , a white guy , who &apos;s dying , dr. brown .
so , the ones and the ones that have been so close to two bathroom and said , o.k , which is easier and cheaper , and then from open source , freely available , hardware , electronics , these things are wrapped up , and now the market even to the market , and now is the cheap and the cheapest performance of these are now in the world .
and that made me think of this as another person , as my friends , under the wador , who believe that those forests would contain and hugging from the humiliation of the humiliation , and the nearest rows and the canadian sisters are the northeast , the norwester of the world , that they would contribute to their hair .
now , a week before a week ago , the national academy of academy of the academy of wire for francis native francis and wilderness , two scientists , the independent tech independent techniques to encourage the natural process of encouraging evolution to perform and lead to a widespread proteins in a efficient way -- which was called &quot; naked evolution . &quot;
now , in biology , and right now in biology , because i want to take this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , that biology is actually an information science is actually , because the n.k.p. code is a abstract code , it &apos;s not the same as computers , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s matter , so matter , because it &apos;s real matter , it &apos;s not just true .
so the bruce of bruce , a famous design researcher at the brightest university , has gone so far to say that this mass media is meant to be the book and so on , the internet , the internet , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , so what we call this mass media mass media , is our ability to have virtual earth &apos;s ability .
now , some really lucky people , some happy people and companies , and profits and profits , and profit , the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson never will let that go back to -- namely will buy the rights of the content that she &apos;s ever had , at the time , had not been a lot of content , and there was a lot of content in the first place , which would be a lot of the subject .
so , from the reversal of this phrase , from the acquisition of skills , from the idea that success or happiness depends on the challenge of a challenge , without having to experience the disability of those experiences , as though my life was so successful , because i was able to promote a possible prosthetic of a prosthetic of life , or , as i could always say , with my disability .
so , as a person came to see , and as these people were coming and looking at who was the best protein in the world , this was not a professor of professor , not a caltech student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who worked as a assistant to the clinic in a republic health clinic , and the best friend at night was the best friend of the world .
now , of course , that was just a simple trick of dr. p.m. , so i wanted to do the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the views of girls , that five-year-old girl in the canvas was going to be in the canopy . but in fact , he taught me to look at my daily practice with new eyes , so a lot of experience and a new experience of experience .
now , while i was doing this in the past year after the past year , doing this to do this , i was also trying to find in the past , and i was trying to find other societies to see if they were more likely to have better ideas about how to deal with creatively , and how to deal with the creative risks that are connected to creativity .
so we have a situation like this , where we have a situation like this , where our science continues to promote more than we have to advise these categories that we had been given to categories for i.q. categories , which were very simple to create peanuts of permissions in order to identify our daily calories , so much , as we &apos;ve imagine .
so , i went home , and i went home , and i went home with my wife at night , and i told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , if there &apos;s this technology , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use to tap your eyes , and then we should find a way of going to move , that he can make a laser , so that he can make that he can do that , but that &apos;s neatable . &quot;
so , there are different kinds of things , but the nice thing about this is that a million times as much energy as we say , a coal-fired molecule , and so , if you can deal with the problems and the mainstream , and maintain the footprints , and the cost of the potential , and the potential for the potential of the impact , so the impact on the country , the impacts and almost whatever .
from the medical point of view , of course , you can say that my legs , the laser disabled , the disability , the knee jotan and artificial hutan , to the body of aging , allow people to really use their possibilities and to aggregate their limits to them , to develop the natural fate , to speak , not to the other people , to speak to themselves , to their own identity , and to redefine themselves , to their own groups of the world , to them .
&quot; disabled , &quot; jeadvance : curves , helpless , helmet , destroyed , dumped , mutilated , wounded , discharged , discharged , disastrous , inhibit , potent , impotent , potent , paralysis , weak , weak , weak , weak , weak , bud , reaught , injured , inserted , inhibited , checked , chef , checked , checked , cheese and inhibited .
i &apos;m going to let my words go to a english scientist . humphrey daddy , who , i suspect , as he used to depict the experiments of his defense curriculum , was michael faraday , said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for human mind than the human mind , that our scientific concepts are notions , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our mysteries are not mysterious , that we are not complete , that our own conquest and that there are no conquest to be . &quot;
and what we do is we take a range of travel in the ethnicity where we take our audience in such places of such as cultural imity , that they take away from the fact that they &apos;re being born . and hopefully , they become one of the other things about the centuries of compassion : that this world has made a sense of hope for us to understand that , in a different way , we can really find a multiplurality in the world of multicity , of wisdom of all of our common people .
now , one of the things about you is that the big choice of salt address is , if you buy one thing , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and the rescue of rescue is , right ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice . and what happens is this alternative decision that made you feel that this worker , and that happiness is the adolescence of happiness , and the fiber optics that made you put it on your decision , if it was just a good decision , good decision .
at the end of the end of this amazing period , you &apos;re going to take one day out , and for the first time in your life , in the age of 18 , you &apos;re watching a sunrise of sun , and in this crystal moment of consciousness , when the first thing begins to do , when the sun begins to do out in the fine landscape of the fine landscape , all of the fine punishment you have learned , what &apos;s really going to happen in the abstract in the abstract , and it goes back to the margin , and it &apos;s what &apos;s really amazing . &quot;
in fact , what i found was extraordinary was that he gathered all the time that i had collected my entire childhood , whether i was going to go to a letter in the second grade , and whether i was going to meet the pathology of the findings of the perpetrators , whether i was down my penalty or my pencil , or whether i had my athlete , and he had this kind of exclusion of medical students to the medical school students in the medical school class , and i was going to the medical school .
and if you have people who are compelling , and if you have people who are so compelling , you have a soul , or you can say , who believe that you &apos;re going to go from the soul to life , you know , the people who are going to be so different than the soul would be like a soul , not enough to think about it , but out of it , some kind of heavier , some kind of blood vessels , some sort of earth , it &apos;s going to be very , very , very , very , very important .
so , as a computer scientist , inspired by the kind of interacting with our real objects -- together with my consultanian consultants and my colleague and my colleague at jeani , i began to wonder what if we were to use computers , instead of a computer , like a digital curator , which would be at a fingertip -- if we could do something with both of these things , and we could do it in a physical way , and we could do it like that ?
and what i would like to do is to put together my mind in the sense of what i would like to put together my talk , and in the sense that the qualities and the qualities that we have made out of the voyage of the vow age , and so that we have a little bit of machine age in the intimacy of machine , that the cyber commitment of the way we can be activated , and that we can reproduce , in fact , that these sorts of complex and actually don &apos;t actually go back into the future , but we can actually get back to our future .
and then , in fact , four years old , the young people who are being cut down in the ages of three and four years of their families and separated from their families in a world of eclipse , stone scans on the stone floodline for 18 years , and two years ago , two years old , were elected by nine years old , three years old , the pregnant women who were shooting at their mother &apos;s height , and now they were shooting their mother &apos;s maice-centris .
now , what happens when we have a delayed at this point is that at this point , javio , said , &quot; what happens when we create an unaccepted area of our country -- what if we just gave them a message of american empirical empire , a part of the american empire , and if people want to work under the canadian regions , or who can work on the ground , and they &apos;re doing everything in the united states , or from that they &apos;re usually on the planet of america , they &apos;re on to go to this particular ? &quot;
i want to end with a poem called a poem that was known by a poem by a poet named haz in the 14th century , by the 14th century , and the friend of mine told me the jacobese , and that means &quot; god , only &quot; the four words &quot; every child , &quot; god , &quot; god , &quot; god not the god , the god not god , but god is constantly telling me the booth , and he &apos;s commandle , and he just goes to say , &quot; there &apos;s always the odd . &quot;
and then , if somebody has done the mosquito , and they have this sacrifice , and they &apos;re divided , and they &apos;re all of who they are , then all of them , my photograph of the notre cathedral of all of the data , suddenly with all of these data , and i can use them as being able to use them as a whole , to use this room in these kind of meta-to-room , and so on , the transfer experience of transforming a different kind of experience , which is used by other social organization .
now , of course , since we have a massive story , but since then , we have the problem of a company , we have the problem of a company , and then we have six small group of people , that we go back to the next , and we go back to the next , and we go back to the future , and we go back to the next , and the future of my despair of this , and it &apos;s , of course , again , that this is what &apos;s going to say , again , that people don &apos;t do everything that we do .
but there &apos;s not a lot of place in the woods about the sea that &apos;s not going to be a lot of in the seaweed south or of the old titled by the old tibet , but they still have time to go through a mystery of the earth , and the mystery of the earth is not aware of the idea that you can be near as far as your truck , but as the idea that you can only exist in the human intuition , because it is in the human intuition .
so , the way that the system works is that the system develops to make it easier to make the mistakes , which make it easier to disparate people inevitably better , and enable people to do it , and it &apos;s also full support of supports , in which every health of these things , can actually be observing , in the potential , in fact , in the potential ways that it &apos;s going to rewarfare going to make mistakes , and to make the errors of doing it , and for the way that people who are going to do it , in particular ways to do it for me , and to do it to rewards to rewards .
in fact , i &apos;ve got a professor of mine , even with my professor of shrimp , who was able to bring the captain man who was able to discuss the flavor-rediscovery of the mushrooms in the 300s , about that , i &apos;m arguing that you could not be a hallucinator because in the moment where you couldn &apos;t find the hallucination in which you &apos;re going to be able to learn a moment , because you &apos;re going to be able to learn more about the hallucination .
and then , again , a book , which has been seen by many of you , many of you will know the story of the story , because , after all , a book , a book that was filtered , was filmed with robert junior as a pez , and a fox of nathaniel , the conaviation of the federal penition of the jecam , who was given by the most conservative article in the year &apos;s investigative career , and , by the way , the most conservative career of course of course of evocap .
so , for example , women used to use the legacy of the election women , for example , the women , the legacy , the founder of the founder , the founder of the founding , says that nuclear is more important than the atomic difference , and said that , &quot; we have a mother of egg , and that &apos;s not enough to have election , that we don &apos;t have the right to have election in order to have election of citizenship , which is quite the citizenship , in order to say , &quot; stop , &quot; anatomic . &quot;
now , in fact , we &apos;re using all of them , or from their competitors , but they &apos;re all used to use one of them , or from their competitors , and yet , these services are particularly common in central states like iran , where foreign service providers , because they know that they can trust more food than local trustworthy government and local food companies , so they &apos;re not local government located to local food , so they &apos;re not in their loyalty .
and i ended up with people who are interested in world-looking space , and so on , and i ended up looking at people who are interested in the worlds of worlds , and who have been interested in nasa with nasa , and who are in the nasa institute of nasa missions and the missions of violence and missile russia , and they go to russia , and they go to biomimil bias , to look at the most of the social protocols , and then , and then , in order to deal with all sorts of emitembryo , and then , we have a , and then we have a , we have a .
in my name , black men . i said , &quot; this is what i would say from the cheese to the farming , &quot; in my polarization , &quot; in my age , &quot; and i have the inhabitants to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would go to every assistant to the cheese , to the cheese , &quot; which is , &quot; my worst mistake , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , and then i &apos;m going to show him what i &apos;m going to do with him .
if you had to go back to land , you had to do it , you had to go back to the country , and you had to do it , &quot; we had to do it , the glass , the jars and the whole , the whole thing , the whole thing , the whole thing , the whole thing , and the whole trouble , the human difficulty , if you &apos;re working on a lot , &quot; you can &apos;t do it , and you can &apos;t tell somebody else you &apos;ve just done it , and you know , it &apos;s kind of like something else you can &apos;t do it , it , it , and it &apos;s not something like it &apos;s going to know that , it , it , you can &apos;t do it , you can &apos;t do it .
and wherever you look around the world , you find that these cultures are not underlying it . these are dynamic , these are vibrant peoples that are being replaced by the forces that are now being submitted to their capacity , and to see if they &apos;re in the same order of magnificent hemisphere , they &apos;re in the united states of supremature women , they &apos;re lowered with a non-lethal forest , and they &apos;re cheese and sulfur &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
if you have a stake in your life , if you have a parallel line of your life , you have a lot of your social life , but you have a lot of your life that you have , if you think you &apos;re in your life , if you &apos;re going to be porous , if you &apos;re going to have oil , then you &apos;re going to have oil , and you &apos;re going to have a lot of where you &apos;re going , if you &apos;re going to have real time , and then you &apos;re going to have oil , and then you &apos;re going to have to have your life , which , if you don &apos;t have real life with your life , if it &apos;s where you &apos;re going to have real life , if you &apos;re going to have oil and you &apos;re living , and you don &apos;t have oil and you like us , and you like that , and you like that , and you don &apos;t have oil , and you don &apos;t have oil , and you don &apos;t have real ,
