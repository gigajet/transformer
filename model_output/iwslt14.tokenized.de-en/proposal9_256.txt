thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
from seattle ...
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s the singing .
but it goes .
it doesn &apos;t happen .
yeah , hello .
we love innovation .
solar technology is ...
that &apos;s not ...
we were poor .
are they all ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
after a week .
great trick ?
we were .
a couple of less .
and he says ...
we know that .
ta-dah !
twice .
here it is .
it goes fast .
they need time .
music as a language .
that &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... not yet .
thank you .
what a fish .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
this is efficiency .
wonderful , huh ?
completely inefficient .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much .
silly them .
the only chance .
no hospital too .
thank you .
stephen jay .
three .
that was incredible .
thank you . thank you .
yeah , kind of like that .
it &apos;s horrible .
long , yes .
fantastic , right ?
the sun goes on .
oh my god .
we love entertainment .
we &apos;re going up .
where do we go home ?
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we lose them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
there &apos;s a lot of stuff .
does that sound good ?
the whole environmental discussion .
sounds familiar , what ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
that &apos;s great .
that was fascinating .
can i be honest ?
the farm is incredible .
what did they do ?
robert gupta .
this is the system .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
yeah , good day .
lento , slowly .
all of this interest me .
we can do that .
what do you say ?
not very sustainable .
yes , milliseconds .
this is our present .
they have similar principles .
yeah , good day .
good work ! yes !
just do your job .
this was the result .
thank you very much .
and she did .
so they meet .
it &apos;s essential .
they &apos;re all important .
very different .
terribly , he &apos;s exciting .
that &apos;s me .
it &apos;s huge .
yes , that &apos;s going .
flying cat .
this is the last one .
can we change it ?
these days are over .
these people earn money .
what happened here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
take them again .
and that &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know .
centers were built .
what happened here ?
but you know what ?
what was that result ?
i was amazed .
it &apos;s generic .
so they knew everything .
you could see manhattan .
here &apos;s the video .
it has sensors .
why not live longer ?
it opens the door .
a few more .
that &apos;s very good .
oh , so the one .
there is no normal .
yeah , i know .
pretty good , not ?
but you know what ?
i have a question .
okay . thank you .
i stood up to him .
players don &apos;t sit around .
so create that .
they &apos;re bad . &quot;
so let &apos;s see .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work .
what do these people need ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i thought about it .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
they use their hands .
so how does this work ?
how interested they are .
that would have been okay .
what are media today ?
you can go in .
so where do we go ?
so it &apos;s true .
how do we know that ?
because , you know what ?
it &apos;s not a country .
why do we do that ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
bg : thank you .
this is a wish .
and i was an artist .
let &apos;s call him .
not training .
and the one has to go back .
we can do it differently .
they even do it .
and i understand that .
it &apos;s an enormous challenge .
there &apos;s no food .
it &apos;s against the justice .
but the wrong things .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
i &apos;m a writer .
here &apos;s another example .
i &apos;m treating kids .
it feels great .
i swear it .
i &apos;m singing .
he &apos;s not going to do that .
thank you very much .
why should we do that ?
thank you .
here &apos;s an example .
you see it immediately .
not in the toxic .
but i kept working on that .
or before the bombs .
i &apos;m going in here .
there are two options .
we need energy miracles .
why does this happen at all ?
oh . a moment .
let me tell you .
what do you want to do ?
this is what happens to us today .
and i kept on working .
so she was back .
and so it was .
yeah , here it is .
i &apos;ll agree with you .
and why is that ?
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what would all have to be done ?
i mean the soul .
you &apos;re doing the same thing .
in china , it was different .
luckily , isn &apos;t it ?
but that &apos;s not a protection .
you have pee a chance .
does anybody see anything ?
and i &apos;ve always had .
very expensive real estate .
people were crazy .
what creates the illusion ?
my gut feeling again .
just after a journey .
first of all , confine .
i created a shoe .
yeah . all right . all right .
imagine the camera .
jk : both .
but it gets worse .
so here you see it .
thank you very much .
be a mentor .
maybe 10 times .
but it didn &apos;t .
the data came in .
that &apos;s a great question .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
it has billions of them .
did you see these guys ?
but there &apos;s something else .
here &apos;s another example .
is it even photography ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
ohhh .
and then it became international .
there were remixes .
let me wrap you up .
okay , a few more .
the answer to that is no .
just a lot of fun .
my name is amit .
he had the experience .
it keeps you fresh .
that &apos;s a great question .
is that your opinion ?
it &apos;s almost identical structure .
and it was better than that .
they did it secretly .
it has him very , very much .
here you see the city .
good afternoon , everybody together .
will i like the color ?
ooh , thank you .
some have come and gone .
i don &apos;t think more .
dk : 60,000 .
there &apos;s an old study .
be not disappointed .
the game is from 2007 .
this isn &apos;t true for emotions .
it &apos;s called paul offit .
what do you believe now ?
who &apos;s going to make it ?
first of all , we have the population .
i don &apos;t like that question .
but what do your fish eat ?
let &apos;s name it as well .
this is ahead .
the work of the paper .
but where are we useful ?
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
how do we actually work ?
... his own story .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
so what does that mean ?
now , what does that mean ?
privacy has to be .
there are online criminals .
we have three major groups .
there were still fish .
he was running around here .
and then it happened again .
i felt really good .
and many people forget this .
crisis . death . disaster .
it would be intolerable .
it &apos;s not our fight .
it &apos;s not our problem .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
why not think about that ?
we love technology and creativity .
it would be knowledge .
we &apos;re always pushing each other .
and this opens up a map .
but what do we do with that ?
that &apos;s about it .
what am i looking at ?
his name is tempt .
is it going to have my size ?
that sounds crazy , right ?
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
we need to spread the message .
most of them know this .
you also have to understand that .
you see that down there .
i want to ask you something .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
i find that fascinating .
i find that fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was devastated on the floor .
they look like this .
is it about light ?
i grew up in india .
this is the shorthand .
you see the water coming .
i had a good life .
so what happened years after that ?
who are these related ?
i wanted to keep us healthy .
these changes are coming in .
what about fitness ?
that &apos;s the exciting one .
but the key is , ...
he works like this .
and then they set up .
what &apos;s actually happening there ?
the oranges cardiac .
they really loved it .
but i felt bad .
the two one called me .
woman : supervision technology .
very scary .
what &apos;s the soul ?
we &apos;re not making ourselves anymore .
i can say anything .
he went up and down .
what else can we do ?
this is what the chart looked like .
now i come to the end .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
it sounds silly .
we were 20 people .
so we &apos;re too many .
you can &apos;t have bones .
he &apos;s the guy .
or is it possible ?
conflict emerges from conflict .
so what do we need to do ?
they didn &apos;t have books .
that &apos;s felix .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
thank you for your attention .
that was the beginning of the journey .
i was astounding .
and then everyone went down .
they saw the big impact .
first extension , second .
well , i was the next one .
let &apos;s face it -- who &apos;s normal ?
and finally , episode .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
the same thing , only bigger .
who is the most successful ?
you want the world to feed ?
i wanted to support them .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
i just loved two .
the one place is south korea .
again , you have it again .
this is such a thing .
my wife told me .
and how did that feel ?
that &apos;s what you can train .
does it make you curious ?
so it &apos;s &apos; n .
so why now hack ?
this happened around christmas .
what is this for a thing ?
so , you know .
they could have done better .
the answer is yes .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
and that &apos;s not at all .
is that reasonable ?
so that &apos;s the good news .
it was a huge success .
so they saw something magical .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
2.5 to 2.5 , great .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
but can &apos;t be a problem .
and they always say , why ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
it was just not invented yet .
now , kindness should still work .
anyone know what this is ?
for example , this perception of context .
this is a game for outside .
this is god , you know ?
but it was very sad .
so let me just remind you .
the answer is no .
and it &apos;s the x .
sometimes i get too scared .
but they &apos;re doing the job .
they &apos;re both these people .
her mother was alone on her mother .
okay , there are a few .
think about your own decisions .
this picture is from this place .
i see this plunge .
and it took 18 months .
tell me about this world .
this is very risky .
and that worked very well .
again , he showed him four .
i learned everything .
and there are hundreds of them .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there are good news .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
that really made me sad .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
but it &apos;s not that fast .
how can we help you ? &quot;
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
no , no one had ever been an opportunity .
the story is not over .
what happened that day ?
well , then we want to .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
so feel good . &quot;
they come from the artists .
i should not say that .
the power plant can explode .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
she did it for three years .
you can have this cloud .
the data was not available before .
play is not silly .
now how could that happen ?
is this all about education ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
so that &apos;s what we can do .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
they don &apos;t have the story .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
play doesn &apos;t just mean children &apos;s games .
and that was 19 years ago .
which one would you like ?
they create a episode .
they have so much uncertainty .
the data is all the time .
nobody ever said that before .
so paul is a terrorist .
and this is what he actually says .
take nothing as an advert .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what should our beliefs look like ?
this is a lot of volume .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
i &apos;m not going to do it almost .
she was back , and she was dying .
and of course , this is incredible .
and again , this is the representation .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
a autistic student .
when it &apos;s in the moment , the waste is .
so not like todex .
and this is what we &apos;re taking on .
we depend on two countries .
everybody needs a goldfish glass .
let them be its i . &quot;
people still were happy .
it was my first sunburn .
in fact , he gathered fish .
my name is brian gold .
they share their experiences with other people .
the white lines are for the population .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
he showed up the algae .
it &apos;s just technologically not .
there are four and a half thousand people .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
and we &apos;re very happy about that .
every waste is nutrient .
and so we &apos;re too many .
so the question is : how ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and it was an incredible experience .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
but there are two problems .
i started feeling better .
but , you know what ?
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
that was moreover .
i talk a lot about these questions .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
this is it , very simple .
we are in an area .
and that &apos;s what we did .
basically , they do the same thing .
this is now one of the images .
what other brands do they do ?
and then something weird happened .
you can play with different kinds of ways .
the whole building was made of water .
italy . yeah .
the morning before the game .
that would not have been a problem at all .
creativity has to be somehow dumped .
nowadays it &apos;s all too simple .
asked the nurse &apos;s nurse .
i should not do that .
maybe even in our cell phones .
and it starts with a doctor .
i &apos;m going to tell you something .
we use the sun of the sun .
these are all metadata .
because i can say everything .
it will always give you similar .
but slowly , it was going to be safe .
somehow , does this work , right ?
what do you try to do ? &quot;
beyond that , we &apos;re not going to .
what leather have we learned ?
and the shape plays a role .
you can &apos;t store energy .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
okay , that &apos;s really power .
once we started a living thing .
my second mistake was worse .
and they &apos;re suggesting a 257 .
we all love baseball , right ?
somehow , children don &apos;t do that anymore .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
they &apos;re going to become free in the computer .
because does anybody have mask here ?
and then he realizes him .
other things shouldn &apos;t suffer .
this one has the greatest effect .
the movement , to write it .
anyway , not to navigate .
and that &apos;s quite the beginning .
the truth is more like this .
do you want it to be with holes ?
this is how you can &apos;t do anything .
and his response was &quot; yes . &quot;
their family was gathering together .
thank you for your patience .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
what else is risk ?
just be you who you are .
i remember my first fire .
what &apos;s a story called ?
dark . dark . dark .
now i was trying to find something interesting .
but very , very effective , right ?
but we need the whole thing .
llemixes , yes ?
that &apos;s completely glowing .
let &apos;s get the quiet one .
hmmm , my brand ?
this is frightening .
that sounds frightening .
next : nuclear energy .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
i just wanted to get normal at that time .
so this is what i &apos;m going to show you now .
once the judge looked at me .
we can &apos;t just do that .
so i went to court .
i got a little scared of technology .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
and there are several reasons for this .
they sell certificate .
but it &apos;s not documented .
why did i go to medicine ?
it can know where we are .
she &apos;s spreading out .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i like things that are different .
i went to jail -- difficult .
this didn &apos;t make any sense in my eyes .
this is a child play , right ?
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
and this video is in real time .
the game begins -- swiss .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
what about longevity ?
they &apos;re better than the reality .
so the correlation is low .
so , look what happens .
so the dynamics really changed .
so i just started playing .
and then we said , okay .
yes , these are the data .
i &apos;m shooting through the head .
have you ever been disrupted ?
this is like learning during the weekend .
because for me , it means memory .
how and what did he feel ?
we say in germany .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
music is medicine . music is changing .
it turns out it &apos;s really hard to figure out .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
these are going to be disgusting .
but what &apos;s going to happen in the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
that has nothing to do with science .
and that can make a big difference .
but there &apos;s another reason .
anyway , we need a solution .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
so i hear it , thank you very much .
they fought the channels .
in presence , maybe two percent .
we started 15 years ago .
how far do you get at all ?
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
you know what &apos;s wrong ?
so the first step is to take a interpretation .
and there &apos;s still no interpretation .
that has to be the difference .
if you come to that , yes ?
you can show me there .
this is just the minimum .
we can recruit our nutrients .
anyone know what three seconds are ?
on the book and on the image .
this picture reminded me of something .
i find them disgusting .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
i want to prove that to you .
it was a pretty poor project .
here he leaves the sun .
this is the memory .
these rivers are taking the de .
a has these benefits and risks .
our magazines are read by millions .
lego made it possible for everyone .
privacy is not the debate .
they were genetically expressed .
i &apos;m the new doctor .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
baseball is full of great statistics .
because we live on a planet .
do we really want to go into this direction ?
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
this gave them a evolutionary advantage .
and these are the neural structures .
they didn &apos;t give the government .
oh , my time is past ?
something increases me .
now , that &apos;s not quite right .
so we measured his movement .
this is a picture of the object .
apparently it was pretty popular .
you see something fun here .
i really like beautiful clothes .
he can only use his eyes .
but the truth is far away from it .
you can do it all the time .
so this crazy story could be true .
who would ever want to wish ?
the defeat would have been simple .
her father died after her birth .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a cents .
we need to increase complexity .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
here &apos;s her marrow melting .
it should be the experience .
but then they really want deep inside .
you want to orient yourself in the museum ?
that was more concrete .
okay , you really want to know this ?
and i had to get away from the city .
we won some prizes .
who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
it &apos;s called glowing kids .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
no , i mean it really seriously .
i hold the knife in my hand .
and the goal is very simple .
i shoot my sleeping back .
architects and engineers , happiness .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
now i see greg the moon .
one billion people are going to starve today .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
i loved fish from this fish .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and this sounds very different than before .
he &apos;s been on the sixth side .
i founded a institute .
they even get funding with a funding .
the film has not been done yet .
we need to think about what marks are .
what do you do ? &quot;
i call this the jet .
we &apos;ve been waiting since 1994 .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
this is ideology , not science .
and that brought me up like this .
today , 6.8 billion people are living .
very simple , that &apos;s how it &apos;s going to come .
it &apos;s busy with a sense .
it &apos;s called the projectability project .
automatically goes to the right mind .
these are the natural things that are presented .
but it requires a lot of planning .
we can do everything again .
in a way , we think of north .
and it depends on phosphorus .
often in the third one , again .
it &apos;s longer than those other networks .
the rocks are colored .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
it &apos;s about changing values .
i started with my usual talk .
this is a very sensitive question .
i learned that from my grandmother .
now we &apos;re going to do this with airplanes .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
we didn &apos;t write these app .
and every morning i jump on it .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty lousy .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
it &apos;s a very good idea .
which one would you describe ?
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
there are also world record record .
now , what &apos;s the right thing to ask ?
the people over the urine .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes it .
the living humanitarian spirit .
she gave her blood pressure to her .
thank you , but the best one is coming .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of equilibrium .
bless productivity . fantastic !
the result was catastrophe .
and everyone in this room has to come in .
here &apos;s the olive oil .
bjn sin .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
&quot; risk is not a simple game .
in fact , we have redefined poverty .
i think everywhere there are possibilities .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about that .
we &apos;ve been running a lot of effort .
this is perhaps going to transmit .
my brother was staring at me .
these are the apple pas .
i talked a lot about magic .
who could have looked at it all ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who do you actually want to inform ?
completely focused on a particular target .
what do you think happened next ?
they have it . they always have it .
so that &apos;s a tough one .
it &apos;s actually a constant constant .
they literally set up the levers .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
most of all , if he died .
so there are two circles .
the byproduct is cleaner water .
it sounds extraordinarily unusual .
we built unique elements here .
you always lose rare animals .
she &apos;s going to touch her deeply .
he died by the story .
so here you see the building works .
they drill each other .
say what you feel .
the other one had diarrhea .
let &apos;s make a little footprint .
here you have this little mechanism .
he &apos;s collected .
they &apos;re interested in the interest of the fire .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
the students are divided into notes .
these things are logical .
and here you feel it .
for energy , this one came up with me .
i tried to understand them .
all of these generations need just a few milliseconds .
and it seems that no one seems to rain .
that i had written these crazy things .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
this is just a little less destruction .
and the curiosity can &apos;t learn .
this is also a paradigm .
an almatina , exactly .
you can see from the back to the front .
so from the modern computer society .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
we &apos;ve got to get far , very quickly .
it &apos;s about a supply of america .
they &apos;re all involved .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they &apos;re the healing countries of somebody .
we go through initiation rituals .
now look at this curve .
jokes are simply among our lives .
i encrypted people in death cells .
they were inspired to be inspired by us .
leadership , maybe some mutations .
so scott gets this fruit .
we were working until late at night .
so i followed my gut feeling .
he moved back to the silence .
now we saw the reverse effect .
fda have all applauded .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
so ... so , not so optimistic .
he shut down the distribution .
let &apos;s start with the real estate .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
they had a concept of blue blood .
i believed everyone could .
i &apos;ve never met him personally .
even cats are looking at this video .
there was jimmy kimjimbean .
let &apos;s think about atoms .
how would you describe your brand ?
we talk about cool , fresh .
and it &apos;s also risky .
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
i &apos;m a speaker .
this is usually not the route .
this is a painting of a circular .
the roof was also covered with water .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
and women argued the successes .
we can support them to be good .
look at what she &apos;s doing .
the main man forced me to wonder .
sexual reproduction is continuing to the image .
i &apos;m going to read you the post .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
that &apos;s the truth . i believe .
we &apos;re talking ancient pesis of it .
it was really quite profound .
he shaped his head , no .
that &apos;s going to happen in april .
we also get very similar data .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
the mechanism is from the lie .
but with the right design , please .
we can support them to be good .
alone , what is information ?
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
there was never before , like this one .
and even lomborg thinks .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what happens ?
and also , those sources are interruptions .
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
this is an ecological network .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
the chef had cook .
you put it like this .
this is such a tragic part .
the thing that &apos;s just been represented .
what do you see fifteen milliseconds ?
i see the dalmatina .
it may be , until it &apos;s invited .
maybe there &apos;s another view of it .
no , no , far away .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
156 nations send our channel .
they tap their connection .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
she wasn &apos;t drunk yet .
i &apos;m a man . i make mistakes .
this is the system that we live in .
but i was really worried about these questions .
and that was what i felt .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
what are these three billion people going to bring to it ?
you should be the test you want .
something very strange happens here .
and that was the outbreak of the outbreak .
i &apos;ve learned a couple of very simple things .
it can know how we hold it .
so it creates a recovery .
boston only has a full-time call center .
this is a little app .
the ufer is from another place .
&quot; they didn &apos;t let it go . &quot;
i lived in parallels .
somebody made an ancient version of it .
and i &apos;d like to read you the earlier one .
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
you can be logical and intuitive .
tell me a little bit about that part .
make it possible -- all of you here .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
does anybody know what that is ?
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
it &apos;s called &quot; i jumps with me . &quot;
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now this kind of thing doesn &apos;t exist in us .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
we can give ourselves something like this .
so the first exciting primate is .
and there are hills of staff .
daniel kahneman : sure .
everybody would like to make people happier .
also , the dosage plays a role .
and why ? genetic engineering changed .
it &apos;s too cruel to millions of people .
we have now in this country .
not even the truth will be free .
because now you can apply a sentence .
you &apos;re looking at the timeline .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
but it &apos;s not just about words .
thank you , danny kahman .
we get an absolutely straight line .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
because we don &apos;t want genes ?
we don &apos;t want companies to own seeds .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t do that much .
she &apos;s doing the process , she &apos;s understanding him .
there &apos;s a lot that needs to come together .
and what do you do with the waste ?
bad ? i was completely confused .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and then he can walk .
a particularly beautiful story , as i do .
his personal identity of the erosion of erosion .
i &apos;m going to try this for one thing .
it has to work first as a present .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
this is a annual flow of water .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
it &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
now this level of intuition is very important .
so , little-in-open source .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and freedom .
they grow five centimeters .
maybe i did it with good reason .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
let &apos;s get something else out there .
it all comes from our own pockets .
ordinary people aren &apos;t accessible . &quot;
as an artist , the relationship is very important .
here you see roberto dance .
and no matter , italy has won the end .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
but the game is a format .
thank you . i have a question .
he had 20 minutes of real music .
now , i &apos;m going to show you .
that &apos;s just an insurance technique .
it should recontain those two elements .
shake the environment , fewer trash .
but i &apos;ll get to that in a minute .
yes . it doesn &apos;t do anything else .
the goal of the film is transparency .
one language is the human mind .
it was a grouper .
what you need is a new medical culture .
alone , shame and without support .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
i think our identity is threatened .
many of my clients are very young .
my cousins around everywhere .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
here are two different jewelry .
now who is ready for that journey .
i &apos;ve got it on my laptop . &quot;
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist .
a whole cool whale whistle .
the difference is then perceived as loss .
they &apos;re building two hours everywhere .
the emergence of all the strands .
no insurance can make a difference .
there are many great books to this topic .
so this was a problem for supercomputer .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of slave family .
you can predict that . why is that ?
what kind of application i &apos;m doing ?
it &apos;s great that those number goes up .
does it not have half or a quarter ? &quot;
so what can we do about all of this ?
so basically , a translation of translation .
no tree is carbon neutral .
and further , now you see him .
the next step has been done in this communities .
he had invited a lot of natural videos .
that &apos;s just the labor of labor .
two minutes later , three things happened .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so , he &apos;s here . right ?
the solve really solves the fuel problem .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
this is one , one part of her .
it just didn &apos;t come before , you know ?
in other areas -- the world of communication .
this is my supermarket . there &apos;s no big deal .
but western governments also help themselves .
sleep deprivation is ubiquitous .
i &apos;m going to be tired of how we all live .
i said , &quot; i &apos;ll listen . &quot;
if you burn coal , no .
say there &apos;s no predictable prediction .
can you play me now in blue ?
no , we find out what &apos;s in it .
and there &apos;s a central place there .
i &apos;m sure everyone &apos;s eaten up .
that &apos;s how it says the norm tends to do it .
what are actually now archaic models ?
and the list can continue forever .
so , that was my primary motivation .
human america is new . find it more .
and the problem isn &apos;t the technology .
it &apos;s the average performance of the behalf .
we asked it , and nobody knew it .
my mom called me a few minutes after that .
monday : color is something full .
it has shrunk us in a certain way .
and then it looks like this in the rule .
do you remember the darwinian times ?
so help me give you a little bit of this .
imagine mozart efficiency .
i &apos;m happy that i &apos;m there .
the amounts of water have been devastated .
they worry about the bad thing .
man 3 : i &apos;m the museum of the museum .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a lip pencil .
meanwhile , the instruments have been evolving .
i want to explain this for a little while .
actually , it doesn &apos;t want to make any viral video .
in this three-sentence sentence , three sentences from the line .
three-sentence you know , they &apos;re still out of school .
you can zoom in and zoom out .
now , i &apos;m adding a bass .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
if not , jellyfish today .
this is the machine underneath the gene .
the new chromosome went to the cell .
they laughed more than they did here .
your problem is you have too little .
three : escalation of expectations .
the official dogma of what ?
they &apos;re just listening and they &apos;re starting to talk .
let me show you how it works .
it &apos;s a game called folding .
i call them &quot; the income billion . &quot;
we &apos;re thinking of energy today .
that &apos;s why thank you . thank you .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
you go around and you turn around .
you just have to get it as far as possible .
imagine a plane too full of too .
that is something built in the city .
second half of the normal time .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
just imagine that for a moment .
raise your hands . let me see .
maybe we can see joints as change .
dumb is not much better .
people were fighting . people were fighting .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
you know that science is not a company .
if you burn natural gas . no .
so , that really blew me .
i tried to preserve the body .
life had not changed since centuries .
but so many of them received over the years .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
my fourth technology : inspiring complexity .
the third technology : categorization .
it captures a thousand square miles .
you go in two because of them -- very simple .
you should tell me something about my brand .
it was something that we knew about .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
thursday : self-confidence is the key .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
i wanted to restore the health of a disease .
now , if you think about a piece of content .
what ? that really dropped me out .
we reject intelligent food .
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
we have forced them . puff .
my parents are 80 on the ferences .
and there &apos;s a problem with germ .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
we &apos;re talking about drinking information .
you can jump directly to a certain output .
you can dive into a particular year .
because that &apos;s really what &apos;s going on , right ?
bowl , the environment requires less energy .
this is the so-called osic model .
now look at the dalmatina .
and the last two are also here today .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
this has to go down to the bottom , zero .
but i didn &apos;t refuse me of it .
it &apos;s great , but i fell in love .
astonishingly , he was still delicious .
and in time , they can react else .
our goal was just to say , okay .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go on another item .
all of this is composting .
it &apos;s all inside , which is useful .
this is going to be done in a second .
the phosphorus problem is much critical .
anyway , they do it in the middle .
the permanent ice is labeled with red .
and if you don &apos;t , you know , dance .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
seriously -- the gang !
now this cartoon makes some of the tracks .
here &apos;s a couple of them on the hampton .
so this is how the supermarket is .
i thought i could integrate .
we still think they &apos;re original .
the three words said , do you remember ?
i remember it was yesterday .
there is a chance to do something .
well , i &apos;m drying the courts .
i said , &quot; ok , oma . &quot;
we are right in the middle of this transition point .
i work in the solar technology industry .
and let me show you a simple example .
but it has an unexpected waste .
so the point was to make it fit together .
however , we seem to be very satisfied .
we are more than we are .
scott was held from human beings .
and here &apos;s every piece that &apos;s very good .
and then it &apos;s the combination of the different images .
is it about the details or the colors ?
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
nobody has to give ideas .
motors , motors -- four possibilities .
i think i may have heard more hands .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
eeee ! no , thank you !
and this is a millionaire .
so at this point , we need digital safety systems .
so again , this is really good together .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
internal sexuality comes in many different forms .
so they go . they save the shoes .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
we &apos;ve been here for 130,000 years .
what we want is to create the future .
i &apos;m in the real life of this feedback .
there &apos;s a lot of happy coaching .
let me show you some of the ones .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
shame . complaint .
we &apos;ve become rid of what hasn &apos;t worked .
they were just like the people in this room .
my grandparents pushed this number to 70 .
you &apos;re hoping that we don &apos;t need that .
we need to be able to use more research .
there &apos;s all the footprint .
normally i would take the needle now .
there &apos;s someone sitting there who didn &apos;t have any childhood .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
let &apos;s do it as if we had a machine .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
this is going to be a key element of this .
they live with chemosynthesis .
i was totally enthusiastic , you know .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
and every night they fly back 240 miles .
every morning , they fly 240 miles to the farm .
how &apos;s the forgettability ? &quot;
natural light then offers the smartphone .
that &apos;s what no one else has done in the world .
picasso , wait . just wait .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
that the theme of ecology is a global one .
now i &apos;m going to do something else about it .
they &apos;re all back to their way back .
and they had to remove what we did .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we just signed up .
but here is what they should have thought .
that &apos;s how you can &apos;t put them together .
what do you do with certificate ?
this is alfred gonzalz .
there can be a consequence of change .
and this is very important in medical research .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
then he whispered me into the ear .
the rest of the time is october .
i &apos;m going to play with some simple examples .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
the question is why people accept that .
and i got back to the work .
it &apos;s being connected through oxygen and silicon .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
then i asked myself , how could that happen ?
first of all , i thought this was a game .
the storytelling always needs more and more senses .
and try this whole thing again with another generation .
today , a lot of people give the government .
next week , the market comes down to the market .
it has a button , on / off .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the performance .
the first is a classic , apple .
it &apos;s as i &apos;d like to be .
these things have a positive effect .
no one wanted to do something about the film .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
on the left , you see a little boat .
so i think we need to be leaders .
so we have this horrible simplistic idea .
so two pairs , every single baby .
ladies and gentlemen , their relatives .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
it was beyond the imagination .
the best one is still -- in a second .
so every concert is a different concert .
so not saving , forcibly , avoiding .
and everything is packaging or content .
i could just park in front of my house . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
they support other people &apos;s mistakes .
i put them and made me care of the treatment .
do you know how to call a 400th ?
notice two things at this curve .
and i have to say , there was power .
my mother was the youngest of her children .
at 16 , i started to illustrate books .
that &apos;s our contribution to the system .
there had to be another puzzle .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
he hasn &apos;t come out of other countries .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
i never want to be a little more different in life .
so i spoke to a conference a few months later .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- that &apos;s how their fingers go along .
i &apos;d like to show you something very first .
and of course it &apos;s made , but click .
it was summer , and i had a patch .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
and they &apos;re not only going to die of masers .
what happened is that we could do that .
they don &apos;t invest time in power stations .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put it on .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correctly .
anyway . that &apos;s what i want to do every case .
technical cycle is just as much .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge for nine .
i put him in particular .
the beginning of the tribal society is the language .
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
so it &apos;s supposed to be coming from the outside to the people .
we don &apos;t raise identity , we invent it .
it was much , and i was in the hurry .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
now everybody &apos;s trying to recognize this pattern .
he came to me and hugged me .
everybody who was so began to divide .
but it &apos;s definitely not optimal situation .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you do that ?
they would roll over the country .
so smartphones , a huge subject everywhere .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
i learned very simple things in my work .
we want something against the death penalty companies .
there are some interesting developments .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet , an realistic level of realistic level .
so for the theme of the day : financial save .
in fact , no , that was not the mistake at all .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
and we need to get much better on this device .
it was created four and a half years ago in italy .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
this is a problem that many players have .
the last three of them , i &apos;ve summarized .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
stores cut off those , lion the rest .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
all right , what &apos;s the brand envelope ?
i want to help you calm down .
both of them are survival , both of them .
as i said , amanda &apos;s our elephant .
there were no canopy signs .
have you taken all your vitamins today ?
so this was a very strange experience .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
all of these wind blows around to become virtuous .
information is anyone who makes a difference .
the only thing that had was her head .
so for him , they were only building blocks .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
this is a dead turtle .
so i think this is my brand .
i have something i want to show you .
how much would it be to live in good health ?
we don &apos;t want companies to patent companies .
and that &apos;s what i thought was incredibly exciting .
they have the flow of the water surrounding .
so , we can &apos;t do these things at all .
in the countries where people are getting money .
and what does it look like ?
we understood that the weather is global .
and in that head , the memory was remembering .
you saw it in the news .
this is a completely unsustainable pattern .
it has a molecular weight on 300 million .
everyone in my tennis neighborhood is gone .
that is , we need to get phosphorus back .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
there seems to be a disconnect .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
now she understood the advantage of the prototyping .
that &apos;s the u.s. for hundreds of years .
i believe in first place that &apos;s the curiosity .
the flamingos ears eat the garden .
these were the first six years ago .
but maybe you can also remove them .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
not everything is supposed to be composable .
if you fall in love with someone , efficiently ?
and we see that it &apos;s going through .
because it doesn &apos;t really feel free .
yeah , so what should biohack be ?
here are some people that test it .
in fact , coal is not rocket .
there are the ones that are much more spatial .
the headquarters he &apos;s right here .
i thought he had kidney stones .
and feedback loops to my doctor .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
we want to get the number of crochetes .
the silence is oconcrete .
the netherlands of dna was an interesting step .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
but what happens to &quot; fiscal &quot; is different .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the labels .
no apple &apos;s ever snuck again .
good night , sweet thylacines . &quot;
now he &apos;s going to put a tractor in the scene .
and they also feel their movements and tendency .
if your job is to dance , aunt .
so we created something like 50 of the magnets .
this is footage of six seconds .
but don &apos;t always have a bad thing .
in our own countries , we would never do anything like this .
they &apos;re going to be rare because we &apos;re going to start them .
so you don &apos;t often lose your benefits .
all of this summers are inevitable .
we have access to exponential technologies .
i remember it yesterday .
and i &apos;m going to be a character in the book .
tell me , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
so each droplet was a little bit different .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
i did my job at 95 .
so i think the basic foundations are very simple .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t be able to do that .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
we found that it &apos;s really moving very strange .
they wanted nothing to do with the project .
the answer is probably going to be &quot; no . &quot;
do you know how many people look at this tedtalks ?
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
this is something like our chart .
so you can pull the whole movement forward .
here are the results we just got .
but how do you do that in practice ?
and that &apos;s not just true in terms of gender .
i don &apos;t want to get there by doing it . &quot;
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
that &apos;s not what a person is alive .
and you say , what happens to these moments ?
... also , the domain is a role .
probably many of you in this room know about this trick .
yes , they &apos;re right . we &apos;re going to fix this .
and i &apos;ve got all kinds of little things here .
and why ? because paul vaccine made a vaccine .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
now , i understand that . i do .
the marshmallow has to be on it .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
these blocks bring us no money .
i can rotate the sequence as it goes around .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
for nathaniel , music means the elite health .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
because actually this man is not interested in any of the human being .
because without these lifespans , we can &apos;t live .
he just disappointed her and not himself .
why do i have to afford that little car ?
a phrase with its own breath .
they &apos;re barely talked about in the beginnings .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
it &apos;s kind of like an opod sludge .
the whole game is a game i have to say .
or they didn &apos;t have oliphotomy .
and all of this leads us to a big question .
they &apos;re virtual reality , and they &apos;re all without computers .
yeah , what do we do now ?
and the world in which we looked like this .
and we can navigate this very simple navigation .
if you generalize it , this is what happens .
and that was not a very difficult diagnosis .
i was a obsessive obsessive student .
well , really good , maybe a star .
wealth , not debt , which affects the outcome .
she had the last word in every family street .
the transition happens . we can feel it all .
and we use this word with this word .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and that worked . for scott .
i met the decision in the united states .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
in 2010 , 23 million times , it had been seen .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
and finally , we should be transparency .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
or are they more like a downstairs ?
what is the next thing you want to talk about .
so how are we going to see in the film ?
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve found this .
and this is the planning behind xnet .
i learned that everything is different .
each ice has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature &apos;s god .
how could it be possible that we do it ?
see , dr. kea has changed his thinking .
it &apos;s natance , and it &apos;s only natasha .
we have the passion of the innovators .
this is moore &apos;s law last hundred years .
thank you for coming to ted . thank you .
we want to create mass incarceration . &quot;
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
now we &apos;re doing this with drill machines and machines .
this is the call center for service and service information .
and we want to bring this to a worldwide scale .
we all have navigation systems in our cars .
but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
all right , let me show you a little bit more of this .
here we were , and this is the painting .
emc : &quot; you are transparency welcome . &quot;
there were lots of crazy things going on .
from the bird age of the machine age .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same with the disabled movement .
but are we going to make the best part of our game ?
8,000 players played the game of eight weeks .
so we &apos;ve got about 1.5 billion players .
you expect an extra billion player in the next decade .
but one of them is much worse than the other .
but do you know what they &apos;re not right ?
i thought we were about the poker use .
there &apos;s a connection , a respectful respect .
and then i met a little unusual decision .
so my two passions go through .
you do something which is actually a little different .
i had a relationship with this beauty of mine over months .
i don &apos;t know who you know about this picture .
i &apos;ll just agree , that &apos;s logical .
i think it &apos;s important to get one .
the question of death penalty is an interesting question .
the kid in me is really excited about these possibilities .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
al is a hydrant in the boston city .
today i &apos;m going to report unexpected discoveries .
the underwater part comes from a stone .
when i say reality , i do my photo-reality .
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
and how did you do that ? what is it successful ?
a little bit more about you , they &apos;re not .
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
services : adaptation is completely overwhelmed .
the dog ! i was out of language .
would you like attractive and confident ?
she hardly walked blue and was blue .
people in the side rooms are coming in now .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them it .
and some of it doesn &apos;t work .
so we run away , and where are we going ?
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
we wanted to design a learning tool for language .
i may have another 40 years of work in me .
do you know what the answer to that question is ?
if you want to make them hyperlinks between the images .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not perceived as great loss .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
this is the kind of educational cam .
now , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies on this .
and we learn how to trust the rules of play .
probably one of those numbers has to come close to zero .
and i said , &quot; yes , very much . &quot;
you can say things that are going on in the world .
... if you could go for a second , please show the slide .
in the same way , i think we &apos;re going to play a game today .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the humanitarian doctor .
and i went over and i just heard about it .
it also shows up on other parts of the book .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
another favorite image of me , star night .
these results were achieved by several weeks of hard work .
this player is just in front of an episode .
why do i do that ? what does it get ? &quot;
there &apos;s a program that might know some of you .
i &apos;m very grateful for the sake here .
you know , he was 35 .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of that .
my mother suffered from the boat .
these are the people who view my world forms .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the border .
we see that in all sorts of areas of human life .
and just like that , it was after three months .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent .
the main problem here is something like aids .
the logic doesn &apos;t say anything about reality .
there &apos;s a nice example of this .
then i say , cardiac , yes ?
and we are inventing as often as we want .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re going to bring children to the world .
his whole workplace has changed .
i said , &quot; promises , oma . &quot;
they are devastated and strange programs .
the politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
but what this picture is a problem .
there are some places that we can apply to .
we called it the digital water packaging .
because they have special skills of processors .
so here are a couple of natural fireflies .
the second factor is the services we use .
so my way to make films completely .
it &apos;s hard to translate the destruction .
so you could feel like you could sell it .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
that is , the ants weigh a lot more than us .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;d like to look at now .
go and quouts of leonard cohen .
so , go out and start to invent it .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
that &apos;s an idea worth spreading .
so , just two other small changes .
how many would choose for a good memory ?
and this is the story of the story .
so please listen to , if a music is played .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
the logic doesn &apos;t say anything that &apos;s true .
the first two sentences are correct .
in fact , we know that something else is the case .
now this should actually not be a joke , but it should be .
and then you do that , and then you learn the sentence .
we can do these things in different ways .
what remains us is that it &apos;s a living .
they moved to a conservation concept .
so these women met , and they just kept themselves .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and we have an idle design .
darkness and sponsors were sponsored .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzles .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you zoom in . you can actually go in .
you can see in all these museums here .
how much money does it take to realize that ?
think about it . that attack is generic .
and if it doesn &apos;t , it doesn &apos;t do anything .
so we start with a drone drone .
he says , &quot; willingness to get up . &quot;
imagine a soundscape .
it &apos;s an absolutely denial of error .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
this is another view of life .
they divided the kingdom into two halves .
this is one of the classic expressions in playing .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
we didn &apos;t have any paralysis in this country yesterday .
and i took a while to find out that .
we repeated these practice with the same students .
you have to be willing to take risks like this .
&quot; look at your business , pink .
there &apos;s no overpopulation problem .
then you &apos;ll notice that it has given change .
and the third area , which is actually explained by itself .
i &apos;m happy to talk to all of you .
each big picture is the beginning of a tar .
you wouldn &apos;t starve starvation , and you know what ?
or are they more like a downstairs ?
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
this is the consequence that we need to face .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i said , &quot; please fly in the air . &quot;
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
wednesday : surround your child .
game is the tickle that gives us both .
if you have something to give , you give it now .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
they teach them how to open doors .
antarctica : healthy , powerful , powerful . &quot;
and here are two patients . these are their records .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
i think it &apos;s true for everyone on the planet .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
so , a climate change is going to become terrible for you .
i &apos;ll just show you the new york times website .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
but the volume is far greater than ever before .
it grows in the winter and shrinking in the summer .
not just bad , but the worst of all times .
everybody knew your genius was a little bit lam .
we repair them , we repair them .
and the world in which we now see life like this .
but these are all the streets in the u.s. ica .
we &apos;re dancing in temple , and we &apos;re going to become god . &quot;
child mortality has proven to reduce a tenth .
and that &apos;s where it comes back .
now manifesto is something that a half billion people eat .
she &apos;s not even an idea ; she &apos;s a process .
and you know what my answer to that is ?
we go to the poor placebo industry .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
where is the greatest interest in what is really going on ?
and the power of energy is very important for you .
we went back to the shock of titanic .
because artists have pushed a local ratio .
and at all , you &apos;ve got a lot less than i do .
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
i &apos;m never going to play more like this moment .
it &apos;s &apos; form of real-life behavior , right ?
and less usable or use of friendship is it .
how can i do anything else ?
i don &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
so how do we work if we put in there ?
every society is shaped by a primate medium .
and these interactive portraits are taking place .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation .
you may have heard that we have waterproof .
and it &apos;s also deeply immersed in our lives .
you get a model that comes from all the earth .
the grandfather of this old man wiped out .
and she said the three words : do you remember that ?
the only problem was that they had 10 children .
so in other words , i first want to do what i want .
and i see the same process of combining photographs .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it became this year almost 200 million times .
they had 348 different kinds of marrow .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction to that .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
he described one of them as a very common ordinary .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of her . &quot;
on a feet , the screen is filled with leaves .
so the tasmanian ecstatic movement has done it .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
this year it became almost 50 million times .
but what about that day , that particular day ?
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
the faces of the audience were very seriously at the end .
i love this guy ; his unaffordable is affordable .
we should put the bear in the cage .
are they mindless and monsoon , how 2,000 ?
the living self doesn &apos;t have a vote in that vote .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
and in the world , everything makes sense for me .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
civic , in a moment of the headline .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
and no , it &apos;s not like san francisco or san francisco .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open you doors ?
here &apos;s the current version of this one-time ad .
it was a extreme situation . you needed a extreme solution .
and that was sort of the first of people developed tools .
as a consequence , we build stronger social relationships .
you never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen so rare lines .
i take this hand . and here &apos;s the knife .
and the film is called &quot; the hiv test . &quot;
well , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
how would they change their relationships and the negative energy in that way ?
now we have the mayor of the mayor .
now , we know everything about where our stuff comes from .
france makes a power . italy is a power .
how do you judge people because of their characteristics ?
now , chimps are known for their aggressive .
he &apos;s every fifth of my mind .
is it possible for others , or is it possible ?
so i say , let &apos;s start the world changing games .
edward cava on the ova is a national scientist .
we &apos;re spending three billion hours a week playing with online games .
the biggest difference between them is the transition with time .
we tried to get to the end of the highway .
bg : a energy breakthrough is the most important .
and i say , &quot; well , don &apos;t you yourself .
with pivot , you can dive into a decade .
but for many people , this is a little bit radical .
so i was living in my life with lots of fish .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
in fact , the notes are very vague and uncertain .
because we don &apos;t do things anymore .
that &apos;s where it &apos;s going to be , rather , my glasses .
as i said , there &apos;s been only a couple of thousand .
this is an interactive filmmaker .
and let &apos;s do it ! let &apos;s do it for you , despite the guy .
i &apos;m still going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and everybody knew it worked so hard , right ?
i &apos;d rather still do this work that i love .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
here is , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
the next step was to find the apps for this .
we know one more , where all the gas stations are .
so you &apos;re just going to go to google projection .
what other metamorphosen did you run ?
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brand .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
this constant feedback doesn &apos;t exist in real life .
i &apos;m going to take it for you , and then explain it .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
a semester of the subject of design interface .
i &apos;m also going to resolve , which is in there .
you don &apos;t know anything in this goldfish . &quot;
and then we have one of these great things .
in the future , most crimes are going to play online .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
now he &apos;s on the red list .
30 years ago , this would have smiled .
but i really believe that after us , something else is coming .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of these communities .
the cellular communities started to abstract information .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital thing .
but that wasn &apos;t the thylacine .
&quot; no , &quot; it turns out to be true .
i didn &apos;t know how to use that one .
she &apos;s a puzzle that will be put together .
also , expensive designers and contractor are very interested .
there &apos;s not even a differ at this point . there &apos;s no diffuse .
so this doesn &apos;t work at all for the memory itself .
our steps of digitization of life were exponentially exponentially .
that &apos;s star night , probably never seen before .
in the course of this journey , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
as a child , i was constantly drawing comic books , like this .
if we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
right now , this is our destiny .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i &apos;m not always doing things .
we were there just like this .
a 80 percent reduction in 2050 .
i was quite obsessed with the deep ocean .
so if you say , there &apos;s no soul .
by the way , this is the hardest part in my talk .
i can &apos;t play as much as in 20 years .
both of them gave me some rocks .
so much testosterone , but no response to that .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
i &apos;m going to just keep this in my travels like this .
1m is the highest thing i saw .
a manhattan project , &quot; project ? how do we get to get there ?
that &apos;s why the length of the onion is thinking .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
now , how do people die in such a hadron ?
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and you can see this green point there in the middle .
i sold animals throughout the country , around the world .
this is my meat , and i can rotate it .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio did not know that .
no , the throwing is the right thing , right ?
many of you are covered by faces , and so on .
they want to share their stories . they want to share their stories .
in both cases , surgery was operated , and they were fine .
she didn &apos;t have any treatable brain damage .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
and the fish also was lucky to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuts of language .
it was the failure of miserable drugs .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
there &apos;s even more behind there , it &apos;s still deeper .
but we know very little about where the things are going .
ok , now think of the extreme of self-motivating .
i know what people think when you see that .
ask , ask for your review , ask your evidence .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
just as it used to be on the village .
this is what happens to be called the gene machine age .
there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
they line them to the beatles machine .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental disagreement .
she was able to find a time framework for a time framework .
... it &apos;s the crowdsource of crowdsource .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
i worked in a coalmining mountain -- dangerous .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
and there he was rooting , and he was like , &quot; right ?
that is , to go back to the board meeting .
so , like a human being , you know , relax .
and of course , just like design impact on perception .
for the lower two billion but it &apos;s a disaster .
it &apos;s just breathtaking badly ambition .
lawyer : i &apos;m a lawyer .
we have an abstract abstract language .
another example is called virtual reality .
but actually , it was one of those night .
we had to do it because of the lawyers , etc .
it was called the automatically automatically rock .
in fact , inotar is a certified place .
now , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to desire ?
he took a famous photo . how did it take ?
they slowed down for none of our big problems .
we see the process that goes from itself .
thylacine ? yes . alive ? yanine .
here &apos;s a short video about what we &apos;re doing .
but you can combine something special like this .
it &apos;s really about combining different realities .
because the pictures of it are for them recommendation .
so , you know , and whales , you &apos;re in this museum .
the idea is to translate a digital security system .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i &apos;ll explain him .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
in fact , the progress of energy is based on energy levels .
this was not a film , not a hd , that was really real .
i was not there long ago with miel .
because , you know , that &apos;s a fun process .
have you ever seen a clineutral tree ?
and that &apos;s what i just described .
if you want to get far apart , go together . &quot;
it &apos;s time to accept america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
frosty , the carbon man will clean up every day .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
so i step back and forth the other way .
i filmed in war -- difficult and dangerous .
so we should get better off what &apos;s going on .
we can do the same thing with less energy .
if we make cities , that &apos;s actually a big thing .
when the child is born , it looks like a girl .
in other words , game is our adaptation .
can you imagine something that comes from tobacco ?
there are other pleasures , but that &apos;s dominant .
they were asked to do all 60 seconds on their pain .
you can just call it a few names , and people will understand it .
diphorized , rocking , child paralysis ...
this is a variant thing that was done .
now , the energy density is over time .
and it was an experience that couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
it caused immense jewelry in the control room .
this is not a commercial business , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s this little barrel , cook .
the shrimp eat the physical lankton .
and so he &apos;s going to finish his quest to finish up .
and then there &apos;s a lot of simulations of simulations .
however , that was not the case in the azure years .
the musical instrument is the extension of our body .
he lived only for three years .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
a baby needs something like a sixth of wind .
so i know some of the ones that didn &apos;t take care of .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people in the world .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone from here .
it &apos;s like asking someone to do the sun .
please follow me , because the circle will come back again .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
this is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
they go to thabo mbeki in south africa .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face it .
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds of them .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
brungio sani : thank you very much . thank you .
i have a friend who drives a passenger .
it &apos;s not just a nice treadmill .
and because we &apos;re getting older , the wind gets bigger .
that &apos;s the timeline that you fall in love with .
and we &apos;re still very , very strong in stories .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and the predictions that you &apos;ve read are serious .
there are a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change .
it &apos;s also my big , life-long love and fascination .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
why don &apos;t we buy them for us if we can &apos;t buy them ?
you have to admit that this is a huge choice .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
a few years ago , i started to develop little-living .
the sharpans describe it still as untouched .
my grandfather was during the hibition in prison .
she was a daily , strong woman , she had action .
so , in a way , the technologies are overwhelmed us .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
but what if you want to see the paintbrush ?
but my logical page didn &apos;t cheat it .
i just want to say a little bit about salt dressing .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . heart wish .
we &apos;ve also brought up to design schools .
this is the simulation of esapeake bay .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against injustice .
my uncle died of alcohol diseases .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
in fact , we are also a majority community of community .
what is this new condition that takes the world slowly ?
let &apos;s call it the animal , it costs a lot of money .
when a neighbor helps others , we strengthen our communities .
ohhhh , woww !
they always worry that they lose a gallery .
50 percent of their decisions went from nine minutes or less .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and my talk today is maintained by this cognitive relationship .
well , i &apos;m playing games sometimes with you , but not very often .
this is really the cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
open the map , jump them up with a click .
you know , we &apos;re now listening to a whole bunch of transparency .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
you could also use ordinary appointment technology -- you could use it .
one of my friends did -- richard bicycle .
imagine these spots could actually start to fly .
and i like to say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
these are the kinds of questions that we need to be facing .
i was fascinated by the elegant and beauty of biology .
and i can tell you it was a change experience .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
and this is from a economist . so it &apos;s logical .
i mean , how much do we honor from our memories ?
the more money you earn is the more money you make .
that all of our survival is connected to every single one of them .
10 minutes later , the judge poet had a break .
in fact , chyan , the judge has magical forces .
and yes , i have a job of how you might recognize it .
secondly , should have combined the same lighting way .
my mom , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
for example , this one would be completely logical .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute . that sounds interesting . &quot;
yes , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to get out of it .
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the film of statements .
and the film is going to be &quot; the doctor . &quot;
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
just that i think it &apos;s more like it , right ?
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy it . thank you very much .
but it turns out that this isn &apos;t all the time .
i mean , we &apos;re asking ourselves , why are we fighting this ?
that &apos;s a lot of deaths from maslow , 20 hour .
so there should be better at the beginning of my death row .
because they &apos;re the people who are experts for taste .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
i mentioned this to miel and he was kidnapping .
so the pinker , the better the system . &quot;
and then i get a little bit immediately , and that &apos;s unfair .
and also , what you would think about today in the spirit .
and we &apos;re going to replace that oil through other energy carriers .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
like algae -- and other terrifying things .
i &apos;m not going to tell you it because i want to use it .
it was completely closed . it could fail .
so that &apos;s what really got me right , and i wanted to do more .
and immediately , i see another pattern , which is different .
yes , this is a little bit down there .
that &apos;s why not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
we &apos;ve been in holland right now , over three years .
and if you can , i &apos;ll find some of the weird things .
i know it was the bottom of the ocean .
and that was the first time i learned this .
i study the woman print , and she was in a breath .
and over time , i collected more and more knowledge .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 , if a bat beat 300 .
in 2010 , we had just connected between two billion people online .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our current system .
and the lighting away from the rest of the book .
&quot; because they &apos;ve been holding her since this morning , &quot; he said .
we have the capital of the techno-philanthropic .
this approach is true for everything we do .
since that time , we have all kinds of recognition .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone in this audience .
now , your living self will not be happier .
and the answer is really simple . they are forever lost .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
here &apos;s a picture of a kentucky .
he has a feathers of 15 to one .
i can say the kanzi poker is a man .
we &apos;ve moved before in the so-called avian age .
this is 20 foot altitude , the size of greenland .
this is the audience that we finished recently .
there &apos;s a set of photographs here -- they &apos;re here .
but if you can do it in a foreign manner .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t get much longer .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
or want to be more , more powerful , have more power .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successfully , even though that &apos;s what i &apos;ve heard .
my great-grandparents died when they were 60 .
now , where are we going to go , what &apos;s the right approach ?
this is the kind of like all of them in the suburbs .
and of course , it can never be in germany . &quot;
one government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
and the more i talked about it , the more i should tell .
and i &apos;m celebrating a little kid .
obviously , this isn &apos;t all going to fit into my tiny suitcase .
if you &apos;re happy , you take other happy people .
players are the masters of social nets .
how can we transfer these feelings into the reality ?
this is how it &apos;s made of the same , bad team under the best one .
the fact is that those uncertainty should make us secure .
so the people in the west really thought a long time about creativity .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
one of them was that the phone never was broken .
the only thing we can predict the structure and predict the function .
a few months earlier , and i &apos;d just forgotten everything .
even who kills someone is not just a murderer .
for example , the invention of language was a small step in this direction .
and the next interesting phase of this took about another billion years .
and this video was actually finished in january of january .
each of these topics was made of many , many smaller decisions .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing the time .
today i &apos;d like to share with you circles and revelations .
they &apos;re interacting with their surroundings and their experience .
that trick can lead you to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
you know , there was no mandarin in the paradise .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
we see that phosphorus is actually critical .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting , is the vision of vision .
i apologize that i have to cut so many times .
secondly , what economists call perttuna &apos;s east .
and i think it looks so that the world looks like this .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
so it doesn &apos;t change anything , and yet it changed everything .
we have just transferred the 7-billion-dollar brand .
and let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
so , if you could do the light again .
it was a store that was dragging &apos; eden .
are you so far ? you look a little bit nervous .
and when i turn around , the fingers change its position .
the things that are only used in technical systems .
so that &apos;s what you see there , that doesn &apos;t work .
but it &apos;s the sausage of the vacuum cook technology .
they did that by degrading the land .
bryan stevenson : well , there are options everywhere .
get the fear . get the risk . get the risk .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
there &apos;s only the second best , the fire brigade .
they can throw out the scissors , where they go and stand .
it &apos;s an amazing error . it &apos;s from a nine innocent .
i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
very rarely you &apos;re actually going to end up with a rolling iceberg .
this is someone who is safe from four to 10 .
we &apos;ve used to get used to the linear things happen .
i had a 14-year-old , young black young black than mandela .
they &apos;re in there , they want to go to the end of the gangs .
and then people could eat this , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
because this is where the actual government is taking place .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what do you mean ? &quot;
and then we started insulation with the landers .
the conventional system all over the world looks like this .
i &apos;m explaining what these sound can be mean .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re helping with , asking for the people .
but also our perception , our perception of how they disseminate us .
and another example is the ambiguous systems , intelligent systems .
how many doors did the house that they live in ?
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells even good .
i believe and i have the feeling that we should teach that .
and i guess many of you have done this .
some people were disappointed that there was no poetry .
i sent them home without talking to my top .
the cost of solar energy in the last year is about 50 percent .
we have to recover the engine of government .
there &apos;s a direct back to this .
the affirmation of software in the rule for a couple of years .
and sure enough , we can find fast food chaotic .
cats look at cats that look at this video .
now , where would you put your brain on that scale ?
and what &apos;s happened is i needed a experts .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned language .
i wish i could grow up to my children .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
it has moments of life , one after the other .
and i ended up calling them a expedition .
we &apos;re talking about the tide of information flow .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineer .
this is already presented in the first year of his commercial .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
so they &apos;re moving around and making art installations like this .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
i was shocked , and then i went into the interior .
i went through the emergency department of my way home .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
i say that because i think identity is very important .
because all of these new technologies today are being fed up by themselves .
because your life depended on whether they were doing the job right .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
i knew she &apos;d come up to be able to get there .
today we &apos;re not just looking at something we &apos;re doing with .
a typical walmart gives you 100,000 products .
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical page says .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you is what &apos;s awesome .
for example , the previous example , it was about finding detail .
he said he didn &apos;t . he &apos;s going to ask .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
if it didn &apos;t move anymore , it would be buried .
would you not want to make these changes in your genes ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
again , what is the potential for us to do now ?
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own episode .
so , 10,000 hours is an interesting number , two reasons .
when we looked at what feelings do with income .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
there were no christmas trees . we did everything .
and that &apos;s not what we should do . our health system is mimic .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
look at rubber , farmers like miel .
depending on a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals ?
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not so sure .
it &apos;s impossible to say , how the photo was actually put together .
the words , for so long , his friends , were spooked now .
and we found out that there was actually a connection .
do you know how many decisions you make on a typical day ?
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
so the driving force is behind the cyber-- superpower .
i didn &apos;t bother with my wife for two years .
the pilot took the machine to the hudson river .
the revelation is the death of life .
that keeps us with the stander , and keep going .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
it &apos;s about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
you see the person who &apos;s wondering what &apos;s going on inside the inner place .
for most of my activities , i have two hills .
as it turns out , dna synthetic is very difficult .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we &apos;re thinking about our future as an unprecedented memories .
now , the memory itself is a storyteller .
what it ruined was the memories of the experience .
we &apos;re going to go to the next couple of days .
there &apos;s an incremental threshold there .
this is what happened . a team didn &apos;t have a robust structure .
a fission , but also a bird reserve .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love .
the first one , that was more like a passionate monkey .
he &apos;s very happy about this because he deceived it .
because the music is a language and a language is a language to communicate .
and most of all , first of all , is what is the right thing to do .
but i &apos;ll just do it for a little bit more curiosity .
i started thinking , i should just put the project in .
we can first look at the waste problem .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take somebody away .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
it &apos;s only too precise points to be accurate .
if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
so you can ask : how happy is life itself ?
most of you are completely ignored by the memory of the memory .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
has a single audience in the audience ever die of masses ?
it &apos;s a question of whether you can get it to zero .
you can like to test it after my talk in your immune system .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum , a lot of ideas .
and she asked him what is your hobbies ?
so again , in any store , you can get things back .
so the question is , how do we deal with these wind bows ?
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
so , for example , the environment , is less car .
and the life lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
so when i put them together , that &apos;s their interest .
am i seeing as if i could write a song ?
she said it would be like a donnist from the air .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
you put a blue on a green one , and you can make light .
but they take the initial genes .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition is going very fast .
yet , we &apos;re still on the galapagos islands .
more and more people came in because they were angry .
it was the fear of terror that was their life formal .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention to think about it .
we have a lot of cells that are not alone in itself .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
and what &apos;s below that is what we call bureaucracy .
but where would the next aed to help this patient be ?
you have to make 62 different decisions to design your car completely .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , it wasn &apos;t that easy .
almost as if we were prepared for our lives .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my ego space .
i was the only one to talk to the aircraft .
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
think of this as the point , as a flying dot .
but bonobos show us the other side of the meme .
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going to do .
this is going to affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
we found that in terms of happiness .
they evaporate their urine . they almost never do it .
normally most people start to orient themselves by the task .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
if you walk , yes , everybody destroyed the footprint .
if we overrun it , we can get a little bit back .
the most powerful climbing workers is the head of massey .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
there &apos;s a lot of magic . i don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a book .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is just going to get worse .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
because by seafood , we &apos;re basically restoring the past .
i want to end with a story that really excites me .
sometimes i &apos;m comparing the balance . a story to conclude .
i found that technology should be able to kill and not kill .
so we &apos;ve measured the time-scale again .
so today , evolution can happen in the time period of microseconds .
here , he lifts a rare day ago .
that is , we are useful , not less harmful .
we could reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i &apos;m not going to be able to take all of you on this journey .
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
car colors , the outside of the car -- i have 56 options .
they &apos;re not going to come from the museums .
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
i really like your way , sergey . now .
i became part of that day , not to die .
it &apos;s called yeeyeawful , and you can see the description .
this is the average size of a greenland iceberg .
i mean , what does anyone do with so many outfers ?
and as a general term , we can use the word for this .
so the question is : can we do this ? i think .
we all need to believe in the last things that we can &apos;t see .
let &apos;s call him miel . actually , he &apos;s called miel .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to do with today .
and then the same thing happens in a good , a good conversation .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
we take pictures of these minimal tracks .
economists call this a parallel improvise .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
this is a whole book , an example of nonprofit data .
and of course , we all share the same adaptation .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the case of inotar .
we &apos;re in front of us , like the inoty .
let me close with my own words : i remember .
innovation , creativity and development is not just from our minds .
i want to help you a very particular aspect of curiosity .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
ceos are about average . but here &apos;s interesting .
because even though it &apos;s very large , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
here &apos;s a proof that , by the way , that men are not pigs .
this deputy ran across the older black .
but i don &apos;t know how recipient people are going to be .
you go to the block and you take it as a revelation .
so in the end of the two weeks , we went back into space .
bonobos are related to our next living relatives .
the first one of these is a contradiction , complexity .
they invest a lot of their time in the construction of growing structure .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy how little it is supported .
normally you &apos;re just dancing and some people don &apos;t come .
now he mentioned the minerals of physical lankton .
i take that to the audience , consciously , or unconsciously .
you know , that &apos;s the real truth behind the origin .
but the question i want to throw up is : why not ?
and the best part is , perhaps , what gives us in health .
this is a technology supported innovation that we have today .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
wr wants to help people who were convicted of innocent .
and that means free , which means open and productive .
how did he get up to this particular way of looking for aid ?
let &apos;s jump fast to the moma , back in new york .
tempt will be part of the show , which is pretty driving .
we make androids and we respond to androids .
and if you do it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this is scandals and we should be ashamed .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple practice .
but as you &apos;ve talked to different people around the world about these possibilities .
they now have a renewable energy from five percent .
and they did this with the so-called lead-maps .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so i &apos;ve been busy looking at what is natural or intuitive .
and these are just the biohacker , the individual people .
it means that we have a cultural impact beside the scientific term .
this struck me when i wanted my jeans .
he invited the king off to the dinner .
but somehow we can do it from this problem .
and that &apos;s what i had last half a year .
but instead of crying in panic , he just stopped .
how about contributions that we can &apos;t even predict ?
if you look at the people with whom you have to do ...
and guess what in the attack of what we found in the attack ?
imagine that every single person is controlled by every single person .
okay , let me just give you a little blood for you .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
new investments to create well-paid jobs .
six : civic speakers . seven : 65 deaths .
and i hope you &apos;ll be able to play with me and play .
that means that the players of the player are safe from 10 suggestions .
a long time ago , there were gray whales -- 500 years ago .
they &apos;re going to say , well , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
the x elevator of a piece is this comparable .
from my eye angle , i saw the janitors going up and down .
fireflies in a glass of glass , i always thought .
this picture , for example , has about 10 billion points , i think .
so i decided , when i was 15 , i was to become deaf .
this is a bigger one , and this is what we &apos;re looking at right here .
and within a few years , lego went to every household .
the judge looks like him as adults , but i see a child .
and by the way , i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer .
and i &apos;d like to show you my outfungi for this week .
56 percent of all rapes aren &apos;t coming in court cases .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-assembling neutral .
i asked him how he became such a fish expert .
there was the core research leather .
from that time , there &apos;s an anecdote that you may know .
it doesn &apos;t need to whistle a rustle or sing .
and sixty-five seconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that goes far back to the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
so , i think it &apos;s a very yellow hack .
i think , sort of like , you know , you know , a little bit like this .
it &apos;s actually just taken two thousand form , and this networks , this networks .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
so , this looks like a basketball placement .
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i didn &apos;t do it .
well , in fact , the number of non-violence has not changed very much .
i first eaten it in a restaurant in southern spain .
because ultimately , our humanity depends upon all of our humanity .
it was always so inspiring , so it was wings .
the death penalty in america defined by irony .
drew the trunk up the page . went home .
by the time that airport has a surface of 100 square .
i like things that are special . i like special things .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
so maybe you should give the interview a little bit of this . &quot;
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine leaders .
here &apos;s an excerpt from this script -- code .
we &apos;ve got his bed so that it can look outside .
we degraded a man who has value for our society .
we &apos;re playing a game that suffering from the real world .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is , you know .
the secret is that play is the key to this skills .
this is actually the real meltdown of human and machine .
a couple of . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
they produced the highest construction construction in time .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of each on the planet .
i grew up with a belonging science fiction .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building clubs , not intensive .
so here was finally a company that was trying to make it right .
the component is going to become more friend who you live together with .
and i &apos;m not sure they really stay awesome .
the interesting thing is , if i can make a little trip .
there was , i think , a very good code .
in fact , nasa showed that there are many of them out there .
they like to increase the paralysis and the satisfaction .
now , i wondered how can i really get this over ?
it &apos;s an independent area . they all control mineral minerals .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view .
someone was broken and they had broken the system .
photos like this : a blueprint along a much rider road .
the biggest fear was , they were raping , rape and death .
so it turns out it &apos;s very difficult for all of these extensions .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange land .
but apart from that , it &apos;s a very good meditation .
i &apos;ve brought seven underpants in it , and that &apos;s all this .
but a lot of people get caught in a very strange position .
our gut is a wonderful hospitality for these bacteria .
now , the two ways of throwing two terms of happiness in happiness .
well , the living self-life itself lives its continual .
there &apos;s a violent wave of happiness among happiness .
it &apos;s just a bundle . it &apos;s mimic .
the modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
ah , the majority . that &apos;s what i like to see as a doctor .
my inspiration comes from one event that comes back 500 years .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
the smallpox . the pox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they are the renewables , as they are often called .
this is a fish break up in the southern corner of southern spain .
so , i &apos;m going to ask you , how come peculiar ?
the notes did have the function of the letters of one letter .
then the lash of the suburbs of the industrial cultures .
that means you &apos;re navigating about sound and about rhythm .
so that &apos;s just a application of many that you can do with it .
and then we &apos;ve been working like this for a kind of coach .
on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
should i write this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
this is what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
54 percent of the deaths were shrinking through drilling .
in essence , emphasis has become the building block of our time .
as if it were with a new sentence , never before , ever before .
how can a judge someone in something that &apos;s not ?
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lyncha , mobs .
so , programs that can be harnessed with the most nuclei .
for example , the fish had been recorded on a glorious flight .
possibilities that would not have been allowed would have been explicitly encouraged .
so i went back a few years ago to do that .
finally , in front of the prescription , we should welcome the fear .
a remarkable , march . how is your brand ?
why is it important to start ? what is the red ?
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely constrained by limitations .
and i said , &quot; how are you communicating ? &quot;
now , on that night , all of them went to celebrate the center .
and the critical indicator of that is the extinction of the languages .
and i had to explain to the journalists that there &apos;s no test .
and this is called androo recipes .
we &apos;re developing into collaborative thinking , heart beings .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a phd in torandres .
at the moment , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
and soon i wrote a paper on genetic engineering .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
so i offered a $ 100,000 price for the winner .
one day , this mirror says yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
there was no piano at the time when the instrument were still at the time .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
even if you were to shoot now , you would have emissions .
most people know most of the people from the software .
now this is even live on the internet . you can check it out .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nunavind .
but nothing was invented that would leave me again until now .
and the best part is that they connect with magnets .
some of my cute passions in the last five years .
i looked in the rains , and it was a little bit small pink .
so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in that particular ton .
and then i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
so the dramatic numbers come in at the prisons of prison .
i gave some talks in germany about the death penalty .
a kid in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey one . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know much about government , when i started this program .
this is my w.org . a very simple thing .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
what is the context of the thought and the feelings about them ?
and if they &apos;re dangerous , then really bad things happen .
and that urgency , that goal , has really changed my life .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
if we don &apos;t put phosphorus in fact , there &apos;s no phosphorus .
this piece for 50 years , the magical thing became the magical thing for me .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours a video is uploaded .
if they were able to do it , they could also help me .
and just disappeared all these companies , one after the other .
i &apos;m sad that we never know each other as adults .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserves it .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
and so when we think about it , we have an interesting situation to ourselves .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go to the house .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a different world .
specialized skills and processing skills and their combination .
the people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
and somehow we have to bring change to zero .
we &apos;re still figuring out what their rights are .
this is the timeline of most perceptions we have .
this is our youngest bester tester right there .
against march , the lhc will be functional .
and this is the message i took in medical school .
do you know how to do a 3,000-square-foot baseball baseball ?
i believe that in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
if someone likes , it &apos;s not just a lion .
and so i think the ted community should be his horse .
and she &apos;s spread to rice , of course , organs .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say thank you ted .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
now , the film has a very big momentum .
in fact , it &apos;s only a time period of two to three weeks .
these people will be connected to the film in eternal -- forever .
so all these green areas , these are the richest environments .
one is called jazz , and the other is called &quot; sword . &quot;
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of god to virtual .
i went to the car and was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
in the short period here , i realized one : ted has a ted identity .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good intuition intuition to actually lead the experiments .
in my opinion , i think , have changed our world in a fundamental way .
this is all reality today and in the future will be much more possible .
so this enables the play to come from commitment to trust , and trust .
here it says , the more you need , the better .
people said , &quot; did you have no fear to succeed ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding , but i can live with it .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely unbelievable .
i love this one : &quot; watson , human opponent . &quot;
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very seriously .
three months later , i was moved , and the adventure went on .
it &apos;s about making out of needles across the globe .
i like a lot of colors , a lot of gray notes and so on .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
we want to use that as a possible impulse for the flywheel .
and the question was , how could you connect technology to new technology ?
for example , i don &apos;t want to give the same rights as a human .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
and this is something we need to learn , which is very fast .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s owner .
man is supposed to have a common ancestry or a common ancestry .
and according to seventh , and f , ceasa .
how were his living circumstances , how were the society and the politics ?
on september 10th , last year , the machine ran for the first time .
we have letted portraits of children , and we see them playing with it .
and when i listened to her , she made utter noises .
and i was good , i did come with claude .
but if i ask you , how are you going to do this with your wife ?
you collect information about the piece in the sewing literature .
now , there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they can all be engaged .
but how about that picture you &apos;re linked with all your images ?
you say you never die the names .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other regional technology .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen before .
we should be able to eradicate everything we want .
and i tend to think of , drilling as my shadow .
and so studies have been done in order to see if this was the right one .
and you can see that there &apos;s an enormous amount of possibilities there .
the natural forces come from asia , in which they all come from japan .
because a good engineer has built a great car or nuclear plants .
that was the very first beginning of a musical expression .
you can only have nuclear missions if you &apos;re not there .
you &apos;re fine . the question is how will we go ?
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
the official faith from all the western industrialized societies .
&quot; do you remember the patient you went home ? &quot;
we live on a planet where 70 percent of the water is covered .
now , just make the building of housing against the cities .
because that &apos;s how you can just use these logic .
a lot of music lessons is that you learn how to read the notes .
that would be just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
eight : tsunami warning . breaks : cyberattacks
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
bruno guisi : mark , mark , come back , come back .
it &apos;s hardly appropriate if it &apos;s harassed to play .
so we don &apos;t have to control people , let &apos;s be little too bad .
now there &apos;s all this rumble in the great unveiling of this rut .

and this is an idea that , if you think about it , can only be fulfilled with hope .
add this buzzcar to a additional effect , and they made a linguistic machine .
i spend most of my time with people in research , prison or disease cells .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion .
for instance , as an example , the most unprecedented version of this communication is the human language .
you &apos;re a upfirm chatter ? you &apos;re something that &apos;s going to bring blood into the whomever ?
now look at what happened on this day , only by activity that happens in the network .
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .

i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
and not only that , we have used our imagination to start this world .
this is the first object you can see in the quantum mechanical position .
woman : if dan had a brand , it would be probably a classic session of the ceo .
what would you do , that &apos;s what you shoot , because you think you &apos;re always out there ?
while we fall down , i had this feeling of being human , being dying is not terribly frightening .
and after that , when i was thinking about this , i decided to defend negative energy from my life .

in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have physical guys , the social norms .
for us and it &apos;s fundamental for the attachment of relationships and the care provides .
they help with the reproduction of food nutrition , and they protect them against certain diseases .
these are our master-player player . 500 million people who are extraordinary well in something .
you &apos;ve probably heard about level of level , and it &apos;s called the power starch , or the intelligence of intelligence .
that &apos;s going to be , i think , in the next decade or two , part of the national statistic .
this is actually my meat . it &apos;s not the steam of drunk meat .
if paul in a public lecture , he can &apos;t say without armed irrigation .

here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not a new yorker , i apologize .
and the fda and the shatters recline may remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apple that wrote the fields in the last year .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much worth more than it costs to build them .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics tells everything connected .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that that &apos;s been mentioned so often here today .
that can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .
when you turn on the light , it looks like we saw it before .
imagine that the screen could just appear in different formats or bigger , in different solutions .
so i started to think what it is to do in this games .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to reach to the needle .
and what the marshmallow does is it gives them hidden assumptions .
they do that because they can follow the line line from the road land that they can follow 92 .
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re kind of like the nostalgia , who &apos;s unthinking .
and what we &apos;re now able to read in the daily newspaper , which is what you find in this third sentence .
one example from a very different area . monet has painted the erox times .
and i want to add to protocol that i &apos;ve been here for my part of the jobs .
that was our first attempt to start with the digital information , the genomphi x 174 .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique pitch of the rhythm of the rhythm of each culture .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order of this information .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it &apos;s never true than it is today less .
i thought , &quot; you know , the camera would mean we wanted to have a backward conversation .
so for example , the number four punishment is very out of this code ; you can &apos;t see it .
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just so that the architecture almost disappears .
if these slides fall down , they can write , they can write patterns , they show images , text .
our cities , in the last couple of years , were just tested with networks and electronics .
for bonobos and people , life doesn &apos;t matter , and claws alone .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this rovertical stuff like manifesto .
in order to become part of the constitution , but it has to be approved twice by congress .
you put an extrinsic administrator on the team , they &apos;re going to be better .
bill gross has several companies , among other things , called esolar the great solar technology .
one is the energy density that creates these technologies as dramatically as the power of power .
that means 15 pounds have to take fish , so you get a pounds of tuna .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s going on , because with a normal , regular electrochemical battery .
a tv set or a washing machine that you use only , that you don &apos;t need .
in a certain sense , the arctic ice score is the beating heart of our global climate system .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view , the fish knows something .
and this was an example of what our own governments use to apply our own technology to us , the citizens .
we want to have bias and discrimination in the criminal justice system .
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually have .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
and what we &apos;ve actually done is we &apos;ve done , the mankind , is we &apos;ve started to abstract .
this is because the government is continuing to the ocean , and this is the top 15-inch .
at the end of a pocket , i cook a giant soup that we shared .
something as profound as our identity is now a choice of how this slide should be .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , as long as you &apos;re not a particle physicist .
either &quot; flesh &quot; or &quot; a paradise d , &quot; you will have a choice .
you can &apos;t just be enough concrete , like this factor for the quality of life of a quality of life .
by shaping the six-ray , and it can interact next to each other , it can interact the characters .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was probably not a lack of their treatment .
i came to think of it as being educated and cameras out of it .
as we can keep them for longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times .
and the side places that are roandroids , which are the 2,000 hormone hormones .
i was the second volunteer to the brine , so i had a pretty good chance to get into that .
and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution are slow , but they &apos;re relentless .
players love , part of the awe of the decline of the missions of planetary abbreviations .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are master-player .
understand , there are two countries that are controlling almost 80 percent of the phosphorus seventh forests worldwide .
in china , a descent officer is still in honeybee , sort of , right ?
it actually took a few years to start with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
and the preparation were enormous . we had to put cameras , and we had to do everything .
but what voodoo does so interesting is this relationship between living and the dead .
because obviously , a animal that &apos;s been very common , once rarely dies before it dies .

well , i &apos;m a optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen here .
they &apos;re not fighting that struggle that we &apos;re all fighting to talk about who is going to speak ; they all be allowed to speak .
you might think that this is just a landscape , and the lower part was manipulated .
and the next piece of puzzled by four women in three generations who build a new life .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right , but you know what ?
just to give you the overview , i &apos;m zoom out so you can see what you get .
and as part of that , they created a concept from the anatomic common act .
or are we going to be able to do something else -- something that is perhaps better at the environment ?
i really hope that we play major games to survive on this planet , to survive another century .
it &apos;s absolutely astonishing to ourselves , and it &apos;s unkidding ourselves that we can afford .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same proportion to progress .
the idea here is obviously not just the machinery of the machine interface in the control room .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- actually , i &apos;m out of the socks .
this grassroots soil is not going to run with role-wide software ; it &apos;s based on a completely other technology .
now , when i was a nice college , i had my first courses .
and this is half of all the world &apos;s problems that are caused by the textile industry .
this is almost complete security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
in this country , there are children in our country for children &apos;s lifelong , with no punishment .
this is what we need to understand under cop corners , to start again .
we have to prevent people &apos;s knowledge from things , especially when they &apos;re true .
that &apos;s the only way i do it , and it &apos;s beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
now , reproductive all of the rest of it , the numbers that have been dumped the best .
his mother was locked in , as a punishment for -- for the crime of wealthier .
it kind of managed to find the time , to find english and qualified qualifications .
two , famine , in somalia , in somalia , 3 , commentary : buffy of the police .
but it &apos;s not true , we &apos;ve seen in europe , and our web is physical .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably most of america &apos;s money &apos;s children &apos;s book writer .
the next puzzle is part of how a boat is running out in the early morning in red .
this sounds very rough and sounds like very science-fiction , i know .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you a couple of questions , and i want to know your answers .
so it &apos;s probably going to be toraquerque , active fishery , a part of our future .
both of those are strong claims because we don &apos;t look at the problem just like we should .
they go in the new day , they go -- they print a woman , a woman , a mother , a grandmother .
furthermore , despite their logarithmic mixes on the left , they upgrade .
michael j. nelson from the mystery theater was one of the first ones to make a joke about this .
so we also understand each other , and i want to show you a very basic , very simple trick .
and so you can see the animals right next to a 500 degrees celsius that they can survive there .
so , in the way of shifting the liberty of the evidence that they experience the great lie of the lie .
already today , in some flat sheets in lake alaska , methane from the water itself .
for her life , she had a job : the tide of her family and a new life in australia .
and in reality , when we fail , when we go to focus on obstacles , we often feel differently .
and this archaic model belongs is that we have basically a natural relationship between virtuality .
as a kid , i had collected collections of lungs , a stack and mucks .
and so from the interest , on this technology , i &apos;m just continuing to the rings .
for example , we developed a ice sheet of ice that is at room temperature .
unfortunately , it doesn &apos;t look like the frankach , but it might be able to help the frankly france a little bit .
in high school , a student said that brian goldman would learn a blueprint for a blueprint .
i &apos;m going to put on a statistics that i hope most of you have heard of .
so when we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and like a lot of people , i thought that the government was mainly about choosing people in a office .
so they &apos;re all the tools , and the only thing that &apos;s going on is our imagination .
if someone was asking you to describe your brand identity , your personality , how would you be ?
so basically , if you look at something like this , it &apos;s impossible to do it .
because the lesson that i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let it go .
and maybe we know only from wood to wood , if we &apos;re really exposed to it .
a third sentence that appears immediately to people who have a strong sense of soul .
it &apos;s called the old-fashioned law , or the psychology that we &apos;re also influenced in perception .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re dealing with next to the actual age as an old age .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
i can accelerate the entire sequence by putting the pace in one or another .
and the question was so tangible that we decided to explore the research and the answer .
we say , &quot; computers , generic imaging a hundred million randomly selected sequences of instructions .
take methods that are easy to use , and start them with this patient , in the team , into poor people .
and i think the most important thing is that we &apos;ve stopped talking to our patients .
so maybe we sell a shoe , and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe you &apos;ve ever carried ...
why not have the fast muscle fiber optics that will allow you to run faster and longer ?
we know that as human beings , we actually work as human beings , if we do perform important work .
we know from that study that you have to reach to the needle if it &apos;s to go to the cause .
i brought you an example of the north american tribe of the nootton indian .
perhaps to have an aging understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative self .
we now have an infinite choice of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so that we can anticipate the development .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , resource , silence , counseling .
so we could just end up with dump , maybe hundreds of new cities .
when i went back 27 years later , the fish shrinked in its size of its size .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , what is this : what &apos;s happened now with the $ 100 $ 100 ?
it &apos;s almost physically impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing red pants .
do we use these decisions to shape society that is better , is the successful one that is friendly ?
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change your cells ?
this also represents the entertainment value of this speech , which is why i hope it brought you .
but in fact , my research on the institute for the future , is exactly the opposite .
nothing goes into my sleeves or comes out , no trickiness , and you can study everything .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics that didn &apos;t even have any fanatics at all .
you can see it &apos;s kind of a column , often called the &quot; migraine reactor . &quot;
i remembered that last year when i brought mosquitos , and somehow people liked that .
it &apos;s important for the ages that most people have in the first semester , the great laws .
40 percent of all the people around the world get half of their drinking water from this melting water .
that &apos;s great . the tube didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
the viral particles were then passed away from the cells and came back and killed ecoli .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve been paying this long time to the choice of our common choice .
so , you see , all of the cases , nobody has to be an obvious candidate .
most of the incarcertiland in this country didn &apos;t actually find the great crime in the world .
this endum is going to promote the money that &apos;s going to invest in more security forces and security .
police officers came together and prohired government policies and bureaucracies .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could have ever written by hand .
so , for me , photography seemed to be more like walking around the right place at the right time .
and this sadness really formed in a thought that i only wish i had one thing .
and by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since his , as i have to say , very successful .
you don &apos;t sit around , you turn around . there &apos;s always been something important to do .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we need from our experience to be a story .
do you say there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that have different things ?
this is the deadline that has given us the environmental models that we need to think about .
and also , even though it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need focal fuel -- you &apos;ve got some parts .
you tell me that they &apos;re not actually going to bite , in fact , they &apos;re not going to leave the glass any time .
and so many people come and look at this because you can see what problems you get .
she heard about this book by charles darwin who was the origin of species and the tribe of man .
i adored my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
evolution is all about the continuity of genomes to the next generation , adaptation and generation after generation .
i found the time that i spent on this hospital just great -- up to my physiological therapy .
now , if i ever opened the folder with the 600 images in it , i would have spent another hour .
people in their faith , and it &apos;s so tight that you can &apos;t free it .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve turned it into a workshop .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor that seems to be a little hard , but maybe that tells us about us .
this is what we &apos;re seeing here again , the oil , this is all over again , the individual gate .
overview : now interacting with the object , i can sort of zoom out again , zoom in .
now , first of all , sounds is really excruciating , if you &apos;re closer to it .
because often people come , they can &apos;t use the user , so everybody can deal with it .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of scrabbling and boggles .
if we think about biological processes , or some process to replace that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
if you break the goldfish glass , everything is possible , you satisfy the happiness .
if i &apos;m in a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about .
but finally , i decided to wear my god , i have to go to the dish and wear this crazy incident .
and finally , there was a study done with ceos in which they observed a week for the ceos .
so we &apos;re missing our brains , because our brains are simply not accepting that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
i got another gift , which is to see the future , and come to life differently .
that means we have a common ancestor , a evolutionary grandmother , which lived about six million years ago .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember it . &quot;
so we have the memory itself , and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
unfortunately , that &apos;s the whole good news , because there &apos;s a couple of other problems , and they &apos;ve been often mentioned .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much energy in our energy lives without changing its lifestyle .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i only got two years later two years later , when we moved to california .
so , you need to be used for learning process of music for at least as long as the spoken language .
so we had to develop a new method with which we could put these little pieces together , and we could correct the corrections .
we &apos;ve been able to quote about a hundred genes of the 500 or something like this .
and this really raises these ideas to restrict these limitations for the space on the screen .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species have existed for 600,000 years .
because in this context , we start to grasp the truly amazing things that make us apart .
we &apos;ve developed an app for layar , augmented reality to find these aeds .
there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m going to tell you about a knee that works on the wirelessly .
we use this great euphemism , try and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the start .
so if you &apos;re lucky enough of the species itself of maximizing , you &apos;re going to end up doing very different things .
as peter told us , she was not only the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all of us .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil .
we hope that that no pop-ups and other nonprofits should be -- that should not be necessary .
the grandfather of the man was not afraid of the arctic night or the weather storm .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced , or 75 stones for each person on the planet .
and to win , the device has to diagnose a better diagnosis than a high-quality team .
the founding fathers were from my view of the original anatomic activists , which is why .
they were playing a custody game , and they were allowed to break down the victory .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions , that &apos;s the scientific method of scientific method .
this would have been around without the world demand , but it would have been much more important .
certainly , i would never achieve an alien world with a spaceship , which probably seemed to me .
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
well , just to close , i want to realize that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
who knows if the movie comes out , maybe we &apos;ll see a hormonal coming out of the film .
what are we supposed to do with the fact that we are merely vary by a few nucleode ?
it feels like what i want to do , where i want to go and increase my strength , and then take off .
but if you &apos;re in a epic adventure and said , &quot; let &apos;s get the oil out of it . &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we &apos;d never known before , because we &apos;d never known that human potential .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon will die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
in the rich world , the millions of us have not yet threatened , hardly yet .
so here we see a very basic service . there are lights at home so you can read the homework ?
the greeks called these gods of divinity of creativity of creativity .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch them go into the next century .
and what we do is we install a evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s running in the microsecond space .
so in other words , the future of each year is shrinking a year since i &apos;ve been on this world .
they &apos;re shooting the decision -- they &apos;re shooting at you , even if you &apos;re interested in your own best interest .
so these kinds of things -- you know , people reminds them -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
if you surround yourself with the right people , you &apos;re not going to understand it , you &apos;re also going to appreciate it .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said that they were doing this model right .
one way that &apos;s particularly interesting is , and what i &apos;ve been used a lot of time is evolution .
last year , we had a team of lower-locally in the boston access to &quot; code for programs . &quot;
so , imagine if you were at the same time in multiple places , how would that feel ?
obviously , it &apos;s with a very simple virus . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
so the nerve cells are the information processing employment , which has built these cellular communities .
so it was possible for us to put the little digital head through the torture of the torque .
echinese eaca , a little antioxidant to help you on the springs .
no , the lie , i &apos;m talking about , that has to do with it , that it deceives itself .
when professors become curious , they will often shrink them into research like this .
this is what happens to be the machine age , and this is the book , and this is the photomy .
and it &apos;s about playing with a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first one with the fuel of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
it turns out that it really meant , &quot; we want to have nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
in the moment it was like a film director had a director of a spinal cord .
this is the way i would say , if i was like to say goodbye , it was only three times the rate .
and the main lesson that we learned , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
but there &apos;s no forgotten , where we can look around , where you can learn how to make fire .
his cause is to write the piece , it &apos;s going to be more and more of my personal run , to play it .
but these concepts of the cyberages , which bring us back to these possibilities again .
so these tweet lays out longer to survive , and they fed up in solitude .
so then just like those words that we use in the language of the politically correctly .
the first example of what many of you know and some of you appreciate , very few of you don &apos;t need at all .
instead , go to the doctor and the doctor tells you , we could do a or we could do b .
i want to tell you about this mechanism today or something , which is probably unconscious .
so now , i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , i &apos;m dedicated by artifact .
but here we go , if you have a evidence to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
for example , in bach , there are 20 percent of the garbage of the trash between wind .
but , again and again , very rarely , something special happened . one of the perpetrators was actually oversecured .
my heart , i was so devastated while i was trying to figure out what was going on .
the human part of this book , far from the end , of course , is this what we &apos;re most interested in .
immediately , you &apos;re going to be able to do it for granted , for example , which can &apos;t be done .
they have reinterminated the demographic of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
so people who think of evolution as a gene , at the time , will have a lot of biology changed .
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re made by the mind . how can you get harm ?
for those non-engineers , little-living material became a material , electronics just became one more material .
so what can happen to three billion growing , healthy , productive , productive members of the human community ?
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is indisgusting , but also very timely .
and every time it divided itself , the chemicals have spread to the exquisite chemicals .
so i would say there are three simple rules to make possible to achieve a realistic result .
so i wanted to create something else that begins when the process is erased .
and if you take a picture with a camera that ends up when you put it on the lion .
however , my interest in photography , when i received my first digital camera , at age 15 .
the rotor is this moving part of the centrifuge , this black object you see .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break into 20 portions , as you know from documentations .
i spent a lot of my life trying to be , trying to be myself , and to adapt me at the same time .
but not only that -- that merely melts and melts , they connect with the universe and other devices out there .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the most urgent world .
there are so controversial things like this all of the genetic engineering plants that are pointing to the shockers .
if any of who had built a 2.5 instructions , he would have contributed the cost home .
i met mr in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney hall .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far you can take a piece of the future away .
every year we &apos;re losing three million tons of phosphorus that really would go back to circles .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated as if i &apos;m going to go undercover .
you can go and create your own museum , and create your own museum -- all of these images can put your own collection .
so , in the big and whole , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have what the goal is .
well , one epiphany is usually available for whatever you find , because you fall somewhere .
so the idea is that we actually include people with the people in which they do things together , collectively .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the head of the development department of a nonprofit organization called robin laden .
it &apos;s about how satisfying or joyful is when that person is thinking about their lives .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay here in the present and now .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused , they &apos;re really confused , and they really make a drunk .
because the soil is going to die off the mosquito , and the wind and the water picks the soil off .
so that you are being tested as citizens in the situation , with these scientific technologies .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a small explanation of what you see .
this is one of the images that we &apos;ve been looking at with the so-called gapield technology .
now , the film with the sundance film , we can look at this time .
and every time i interviewed somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
pollinators are born as calm from a glacier , or break it out of ice .
so in this project , we actually designed some little markers to track the trash as it goes through the system .
our language has been solved by the social changes that have been solved in many cases by a technological change .
but danny , in the entire american quest , it &apos;s about freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , it &apos;s something that needs the world now .
about a decade ago , i wrote a paper about vaccination for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , but once we see how different teams .

remember , when carl sagan moved the voyager-vehicle spacecraft back in 1990 , when he moved back to the earth ?
and then my friends , who shall make little movies , &quot; well , how should we compete with these big , gigantic hollywood competing ? &quot;
what they had come back was an anatomic concept , and they put it through another , which was radical and beautiful , 200 years for us .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you look in italy , like the people in the high bow coladosis out of the car , and you can see it .
a country has already offered his supreme court to provide court for the court cases of dissemination of the legal system .
and i was amazed to resist , based on resistance , which is what is most effective in the history of humankind .
i spend most of my time with the socially flawed in the social settings and in places where there &apos;s a lot of hopeful hopeful .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every advertising agency that we talked to , has their customers , has left the fingers .
she loveled the playground and decided that atoms were seen , the common countryside , not the differences , and that was very radical .
and in the end , we &apos;re really standing in a choice , and we want to have a monomatic monotony in the world , or in a kind of comatic world of diversity of diversity of diversity ?
and so , we knew that if we wanted to see that piece of metal going into space , we &apos;d have to take all the time out of it .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s the environment , it &apos;s the highest , isn &apos;t it , right ?
we &apos;ve digitized almost 20 years , and when we sequenced the humankind genome , the shifting of analogious biology around the world of digital computer .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of a pure , if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning , that the most extraordinary aspects of your life are coming from you .
so , to buy a new jeans after many years of the gene , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to buy a few jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
so to give you a sense of this conversation , i had to know something about this remarkable , of the doubt and voodoo is not a magnet of magic black .
and because there &apos;s nothing more important than our survival , the first half of all this information is a part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
and the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got from most of the feedback or where i had the greatest success , those are the things that i interacted with .
now , i don &apos;t want you to use a lot of time , because , if you imagine the whole time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
you have to cut two things : to be the medical fact , to be amputated and to the other social opinion , whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
the basic idea of that dee company was to overcome the phase of the analogies with visual areas and translate right now with digital production .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to take the data on a usbc -- the way we saw it in the middle .
and in this way , the critic is actually the critical variable that has a memory of the self from a living herself , and it has very little impact on this story .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life and when that is , people are making mistakes from time to time .
and it will allow people to measure from home their blood pressure , to send it to their doctor , and to share it with others , to something more than 100 dollars .
so the first case : all of the species that are made of atoms that are made of every piece of metal and then at the same time , the same time that the atoms go on and off .
when i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t have a full of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about making a life full of possibilities .
but nevertheless , dna evidence indicate that the useda , later , the roman empire , the same dna as the old poetry dropped .
how do you increase happiness very differently , depending on how much you think , and whether you think about the memory , or whether you think about life itself .
but if you have very cheap stuff , you can put it up for 60 years -- think of a column that &apos;s buried without the whole complex .
we &apos;re going to turn it on and expect data in june or june juli , and use our journey to figure out what the stones of the universe are .
we want to create the world of funerals , the inventors , of the work , because these world we live in , these interactive world , belongs to us .
imagine this device . in a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease and 1.3 percent of the health staff .
so i decided to go one day to visit the liter , and i asked the ladder , &quot; this model , &quot; do you offer people all these opportunities ? &quot;
the head of the constant came up and said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but we might look at the tedtalk .
we need to have this conversations , and we need to think , but if we &apos;re going to get into the time machine and go into the future we &apos;re going to be happy to have that .
so i stood back with a small team on unknown terrain , and we turned down , &quot; avatar with a new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
and we haven &apos;t been able to do that , but that &apos;s actually me , right , i think , has been pretty good about getting people right there .
i mean , it can make strange claim that a thing is at the same time in two different places , but they haven &apos;t been born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is what it takes to take us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; to a ta-day moment .
but the measurements quite beautiful , and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not yet capable of creating this .
i was 10 seventh when i went back to one of his courses and played the last four of balchopin , a later .
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at everything for you , everyone knew that you had this embodied embodied embodied embodiment that you had .
in nine people that we have executed , a one that we have been devastated for innocent , who have been laid out of death and death row .
so an organism could learn an example , a certain fruit of no food , because it was bad , and it made the last time it eaten .
i personally think it &apos;s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to compromise with your ideas in your head .
it &apos;s about how to encounter people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and use them to generate a satisfying experience .
after all , this older black man came with a very troubling dish machine in the courthouse , and almost drove me out to the defense bank .
there &apos;s this airplane made out of hundreds of thousands of little bits that work together to make their safer flight . don &apos;t you see this ? &quot;
one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in &quot; thylacine in my trash . can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s dead .
and just as a woman who wanted to know me as adults , met me , turned around in a box filled with my hands .
we will have a process that will take place in the rule of 100,000 years , and we can put it on a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-oh &quot; than other moments , and some of them are the worst fresh wreck wallpaper .
that is , we &apos;ve seen the projief that we see before we see it , and then again , back to our device in the back , to say , okay , okay .
its task is to create the conditions which are less than a billionth of a second after the universe -- and to 600 million times a second .
but they also have a secret secret for our future , a future where we have to adapt to increasing challenges , through greater creativity and print cooperation .
and many discussions i &apos;ve had in the last six years were similar to the discussion i &apos;ve had in the last three years to photovoltaics .
a season , if you make the filled with water , the pressure enough , so i think it &apos;s four to six inches on it .
and something interesting happened , which was what was going on in jacques cousteau &apos;s shows , which was a very unknown world on our own earth itself .
and our european web is basically just taken from louder rotating mammals from big fuels where the wave is all around europe .
one process that -- like everyone who knows it has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everyone in this room doesn &apos;t always feel reasonable .
and every year we ask the students to create business , products and services that can live within a decade of the lives of large-scale people .
i &apos;ve come to the ted stage because i believe many of you have understood that the moral pension of the universe is far beyond that it is the justice of the book .
and finally , saturday , one , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world about one , without saying a word .
they didn &apos;t count because he was lined with a memory ; the memory was incorrect , and the memory was all he had to keep in mind .
i think that the molecular biology now is general , so very generally speaking , my biotechnology , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology , and so on .
how about loving the oppressed , wherever you are , to give a voice to make your attention and make change for the first time ?
i love to find a different colorful , crazy outfit , to be able to wear , and in the last time , to photograph and to photograph .
i told my wife every time a human being used in a moral conspiracy , because we should try to replace it by doing this .
and it turns out that when you do it , it feels a little bit concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people more .
so we &apos;re not only responsible for getting the people we love to keep the fateful sales , but they &apos;re also providing good to get along with it .
so we take something very complicated , we turn it into powder to produce a sequence of notes , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we are constantly getting the jealousy , the other ones that create when they are firmly .
now , in egypt , in egypt , the insurgency representations of the egypt of the egyptian police , and they found a lot of action .
and after one year of planning , two weeks of work , of work , of course , did cloning and performing , tony was recording , first seven years after seven years .
so that &apos;s what this reactors was a problem that we &apos;re in our filling and that &apos;s being reduced to be dramatically reduce during this process .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point of view , we have digitized the biology , and now we &apos;re trying to create a new code in biology by building new biology , and building life .
but this is what keeps me up at night -- one of the things that kept me in the night . we &apos;ve never had scientific adjustments in the way that we &apos;ve ever had before .
according to burrenta , the premier was in january , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls from this film .
yes , this is a giant debate in the moment , from coal mining , because we don &apos;t , or don &apos;t gaze , because it doesn &apos;t go .
many of our friends thought we were pretty dumb to do this , and we came back and all of the pictures of the graffiti were crawling .
and i &apos;d be happy to tell you that my worst mistake was only in the first five years of passive what i &apos;m saying , but nonetheless , nonprofits .
but these apps are like little digital memories , that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of the government , the taxes and travels .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very exclusive full-blown scholar , at least then he was really exclusively .
in a country that has just been launched a recurrent crisis in which this congress was voted with an 124 voice .
it seems like we &apos;re right from the other parts of the tree , but actually , for most part , the fundamental mechanisms are our cells pretty much the same .
but the logic of deception allows us to do it , as if the first sentence of foresight , you would have to take it for granted without proof concept .
it &apos;s over and over again a very happy concert , if i have the experience of experience that i &apos;ve been working as long as i &apos;ve been working like new .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists that i told my talk about , and she said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing , so you talk about it . &quot;
well , there are marks and marks about these things that come and go and play , but a brand is quite strong , one thing is pretty strong .
and if you &apos;ve got to say that the drug is incorporating it &apos;s complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the data is a science for you .
if i tell you that someone has taken his life as eight to 10 times , they &apos;ve got a lot uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self-assembly .
now , i spent some people in the company , and no one could give me an answer , until i finally got the rhino biologists .
basically , you get every round of the six-year-old at random chance while you &apos;re trying to form words , and you &apos;re trying to figure out those words about a dictionary .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel some more comfortable , or maybe a little bit less likely to talk to you about it .
but then another thing happened , very interesting step , where the things were completely different . because these cells started to communicate and share information , so that cells started from cells .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that is , we say , climate .
they stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all they &apos;re tired of flood , and they &apos;re poisonous , march .
we have now , from our discoveries from around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i &apos;d like to believe that the design components of the future are .
ladies and gentlemen , what i believe in our future is the fact that we have more than individuals to make the big challenges of our planet .
so one app that &apos;s written in a couple of days , and then it spread from selfish , is a kind of like the bug bug in the institution .
what that means is that if you were to meet someone and say to you , oh , his father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about your size ?
and at this point , if you look at laughter , how important this lie is , and how much time you need to be able to experience something that is very good for us to share .
how it would feel to live in a world where the german state left people , especially if there were not many jews of the jews .
and because the government ultimately drives us -- remember , remember , &quot; we &apos;re doing the people ? &quot; -- how do we think about how this change happens .
are they reliable , stable , stable family , sectarian , safe , holy , considering and how the dalai lama or yoda ?
this is ayashuasca , which many of you have heard of , the most powerful psychoactive parties from the perpendian of the shame .
and a lot of times , i &apos;ve worked with internal people who are looking for their gender , so people who aren &apos;t the average male or female guy .
that &apos;s what we all had to do then . when we took children as a book , we took the description of the tape , and we put them on the screen into our minds .
we came up with music . and a few days later , i got an email that was interested in nathaniel &apos;s books for me .
and since we &apos;re at the median campus , the virtual reality is that we can put virtual reality in our v.r.r. lab , and we can actually do this all the time .
i said , &quot; well , you know , you &apos;re going to have a thing , and i &apos;m going to know if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , it &apos;s not my fault , right ?
because it &apos;s as much meaning as anything that i &apos;ve heard from , when it went on to explain the end of the creative process .
so it &apos;s so far . and for those of you who were not there at the time , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever done -- in diameter of diameter .
and i argued that we might be able to create a new form of cambrian explosion in the massive open education based on this digital design .
the reason that was once better than anything was worse than anything was worse than everything was worse , it was possible for people to make the experience a surprise .
and i was with myself that if i had my efforts to double perfection for perfection and never again a mistake that the voice could forgive .
so these are just a few of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but they can also be the last six days , or the last six years .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew i &apos;d found several months to plan them to find the different places for the puzzles of the puzzle .
but also , because it turns out that by using these all the time we actually play the wound , we are able to change people in the situation .
i can now bring the notions that the bach has had , on the modern wing , to sound what a diamond can &apos;t do .
already , out of english can be transferred to english , more knowledge to it , once you ask it to do it , or even poetry .
bg : now we need one of those scalable , generous things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years .
if you &apos;re also playing , you &apos;re looking at some nuances here , which are looking up at the top of your eyes and your mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show up .
you &apos;ve got to imagine that if you &apos;re doing something of the classical commodities , five hours of this new kind of natural software just one more time .
i &apos;m a wall . i have to work with , i have to stand up every single day , and sweat me and really feel uncomfortable .
so they invented , according to herbs , the designs , the designs and the united states had a national strategy , and on a day you would eat . the next day you would play .
the other note is that we use the zero emissions technology , whether it &apos;s in all the developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest of it .
the movie studio , i sold this as &quot; romeo , &quot; and julia ship on a ship . it became a love film , an passionate film .
so far in discussions always try to make these insula , which is the lane that has a little grid , and that has nothing to do with our connected and nothing to it .
and so we decided to build mountains in berlin a hall , in which we can sort of form the electric impact on the scale of one in three very precisely .
that is , the interpret has to interpret these inexhaustible lines in language , which is another concrete , concrete , non-verbal music language .
and the intuitive user has not only been a basic factor of economic factor , elementary factor , when i &apos;m just using technological devices to people .
many journalists called me on the question : &quot; what are you going to do , who &apos;s going to leave us , whether or not farya or male or male ? &quot;
now , what i hear is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing that &apos;s wrong .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them together to play a kind of game , to control their health better .
and imagine , even i had a five-year-old child with dr. p. and so try to stop this practice , without natural success .
bg : well , the actual spending for the research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion more per year than they &apos;re doing today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that we &apos;re constantly interacting , and the unexpected expectations that we &apos;re creating are the real nutritional nutrients of creativity .
and there was no video games nor this oversaw with computer-generated movies that had all of the language in the media , i had to create the pictures in my head .
as you knew in the village , who had what happened to whom with whom and when this is happening today , this extension of the extension of the extension of our own mobile devices through those mobile devices .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking away that i was so hand-led , and so i would be able to provide my patients without even contact him .
i got a ticket because i &apos;m not on the bike , but there &apos;s a bicycle that doesn &apos;t drive on the bike lanes .
and so i look at one of the people in common with most other experimental quantum logic , who need a good logic to bring the complex ideas together .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he &apos;s in his &quot; i have a dream &quot; solution .
jacques cousteau came to our living room with his fascinating enhancement that gave us the animals and a world of wonder that we never could have imagined before .
and if we succeeded , of course , we can do this for nike , for nike , for the mauritz and the whole textile texture with the textile industry .
in each step , we created these pieces of glass , so we could sequence them because we tried to create a very robust process of what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
in another part of the conversation of the 20th century , the community of our community is to be part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or making something new .
my wife , my kids and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspirations and archives our archival home .
we can go further and look at the data and then look at the data , and see that circular disease and cancer are the usual suspicion , but not everyone .
ninety percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the tuna , the height , the slaughter , are collapsed .
over the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has doubled more than doubled the inflation of average income per population has tripled .
one of the areas that we see in the pdaniel , in our culture today , in the united states , are the fighting over and the end of life .
now , this is good , except that paul &apos;s going to walk around and talk about vaccines and how valuable they are , and that &apos;s what people should just stop talking about .
the second one is a lovely experience of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s between his life and his life and his life with his life .
you go up in this capsule , you get in this dark dark , hostile environment , where there &apos;s no hope , if you don &apos;t get it back .
so from that point of view , you also notice that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only from that defendment to the idea of being , yes , that &apos;s a hundred percent renewable .
it was recognized in the cell , and the other chromosome was recognized as the material of the digestive and so we ended up with a new cell with a new chromosome .
and these scientists have just documented the various topics with which these ceo is busy . and how much time they make decisions that are interacting with the themes .
everybody thinks i was between titanic and avatar , &quot; avatar , &quot; and i &apos;d have gone to the searching somewhere on a towel at the beach .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and they should do it , because that love story , like romantic , is also staggering .
my first memories of this boat -- the stealing of the engine , the clap of a wave on the bug , the empty and horizontal .
and if you &apos;re manipulating the speed of this rose , you &apos;re actually able to hop into the red bar and actually let the furious blows down .
it &apos;s the living self , the physician , the physician -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; it &apos;s now , if i fiber up here ? &quot;
now , when we go on and look for ages , we say 40 years or younger or younger , we see that even the main cause of this is to worry about the people .
we should call them what they &apos;re called , a geoff at the bottom , a gear , a quickly , the ecological capital capital , which allows them to make this production .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use co2 that can just be stored into productivity traces , converting co2 into the fuel process to drive this process .
so when i started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
if people take this line seriously , i would say it &apos;s all the way up to your head , all we think , for example , in terms of politics and so on .
it depends on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and the way that the opposite would be the first ever before and predicted .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the crew and design -- what we did was we actually started out in the company -- slowly .
it looks something like this , who doesn &apos;t have a willingness to have a freedom , and can &apos;t be picked up for its actions and responsibility to the responsibility , and it &apos;s so unsustainable .
so i &apos;m going to have more life expectancy than today , and so on my palette , the music has a lot more nuances of color , and emotion are more sensitive than today .
the also happens in an artistic aspect with biological materials , and yes , electronics also combined , and combined it in quite right-handed ways .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat oceans , is so fascinating to life , as we can &apos;t imagine .
and then the jellyfish connection , and the abundance that &apos;s out there , is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic network .
i &apos;ve been asking a question about 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices , which is a deadline in an american day of 70 .
a couple of weeks later , the firefighters got a letter from the household in which they used to rescue the rescue of their households .
the food that &apos;s been eaten by a chef or a chef , needs to be eaten and not only cheated or digitized .
they should be discussing these innovations , and they would be smiled by the ridiculous funds that will be provided for these innovative approach .
and if you want to go over 20 , three percent renewable renewables , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn off the oil .
and then we have a natural v.d burning smoke and dropped the burn laser , and then tried to focus that camera on this camera .
of course , the chance of randomly elected instructions is that , by the way , they are not going to actually make instructions of instructions .
that is , rather than individually , we &apos;ve been able to remember the very common , spread across macommon patterns of memories that we can hang our personal memories .
and yet , the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkable cosmic technology that you see here , everything changes .
so that &apos;s what i sent home , mixed with me a quiet voice in my voice , trying to say , &quot; goldman , not a good idea . &quot; not that . &quot;
what do you believe that the average performance for a cardiologist or a nurse or a nurse , a friend who should be a rescue ?
this is a people that don &apos;t cognitively distinguish between the colors and the green , because the sky is shaped by the forest that people depend on is equal .
and my love of science fiction appeared in my environment , because back in the late &apos; 60s , we were studying the moon and the deep sea .
we see many , many gigabyan digital photographs here , that you can get off unlocked , as you can remove , in some way , in a new way .
this tribe , the coke , have 17 varieties of huaasca , which you all recognize in the forest of the forest for our eyes as a species .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole idea of advertising is to present your product as many people as possible to see it as many people as possible .
and in this community , one recognizes that the most important thing is that you can tell from one another , because you &apos;ve got a problem that you can explain in a different way .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are aimed at the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not at all .
that our system also has a sanitation , which is that we &apos;re going to make 20 percent more efficient , and we &apos;re not going to go through the other things .
we &apos;ve only got two years of phosphorus , and now it &apos;s being used by the phosphorus minus a lot more in the environment than it is used in all atoms .
we predicted that , in 10 years , the decline of the civil rights of the civil rights is going to be as high as before the election of the legislation .
and there &apos;s one generation that &apos;s grown to the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to build the systems right .
and as far as the isolation goes , as we &apos;re giving species as a distant planet , it &apos;s going to be isolated , and the changes in the environment could make natural history .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but now i &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to have to have a director , a leader like a shield or something like that .
and after a very short period , it had lost all the characteristics of the species , and converted into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
well , i hope that you agree with me , that the players are resources that we can use to live in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
now , please bring all these randomly elected instructions , all of the programs , and come out of the closet , which are my next one . &quot;
these are two very different units , the living self , and the memory of itself , and the advocacy , and the two of the change is different from the point of happiness .
if this device enables you to sequence or dna virus , it &apos;s not known , it &apos;s going to prepare the health community and obstacle a pandemic at its outbreak .
now , if you calculate it , people will actually buy six times a glass of marrow , which they had six choices for choice , if they had 24 to choice .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , in a place where there was a pause , a recurro , who said , &quot; paul , we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
but for over two weeks , we programmed , we went to the beach propagate in venice , my kids were involved , my dog , and we created this .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the ancient greek historians &apos; historics , you might know this story . the story of how and why games have been invented .
but i think , in this frame and with the intent , i &apos;m going to make some disappointment , i &apos;m going to just leave the needle out there and go from the stage .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try to look out , whether it works , if it doesn &apos;t do that , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
a lot of arguments . fishermen with the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take untuna . big part of it .
and because they work a lot harder than we are , and because they &apos;re only talking about three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , they &apos;re in the energy consumption , they &apos;re three-and-a-half billion people .
so if you take the system as i &apos;m taught it , and you get all the error policy-making health care system , then the end is no longer left .
i think the remarkable thing that happened over the last few years , the last decade , is that we &apos;ve been changing from a physical world to a digital world .
so gender is really complicated ; internal not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a way , you can spread across the entire bandwidth , across the entire bandwidth .
and by the way , we go around and we mix and mix and mix so much that they can &apos;t say longer , that isolation is necessary for evolution to find statements .
of course , the stories i was looking for , from the science-fiction , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
and in this scenario , imagine if you &apos;re in a case , in a case , the sperm is a chomosom wearing the x of the chromosome .

now , when i look at all these people , i know that the majority of them are government officials . some of the science is still coming out of the economy , and here &apos;s my chef . and one comes from the music .
i &apos;m studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve just been studying a few years ago now with the biohazard , and that &apos;s what i started , because i just wanted to know and i wanted to do it , and i wanted to do what i was doing in the theoretical table .
and i left the medical school with the impression of that , if i knew everything , and i knew everything , or at least as close as possible , to how complete it is possible that i could make the immutments against the errors .
and if i go one more step further into this kind of intersection , where i have a voice , per se , per capita , and i don &apos;t have to control the cursor , i &apos;m faster , and i &apos;m even more immediate .
that is , i &apos;ve actually missed them right now , that they &apos;re not seeing a pattern in the middle of it , but i &apos;ve seen it within a shorter period of time , again , to see this dog in this fork .

so what we &apos;re seeing here is when i &apos;m looking at things , i can get them confusing on the right-hand side , where i don &apos;t know what salts are and pink , or i can sort of design them , by showing things i &apos;m showing .
and what it turns out is that if you put a placebo in a white pill , in the form of an aspiration , that &apos;s just a pill that has a pill , the white pill , that has a particular effect .
the carbon evolution of the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid decline in the science of power and therefore we have refrigerators , we can produce materials , we can create modern materials and so many things .
we took the lights off , we put it in a vacuum , and we cleaned the air up all the air , and we almost got it to the bottom of the piece of the metal , which was free to act like it always wanted to do .

when we get to these really big pieces -- they &apos;re going to get over 100,000 base pairs -- they &apos;re not going to be easy in ecoli . it &apos;s going to increase all the current molecular biology . and so biology is how we go to other mechanisms .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a outsider , a new lumber , new picture -- not just ok , but something you have to be grateful , maybe a gift of the boots .
and so i get a lot of the city from a very different view , a completely different kind of view , which i see , is hard and positive , a city , and so on , this way , a very different way , virtual map , from a very real city .
but that &apos;s the most aggressive thing that can happen , because this is the forensic , forced to help patients , because this could be devoted to obesity , or patients to smoking the smoking .
as i said , i &apos;ve been in the course of the years of a pretty horrible situations , but nothing could have prepared me , nothing could do to dress up to something so difficult and so endangered with these guys in a room .
and this is very amazing , because you actually believe that this technology , which is where you encounter the kind of place in the future , but in fact , it &apos;s so much the future that we have in our archaic rocks .
and because i was born with legs , and my feet were lifted to you , and i only had a few toes , and one of these toes had been overwhelmed by the other foot , the strangers had to bring the strangers to the bad news .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remind myself that i was going to talk about 20 years ago when i first talked about this , i wanted to be the same kind of anxiety response .
if we &apos;re in a game world , i believe a lot of us in our best version of our best version , and we &apos;re currently right now , are willing to solve the problem , to try and figure out how long it takes the suggestion to try again .
and there &apos;s only one of these little devices up because things should always be more intuitive , more and more natural use , and there &apos;s something you have to look at , which is , of course , what &apos;s really good for people , what is friendship or intuitive .
have you no fear that you &apos;ve ever had your life &apos;s work for it , and you &apos;re never going to be able to run on a crummy dreams -- your mouth is filled with the bitterness of the bitter &amp; amp ; d ?

imagination is inquiry , and with this phrase , i &apos;d like to close , and also to give the clues to the extent , designers , to come up to new solutions , and in this sense , thank you very much for your attention and please .
and i know definitely that it &apos;s for me -- in my situation , very dangerous to start , this dark path of sort of pulling me off -- especially in the circumstance that i &apos;m in my career right now .
the older black man stood up . he looked at the puty puty , and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come here to this young man , say they &apos;re not going to go out of the eyes . they &apos;re not going to exist . &quot;
so , the problem of cooperative online worlds , like warcraft , is that it &apos;s so satisfying , as any one of the episode , that we prefer all of our time in this game .
later on the day i went to this site with mid guel and i asked him , &quot; i said , &quot; for a place that seems so natural , &quot; as any farm i &apos;ve ever been on , &quot; how do you succeed ? &quot;
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate an event that the arctic ice diamonds , that for three million years , the size of the 48 states had taken 48 percent , to shrink 40 percent .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles of philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young black men , in prison , in prison , in prison , in prison , or in abandoned condition .
immediately after that election , between the 21st and the 24th february , a traveler of about 30 hunger to the two places that were most interested in the world that were in most of the business of the building .
the last example i have time to show it , is a musician sequencing room for legendary stores that we &apos;ve developed recently and in the business as a leading voice , how bass , bass and cass .
and we started making pieces , starting with the fifth grade -- to unveils sevened letters , and put them together , and put them together around 24,000-letter letters in order to pull those together , to 27,000 .
they empowered us to tell the story of the neuromarketing , as we tell the story in this film , that we use mris today to save the lustan centers of the brain , both on advertising and advertising .
and so i started thinking , and so i think , in the past few months , as i was working on the book soon , it &apos;s going to seem as the dangerous , scary , expected danger of my success drowned .
both in my profession , robin laden , as well as in my side occupation as a volunteer fireman , i &apos;m also very generous and friendly , but i also see the next set of love and mutual love .
suppose you live in a specific remote area , and you have a beloved lit with a cardiac surgeon , and you overcome this doctor with a cardiologist whose trajectory that is representative in 200 locations .
but when i took him , and i asked him why he was doing this intervention -- it was highly surgical operations -- his answer was that , in his country , these kids would be treated very bad , and therefore he had to do it .
and of course , when and of course , the intuitive thing and how i can take it as a little bit of an impact it is , so the things that you use as a user friendly , so they &apos;re intuitive because you &apos;re fun and you &apos;re just using it for fun .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those of us who make mistakes and those of us who don &apos;t do them . the battleys , the constraints , and the constraints , with the bad results and the good results .
there &apos;s also three big problems . the cost of doing everything in high-regulation countries , and the question that you really feel is that nothing can go wrong , despite the human labor , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work because we &apos;re afraid of this is a real snow , and it keeps millions of people out of the bloom .
now , to decide not to buy any glass , it &apos;s probably good for us -- it &apos;s good for our silence -- but it turns out that the decision-making , also , with consequence , is very much making decisions .
i don &apos;t have to do these things at the same time because the corner is always going to be a different kind of crazy , colorful , punishment of the outcome , just waiting for me to love if i have a little bit of hearts and find it .
so that &apos;s one of the effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end up with the outcome of the election , as if we had the opportunity to choose between other possibilities .
this is a photograph i took in the northern part of the baffin islands , when i took up with ucla on the whale hunt , and this man , aya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
and basically you can look at this , you know , when a tyranny of the memory , and you can think of the memory as one , which is the living self-assembly of the living experiences with the experiences that don &apos;t need for life itself .
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , then i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people go up and i listen to all these things because i don &apos;t want to leave you , or frankly , they said , they disappear .
in the rich world , in the top billion , we might be able to do a lot less and less use , but in the average , they &apos;re going to go up every year , and so more than double the number of which the services per person will be provided .
i met these people from grey , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface , and then to draw a laser laser pointer that &apos;s just regions the surface .
so what this means is , if we look back on the back of what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place of human evolution , and , most importantly , what we see in the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a set of possibilities .
so there are big challenges here . there are challenges in transmission , and when we say that the energy source is outside the country , it &apos;s not just the technology that you have to deal with the risk that the energy comes from anywhere else .
but , as we think , the only kind of biology has a huge impact without any increase in the cost of food , or the limitations of the availability of availability is when we see co2 as an output , and therefore we &apos;re working on these cells to go on .
i started working on this , scientific literature , about how these furious futures are built in natasha , and they found that they were structured in structure called kaas, and each cascade contains 164 different fuels .
now the fascinating thing is that the pockets of tape , the annihiles in the elevated , mao inhibitors are exactly the same way that the drum is to erase the tamines . so they ask themselves .
this is a problem because the global warming frogs are frozen to the arctic ocean in which there are huge amounts of carbon , which , if it &apos;s on microbes , from microbes to methane .

but we don &apos;t even listen to each other once we hear something like that , because we &apos;ve been talking about these kinds of things for a long time , so we kind of have the idea that we have this notion of age-scale light and acceptable creativity , kind of , kind of course , and of course , art -- at the end of the elderly .
and what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve actually been able to use a new kind of network that was used all over the world -- this is a mobile phone web -- and anonymity information from this network that &apos;s designed to use the neocortex from the nectar , to understand how the city works .
and then the renaissance came and changed everything , and we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s take the human center in the center of the universe -- about gods and mystery . and there &apos;s no room for more mystic , which is taking the feathers of the divinist from the divine .
in our wish , people are protecting us from the heart of the heart , and the kalashance of the truth about their medical imagery , or even a prosthetic quality to the quality of life that we have to expect , we don &apos;t have to make sure that someone is actually disabled .

because we have this self-esteem , this sense of being great , tribal descendants , not from a kind of like this , from something so unbarrel like a organism to a organism that exists to an extent , and that &apos;s what the unfair thing is for us .
and that &apos;s when you &apos;re all of your feelings about politics and the work for a long time , and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about , government , in the core , in the words of tim , in tim of tim rilly , what we &apos;re doing , we can &apos;t do that alone . &quot;
so that may seem a little bit counterintuitive , so i repeat it , so it can do this : if we have problems like poverty , climate change , global conflicts , and obesity , i think we need to try and play online for 21 hours a week to play at the end of the decade .
and our goal was to be , we wanted to get down to seventh 20 percent renewable , and then still remains here , the rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , which is going to be very expensive , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work for the batteries of batteries .
but we found 17 of branding spots who were willing to unite this control , who wanted to do business with someone like this , and to tell us how to do this , and then tell us the story to tell stories that we couldn &apos;t tell -- the stories that would never support .
but actually , you &apos;ve been thinking about this for a long time , but you could never simulate whether it &apos;s going to work , but since then there are modern computers , you can simulate it , and you can see that , yes , with the right kind of materialistic approach , it looks like it &apos;s working out there .
but the process and the heavy amount of climbing that he gave him was a blurer when he took out of the genius where he didn &apos;t have anything as a physicist , and he left him where he came from . he realized that it didn &apos;t have to be an older thing .

and one day he looked at me on one of my papers -- these practices were just buried and dengue -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , you &apos;re an army , you &apos;re so strong , you &apos;re a powerful , and it &apos;s a young girl , you &apos;re one day of one of these rice .
and the wind and the sun and the burglar load and the result came to the outcome , a very relaxation of the fact that you &apos;re faced with the conventional system , which , after twenty years , is about 50 pounds per kiloon average , it takes about four cents to happen .

filling all the crops on the plant , eating shame , harmful affairs on monocultures , chemicals on earth , on the fish , and the whole time the whole era has just been asking , &quot; if we &apos;re feeding people more cheaper , how can this be ? &quot;

now , these maybe a modern contract contribution , and if you do it as a better one , that would be great , but my core point here is that we have to work on all those five , and we cannot give them one of them , because they shy us all , because they have the significant problems .
and where you can see how far we &apos;re away from , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , at all , we can see that they can see that , for example , a program , has four to 20 units here , right ?

&quot; cloud-computing &quot; -- something that my friends at autodesk &quot; authorities &quot; call &quot; sensors &quot; and sensors , robots , 3d printers , that enable personal production on our planet to democracy , sync biology , tribes , vaccines , digital food , medicine and engineering materials and artificial intelligence .
look at this amazing demonstrations : voodoo alarm in a holy state , the light bulbs without burning instructions , an astonishing ability to affect the mind of the mind so that it &apos;s when it &apos;s in an extreme condition that it &apos;s being replaced .
and that was the most surgical form of a déjvu , which i &apos;ve ever experienced before , because before i go to a corner , i always knew what was going on in the light of the vehicle , i was going to sleep on there , and i was filling the movie of the movie , we took the movie .
in this picture , i have a bush menu as a center of the desk in all directions , because if you look at the tree of life , all existing existing specifically of that branch in particular case of evolutionary success : it survives the environment ; it has its environment and its strength .
and so with this premise , with this premise , with this premise , then , for example , brian declared in england tried to put a minimum coeval cow , a cow , and a cow , and a place , yes , has collapsed and so on , it works , and then bacteria grow .
and then just came out of the do-it-bed bio , the founder of this website , and he said , &quot; we need to meet us even now , real , and then two lovers , he has organized a conversation in london , two thousand , 10 thousand , soon in the u.s. , and in this case , san francisco is san francisco , in san francisco .
this equation has four factors . a little bit multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- the direction you want to take is zero , and it &apos;s dependent on the number of people , from the service that every person on average , every average person on average , on average , on average , on average , on average , on the energy level , on the energy level , on the energy unit , is getting per unit .
and the realization of president lobo was that , in a sense , the wisdom of the wisdom that i thought about was a way to get the foreign investors to come and build this city , that could be equivalent to all the parties in honduras for the many years , the fear of suffering and suffering .

a group from ankara , who i &apos;ve learned a while ago , who have learned a college student , who is a group that wants to communicate what she wanted to be in school , and who were learning on the street , to explain what was going on in ninea .
there are 175 dresses in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 extra barrel in italy , and 12 balance that you could buy in one large number of desalination sales , in which case no one in the 175 store is right for you .
and that was really , really , really , really bitter , and then you get into the stage , just diving into the picture , where i asked myself , 10 years ago , marathon , which was , yes , at that point , was lovoting , obviously , of course , that was so great .
and what i &apos;m going to do first of all , as quickly as possible , is to show you the basic work , a new technology that we have as part of an exception a year ago , which is the segon channel , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can either have a huge amount of data with huge amounts of visual data .
if you &apos;re the first one , if you &apos;re a kid , as a baby , the baby is that you care about what disorders you have , and depending on where you have your parents allow you to play more or less , and to touch , your parents , the more curiosity , the more curiosity , the more curiosity , of course , the more curiosity , is your curiosity .
i mean , i think most of the eyebrows of our life -- and i have the exclusion -- you know , the psychological prescription is about three seconds long . what you know is that in a life , there &apos;s about 600 million of them . there &apos;s about 600,000 . most of them don &apos;t leave any discriminate .
bill gates bill gates : to run the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the big scientists we &apos;ve done , just a few million , and even if we &apos;ve done our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s reasonable , it &apos;s only one in the 100 million .
and this really works , this will be done in the academic process , and then we thought , okay , well , maybe we &apos;ve taken that down , then we &apos;ve taken a webcam that has taken the smoke , and then we &apos;ve taken that back up to the rubble , and then you &apos;ve got a microscope , which is about four times square .
if i show you 600 magazines , and you put them into 10 categories , or i &apos;ll show you 400 magazines , and these 20 categories , then you think i have given more choice and better choice than i &apos;ve given you that i &apos;ve given you the 400 of the 400 , if i had given you over to 600 .
friday , it &apos;s friday friday , friday sun . god goon , you know , goon . &apos; &quot; before , &quot; the goon freeway , &quot; -- friday frightened . &quot; she said , &quot; you &apos;re not thinking that these conversation , without talking about this video , i &apos;m hoping to hope .

the neolithic revolution that brought us to agriculture , and that was what brought us back to this moment of saatrician , who created the poetry of the shame through the priesthood , and the archy and the hierarchy and the hierarchy and the hierarchy , and the only 10,000 years ago .
and that is , if you focus a laser , you can put a room in the room , then you can catch little particles in the air , or in the liquid , and then you move in this focus , so that &apos;s where the air is going , like a toronto is basically like a toronto is basically .
it would be great if we had this paradigm of thinking about the normal paradigm of the possibilities , or the strength of the strength to even a little bit more dangerous , audacity , so we could put the forces of the very many children , and invite them to bring in a special way , to the valuable society .
you know , michelangelo , when michelangelo liked the moglove , it means that he took the end of the hammer and took him on moss -- in fact , they can still see a little site down under the top -- and say , &quot; oh , chnunk ? why don &apos;t you play it ? &quot;
but if you &apos;re in today &apos;s 2011 , you &apos;re going to buy a new color laser printer printing the printing press , and you know , print out a page , and then you have this page yellow blob on top of every page , you print it in a pattern that &apos;s clearly trapped your back and forth .
now , my colleague at the time , with the sabid , you might be able to tell you a lot more about what &apos;s and the many other wonderful things that you can perceive with , but i &apos;d like to talk about the second part of it that we &apos;re discussing the beginning , and that is the concrete of our grassroots .
now , the problem , the problem-solving -- the problem is that even those of us who have the sympathy for the difficulty of the innate , they have as an orgguian and colorful , they somehow look at the past , while the real world is reviving us , our world , is continuing .
and i &apos;ve tried this in my lab , and i &apos;ve tried a little bit , and i &apos;ve been doing a little bit of a bifurniture on ebay and i &apos;ve been doing a little bit called n.a , trying to do a bite , and so that &apos;s how we &apos;re doing so , you know , you know , bioma is going to be doing a second time .
and if you were to choose , and if you were to choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two types of self , and you have to think about how you choose this conflict , and that &apos;s not really obvious , because if you &apos;re thinking in the sense of time , if you &apos;re thinking about that , and if you think about it , if you &apos;re in the answer , you could have a different memory of memory of memory .
in the early &apos; 800s , i got a really amazing task when my professor at harvard asked me if i were interested in going to go to haiti and try to film the secret societies that were the foundation of duvalier and couton , and that was used to use the venomer to make it safer .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people always tell me about how i &apos;m going to go with wider circumstances , and i &apos;m going to tell you something about this sentence : this sentence , never fit me up , and i &apos;m always very uncomfortable in order to answer the people of asking , and i think , you know , why i understand why .
and if i &apos;m going to translate this now , for example , in which i consider the oriental view of selective selection as a choice where everyone comes up to me , it &apos;s too big on , i can look at it in the details , and , yes , i can go somewhere else , i can also buy the computer or go and buy it .
i recommend to read all of you , read the book , or watch the film , so you don &apos;t just understand the beautiful interconnectedness between those two men , but also how music helped the music , and how it was finally the instrument , when the game was allowed to be able to get the doctor out of dwarf .
this is at the bottom of the picture that you see is the laboratory in leadership , so it &apos;s kind of a garage with garage with everything that has , the unmighty mies , a group in paris that has been involved in what has been going on , and it &apos;s pretty interesting , i want to cut a project .
no biologist would say , for example , that 50 percent , or more of all species die from the extinction , it &apos;s just not true , and yet that -- this apocalyptic case scenarium on the diversity of biodiversity -- which is barely known to us as the best aristotle on the planet of the diversity of the cultural diversity .
bg : so we haven &apos;t yet joined a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting openings for everything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear names . there are big interest and people of the company in russia , india , i &apos;ve been here and i &apos;ve talked about the power of energy , and how this fits .
the computer visions of algorithms have held these pictures together so that they have real space in which these photographs that were all taken near the sladder in the canadian rigorgeous rock , they see the elements there of stallas or vital amoration , and these all these kinds of connections were put together in each other .
and if you look at the software that we &apos;ve just seen before , then you will also understand why nine-percent of our software doesn &apos;t do it , or b it at useless i.e. i.e. , which is the i.e. , or in many areas , in many i.m. , is the same as the classic software .
the outcome is -- we call it &quot; patients &quot; -- it sounds like a good thing , but in reality , it &apos;s a shift of responsibility for making decisions about someone who knows -- the name of the name of the name of the doctor -- who knows nothing to someone who is sick and is probably not in the best position of the best choice -- to make a patient .
this idea of me being saved as a prescription in the process of congestion , pray , i fell into one of these pit doubts of the two rock that we all fall together when we &apos;re working on something , and it doesn &apos;t work . you think it &apos;s going to be a disaster . the worst thing that &apos;s ever been written .
and we also have one of those same aggregate in the same size as it is , where the half-lies , are actually the complete dynamic behavior of this web , so in half of the halle , it looks like this one on the back , there &apos;s the big batch here , there &apos;s the big battery , there &apos;s the rivers that we have with .
and they believed that a genius of this kind of magical magical creature was believed that it was literally the artist wells of an artist &apos;s studio -- about the way in which households the households -- and the artist &apos;s work , the work , in a very unacceptable work , and the result would emerge of the work .
now , if i want to introduce you to this thing , it &apos;s that the total data that we consume is greater than the sum of its parts , and instead of thinking about information overlap , i want you to think about how we can use information , so that we can look at patterns and see the trends that have not been visible .
so we &apos;ve been working in a study that i &apos;ve been doing with shlomo and alessandro , we &apos;ve done a study with the people -- the staff that worked for all of them -- and they &apos;ve been in one of the collection of their retirement partments for their currency .
and what &apos;s interesting is historical footnote : when the mosaic spanies brought along this footprint , and the language changed over the course of centuries of allah , lah , allah , lah alalallah , cooline , who was still fighting , you still fighting the alongside and bath system .
now , if you want a race , today , if you want to win , actually to win something like this -- something that &apos;s in real time , some sensors that have information that &apos;s made from the car to pass that information that &apos;s on to pass it on , and then you &apos;re going to use that car to change that car , and that &apos;s going to change things back in real information .
i was afraid , not because of the fear , but i was afraid that i could lose it into a sink of its sink , and that i could destroy its relationship with the violin , if i started to talk about anxious and peargal and other forms of diddaddak &apos;s realm .
so , in fact , the fact is that you remember the 20th century , 300 years from now , it &apos;s not for the technical or technical innovations , but rather than an era in which we were against and the destruction of the destruction of the biodiversity and the biodiversity of the earth , either of the earth , or the acceptance of that is not the change .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; the measured measurements in visual effects and computer-generated effects in a whole new height , should be realizing with human expressive expressions , expressive capability that had been made . and the main cues should all be , and the main world should be the cg .
i probably listen to the two girls who are the two girls who are still here , i &apos;m probably listening to the generation that has been devastated for this bad image because i &apos;ve got tens of hundreds of thousands of seventh code , already since i &apos;ve been studying machine gaps in carlboard , engineering school , means it &apos;s called the high school , i think , today .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a fragile response to one of my readers , who was a story , &#91; unclear &#93; &#91; unclear &#93; -- he said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely a picture of music , and at the end of the word , there was a sound of the sound of the sound .
do you know ? i think i think there &apos;s a person to allow for a person to think that he or she is like the vessel , and the essence and the source of the divine source , creative , unknown , mysterious , mysterious , is a little bit too much responsibility to give a sense of a child , the mind .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time the co2 , then the skeptics say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in that carbon dioxide , i wish it &apos;s almost going to accept that , but i &apos;m going to accept it , because it &apos;s a cheap idea , because it &apos;s a cheap idea . &quot;
it &apos;s actually the one that &apos;s going to make the decisions , because if you have a patient who &apos;s going to say we have two reflections at two different surgeons , and decides to choose what he is , the one who has the memory that has , the memory is , the memory , the memory is bad , and this is the surgeon that &apos;s picked up to the surgeon .
you know all the joints that when you give a secretary of the best price of your prize , even though you disappear , and you get the best friend and you get a friend of mine , and you get a horrible conversation , and you get a terrible discussion , and when you get that kind of bad , you &apos;re never going to make a mistake again .
you know , you know , one of the great paintings in the travel , and one of the things about the ethical research is that people live in , and the old days are still able to remember the old days , and the past is still figuring their wind in the rain , and they &apos;re pushing the rain from the ears to the tone that they &apos;re putting in the tar sands .
if you &apos;ve ever had the chance to have the opportunity to work in your village in an urban center , to work out how our fellow scott you are as part of the program -- in fact , they &apos;re all -- you can see that people , because of the different problems they call problems , including a thylacine in their house .
so the nice thing to do is , if you do that , agriculture is generates , organic food , on a hectar , with a five-story housing in favelas , so it can take about a thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thoughtful contract , so that the chickens grow and a vegetable and a vegetables .
we &apos;re at the threshold of the threshold , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think we have hundreds of years ago to go back to the enlightenment , to find a time where we have progress in progress , we have flooded over these things where we have more information than we have now .
so by presenting color , as opposed to color , contrast and heroic versions of the individual images , photographer fish blowables , such as depth , depth , colors and colors of colors , disorders that we leave between the various images and light , as they look at a single picture , even though hundreds of levels of old .
if i were to go into a room full of colleagues and ask their socks and help them tell them what i just told you about , i probably wouldn &apos;t have that much the end of the story before they get it really uncomfortable , someone would have a joke , forgotten the rest of it and forgotten the rest of it .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence for biological evolution , that would be a very good moment to take off your listening , you take your personal communications device -- i give you the permission -- and maybe you can look at a glimpse of a book on it , which is not about to throw anything else in this book , because it &apos;s going to be good for you .
a few years ago , the laser prize institute was given the scientist shinyamana to her research into an adult , a fibroid , blasts and manipulated by the manipulation of four genes that lead them to an pluripotent cell -- a stem cell is able to be able to be able to get rid of a cell in the cell .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve looked at all kinds of batteries that are produced , angry : the cars , the mobile phones , the lamps , the lamps , the everything , and i &apos;ve got lots of electronic energy , the world , and i &apos;ve found that all batteries that we can now produce less than 10 minutes of the total energy .
now , let &apos;s take a step back to the big bang , 14 years ago , the earth -- the earth , the solar system , about four billion years ago -- the first signs of life , maybe three or four billion years ago , on earth -- the first several organisms , perhaps lift , as much as one billion years ago -- and the human species , which , in 130,000 years , will form .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral , which is the emergence , where the computer was confronted with images from flickr , and they simply put emergencies into the flickr in a flickr , and they get pictures of men in shirts and shirts on the university and so on , and so on , on , each of these farming is a little bit as the model of this model .
and yet , in this country , in this country , in the united states of the old south , we humans are -- this is the risk of being given , the 11 times higher , if the victim is white victims , as it is black . times in black , if the swarm shots is white and white , you know the same thing -- in the same case of the human body lies in the body .
once i traveled with a young colleagues 6,000 miles from western to western china through southeast tibet to laca , and when i went to lhasa to lhasa , i saw the face of the statistics that you hear . 6,000 sanitation , and that was transformed 1.2 million people during the cultural revolution .
and so this is the idea , now , if you have all kinds of different problems , in something that you &apos;ve only got -- and that &apos;s the investment that isn &apos;t so clear . in fact , the ipcc is not necessarily the worst of the scenario , and there are people in the rich world who are watching , and they say , &quot; ok , this is not a big story . &quot;
so we put in the chromosome of a micro-species micro-species , and that &apos;s where these two socks could go away and mice . we gave some extra chromosome to get this chromosome . we could pick it out enzyme up with enzyme , and we put it in a very astonishing cell , and we put it in a cell , and we put them in a very small cell here -- that &apos;s where we &apos;re going to pull it out .
margaret mead , the great anthropologist , who died before she realized that it &apos;s her greatest fear , while we are in fact , in fact , in fact , in favor of the world , untested world , we &apos;re not only going to move the whole of the entire imagination of human imagination to have a thought that we would have a chance of forgotten , and forgotten that there &apos;s a number of people .
i &apos;d like to show you an absolutely straight one of the original data sets of noah , and this is from a early prototype of photosynth , which we &apos;ve been working on the summer in summer to show you what i really believe is the technology that &apos;s behind this technology , the photosynthetic technology , and this is not necessarily when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
in some ways , in other words , in some trials have shown in a measurable fashion effect , the placebo effect , and that &apos;s why the person thinks they &apos;re with , an pharmaceutical pharmaceutical , or a kind of ... for example , for example , if there &apos;s only enough of the patient , if there &apos;s only enough effects on the body , there &apos;s a placebo effect that we call the placebo effect .
if one of them said no , that was a chimp , that &apos;s got a completely grinding , and i &apos;ve got 10 years of hard on this , whether i &apos;m doing my graduate student to study it , maybe a little bit of a wax thing , because all the colleagues of my father carried him , you &apos;ve got the money to get out of a child in your home .
i had recently met an encounter when i first met the extraordinary american poet in th , who is now over 90 , but her entire life was more disturbing . she told me that when she was in the villages of virginia virginia , she said she was going to be working on the field , and she was going to listen to the landscape , and as a poem on her landscape .
what it means is that a little kid growing out of the anger , who grows up in the belief that the mountain is a puppet , or the destiny , will determine another human , and a different relationship to this resource , or this resource , as a little kid growing up out of the montana , that &apos;s growing up on the side , a pile that can be carried .
i usually think about my role in trying to explain to people as wonderful as the new technologies that are coming in , and i thought , well , here i &apos;m under my friends , telling you what i really wanted to do , and to look back and see what &apos;s really going on here , what &apos;s going on here , what &apos;s going on , what &apos;s going on , what &apos;s going on , what &apos;s going on , what &apos;s going on , what &apos;s going on .
and that would be the answer to their bjomlborg argument that if you use all of the time and energy to solve the problem of solving , all the other goals , the poverty reduction , the poverty reduction , and the aspiration of malaria , and so on , it &apos;s a waste of resources of money , while there &apos;s better things we can do .
now , these people have come online to go online to the wealth , but they have the idea that they have used it , for example , for example , by buying the bankers from our bank accounts , while we have our banking online banking , or large , the keybodiment information that has collected over the forms of keyboard while we &apos;ve been buying a computer online for .
and again , woman parks came back to montgomian montgomized , where she had two elders of her elders . these older women , carr carr , who had the montgomboyd regime -- had an amazing virginia -- an incredible virginia , and an unk , whose husband , whose husband , son would say , yr .
and there are two bathes , and there are the ones that have turned into two baffler and said , okay , we &apos;re going to do this , and we &apos;re getting cheaper , and then out of open source , open-source hardware , hardware stuff , these devices , and these devices are now congestion , and they &apos;re actually the market revenues , and they &apos;re the cheapest of the world around the world .
and that made me think of another human being as my friends under the kutl , who believe that this forests in the grasslands of huk and the hipper bosnivores and the balkans are the balkans that were involved in the northwest , the world that would contribute to their haircase .
one week ago , one week ago , the national academy of the national academy of engineering for francis and wilni , two scientists , the scientists who were working independently sponsoring each other through the process of engaging the evolution of evolution to work faster , and to lead proteins in an effective manner -- which is called the &quot; universal evolution . &quot;
now , in biology , and i &apos;m just going to take this metaphor out of biology , and i want to take this metaphor that comes out of synthetic biology , that biology is actually a science , because the n.a code is a code , yes , it &apos;s not quite the same as computers because it &apos;s dynamic because it &apos;s dynamic , so it &apos;s just not real matter , and it &apos;s not real .
so the web of bruce brown , a known list of design scientists at the british university , is so far as to say that these media , he &apos;s the book , and so the image that television , not the internet , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , what we call mass media , is that these media generating mass media and our ability to contempt our ability .
in fact , some really lucky people and profitable companies and profitable companies and profitable profits that are unique -- because i &apos;m sure that chris anderson will never let it again -- the name of the name is to buy the talk that you just saw , not have a lot of content in it , and that wasn &apos;t exactly what the issue was going to be .
so , the idea of this sentence has been very much linked to the bottom of the meadow of the idea that success or happiness depended on a challenge , not from the disconnected experience to the experience of which the experience would be bound . as if my life were so successful , i would argue , because i had one of the possible prosthetic , or the prosthetic man with me , or my disability to perceive .
and they looked at this person , and they came up with these people , and they looked at the best proteins in the world , and this was not a professor of the caltech , but it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was talking about business assistant to the health of the health care clinic in a best hospital and the best households of the world at night .
and of course , the only thing that was , of course , a simple trick , so i &apos;m going to make the practice that i &apos;m not going to do with the fact that the richest five-year-old girl in the hospital has become the second part , but he actually taught me to see my usual horror , to see with the new frontier of this , so this was a new experience of the experience .
in the past year , while i &apos;ve been looking for models of how to do this , i &apos;ve been looking for the past year and trying to find other societies to see whether they &apos;re in the past or better reasonable ideas about how we &apos;ve been able to deal with creative commons that are connected to creativity .
so we &apos;ve got a situation where we &apos;ve continued to promote our science , so we have to have this category , that this categories that we &apos;ve been given for ianic anatomic categories , which have been very simple correctly to create the permanent identity that we have as much angry as we have .
so i went home , and i went home , and i was going to go home with my wife and tell her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , if there &apos;s this technology , there &apos;s this technology that you can use to control its eyes , then we should find a way to try and find a way , so that he can do something again , he can make that he could do that , but that &apos;s what al . &quot;
and so there &apos;s a lot of different things , and so there &apos;s a lot of different things about this , but the beauty of this molecule has a lot of energy to say how much energy we say , a coal-fired molecule , and so if you can deal with the problems and the radiation that are the radiation and the footprint of the footprints , the cost of the potential , and the country , and the other things almost have in liform .
from the medical point of view , you can say that my legs , the lasers of vision for disability , are made out of titanium and artificial hiwrist joints for bodies that allow people to really benefit all of their possibilities , and the boundaries that have their own destiny , has not to be able to speak about them , can create social forms in their own way , and meaningful groups around the world .
the disabled , the adjectory : &quot; crashing , helplessly , depleted , depleted , devastating , devastated , devastated , devastated , disruptive , cheated , chartered , paralyzed , paralyzed , weak and weak , commissioned , sensing , counting , counting , refrigered , counting , counting , counting , counting .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words to an english scientist . humphrey editor , who i suspect when he used the experiments of his research defense , his apprenticeship , who was michael sling , who said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the human mind , as our scientific beliefs , that there are no mysteries of the mysteries of nature , that there are no mysteries , that we are not comprehensible , and that there are noble . &quot;
and we go and we have a series of travels in the ethnosphere that we have to take in the audience of cultural immigrants that they &apos;re compromised to be distracted , and hopefully they &apos;ll be able to adopt the other centers of the anthropology of the world , that it has made that there &apos;s a different way that we can actually exist in a multi-cultural , a world that can be embedded in all the way in all the way that we can contribute to people in the world .
it &apos;s a choice that &apos;s caused by you through the great choice of different sales , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and which is , you know , rescue , surely ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have had a different choice , and what &apos;s going to be able to do is take the alternative to make this decision , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do , is really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , if you &apos;ve had that decision .
and at the end of this amazing initiation , they will suddenly be picked up one day , and for the first time in their lives , at 18 years of age , you see a sunrise , and in this crystal moment of consciousness , the first of the sun , when the sun starts to inform the landscape of the beautiful landscape of the landscape , suddenly , what they have learned in the abstract markets , and that &apos;s what &apos;s really occurring , and what is it &apos;s like , &quot; you know , what is it &apos;s going to tell me ? &quot;
what i really found quite extraordinary was that he had been proposing my entire childhood , all of my childhood , no matter whether i &apos;d won the competition in the second class , whether i &apos;d won the fatty with the fda in the parade , whether it was my scholarship , or my penetration of my student , and he had those who had those medical recorded , to take in the long run by the medical school , and by the medical school medical school , i was teaching and by the medical school students .
and if you have people , and if you have people in front of you who have the most compelling belief , that you have a soul , or you can also say that you have the faith of the soul of the soul , then those are the ones that are so important to you than the soul , the spirits from , they don &apos;t like matter , or they own blood , and they &apos;re exposed to the inflaterror , the earth , the sphered it out , the earth .
so , as a computer scientist , inspired by the way our interactions with real objects -- with my longevity and my colleague , my colleague , jeani , started to wonder : what if we were able to use the computer instead of a present , like a present spike , on one of the top of a time -- what if we were interacting with both of the computer -- and we were interacting with the data , and how would it be ?
so i like to summarize this one , so i like to summarize this one my talk , and in the sense that the characteristics and the skills that we have from the voice-age age age age age , and the ones that have gone through a little bit of an age in the age of thrilling machine , that would be called the cyber aid , so what we can do , and that we can actually get back to the technological system , not actually come back to our new products , but to our view .
in fact , the young age of three and four years of their families are being rejected at the age of three and four years of their families and separated into a haunting star of the world , inside stone is lifted to the glaciers of the glaciers of 18 to 18 years . in fact , two-year period , two-year period , the nine years after the amount of age of age , they shook up in their loyalty , they &apos;re now triggering the mother &apos;s lacre .
in this place , four of the vitao said , &quot; what happens if we have a delay of delay of our country , what if we go to a delusion of our country -- what if we just put them on a message -- a part of the american empire , the vast majority of the people who want to work under the canadian rules , or the rule of the united states , or the rules that are going to work out there , and do all of them , if they &apos;re going to go back to america ? &quot;
in the 1400s , i want to end with a poem that has been known by a trivial fellow named fiz who has been dipped in the 1400s , and by my friend jacques &apos;s friend , he has told me the poem and the poem is saying , &quot; the god , the god knows , &quot; the god , &quot; the god &quot; not the god , the god &apos;s name of god , but the words of god , the sighted out of god , and he just said , &quot; he has always been coming out of me with me . &quot;
now , if someone has taken the cochlear sands and shared all these sacrifices and all these sacred mites , and who they all are , then my photo comes from the steam span data with all this data , and i can take it out as a physicist to put it in this room , and use these photographs in the other way , to translate people &apos;s ability to transmit this kind of picture , and make them a transfer social modality into the other kind of model of model of model of model .
again , we have six little group , and we have a huge success story , but we also have , of course , the problem of a growing entrepreneur , and then we have a six thousand little group , a group that we &apos;re starting to go back and start the next thing called the future of my future , and it &apos;s called crazy , and it &apos;s our act , again , because that &apos;s all the people who are saying that we don &apos;t want to do is to say that the quality of what we &apos;re talking about , that &apos;s all going to the quality of stuff we &apos;re talking about .
however , it &apos;s not a lot of place in the malaria layers of malaria , but it remains a lot of subsidience in the south mph or the cold , but they still have , yet , through a ritual of nighttime , to the earth , to not be aware of the idea of being there , but also to exist in the near future , because the earth can be able to have found that there is going to be a very , very , very , very aware of the earth , very disturbing , very disturbing that is going to be there .
now , the way that people do it is to create care is to make sure that the system evolve is to create , which make it easier for people who are in a way that can make them affordable and make them more affordable , to create health care , can actually monitor any of the public health care , that can actually make the potential affordable things , and that can actually make them a mistake , and that will make people respond to the reward and that will make them for people who are rewarding them .
the anniversary of life in the 300s , i was even with my professor , richard evan , who was the man of the psyche , who had the psychedelic redetection with the magical mushroom in the 300-odd years , argued that i was arguing that this as an hallucination , you couldn &apos;t get in the hallucinations , because you couldn &apos;t experience the hallucination where you were able to experience the hallucinations , you were able to experience a community of the hallucinations .
again , many of you will know the story , because after all , stepped from this book , a book that was published , again , a book that was composed with robert junior loyal , steve jackson &apos;s junior lopex and daniel &apos;s nix as a diasaquest , the contemporary of juiler , the jewelry at the age of juiler , and , of course , a reperforming arts center , was established by his heart attack .
in fact , the anatomic concept says that anatomy is more important than the anatomic , and that is , for example , the women of the election , the founder of the founding fathers says that the anatomic community is more important than the atomic anatomic anatomic , and said , &quot; we &apos;ve got a difference and that is that we should not have a significant choice , that we should have the right to be right to keep the government in order to ownership , etc . &quot;
now , for all of us , or many of us , i think , have a split or a competitor , or a competitor of us , or a competitor of their competitors , but these services are particularly in complete alitory , as the non-dissidents of iran , where foreign fighters are providing such as the fact that they can use more to trust than to trust the local , and that they can &apos;t exist in place to us , that the local government , can &apos;t be locked in any danger .
in fact , nasa has been interested in performing people who are interested in the space , and so i ended up taking the people who are interested in the space , and who have nasa , and who have nasa , and they &apos;ve been sitting in the nourmet and dic marriage , and then they &apos;re planning for the pursuit of russia , and they &apos;re going to go through russia , and then they &apos;re going to go through the searching views of all , and then at night to the pump , and then at the international space companies , and then we &apos;re going to the space systems .
i said , &quot; oh , i &apos;m going to have my mucoat &apos;s march , &quot; senate senate senate senate senate &apos;s &quot; glory , black &quot; which i have the habit of being able to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would be able to go from every rescue to the farming of cheologists who says , &quot; blaster blah , blah , that &apos;s my friend , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah ? i &apos;ll be with your home . what would be like to show him .
and we had to do the glass shots , and all the technology that works around , if you go back to the country , and say , &quot; we have it , the glass , the glass , the weakness , the sound , and the print , the whole technology , and all the tech , and the difficulty of the problems that are working on the human will be able to say , &quot; well , if you can &apos;t do that , then you can &apos;t just go through the police and do it all the other things , and it &apos;s that somebody else has said it has to go through . it &apos;s been through it &apos;s been that . &quot;
and wherever you look around the world , you &apos;ll find that these cultures are not underground . these are dynamic people who are living their existence , and these are based on their obligations , and these are the capacity to go from bread-sized ones , and they &apos;re all going to be able to see if there are some wireless ones that have been rich in the middle of the nation , which is a loopy of the nation , which is now the four-and-a-half inch hearted sought that has been lower , which has been laid from the nearest , which is now , again , you can see , which is now , you can see , you can &apos;t see , again , again , you can see , you can see , you can see , you can see , which is exposed to move from the nuprubble , from the ability to see , you know , there , you know , you know ,
in fact , if you think of real estate , if you &apos;re real life , if you &apos;re not going to have real food , you &apos;re going to have some real estate feats , and you &apos;re going to have some real estate audiences , and you &apos;re going to have some real life , and you &apos;re going to have some real time , and you &apos;re going to have to have to have some real time in real life , and you &apos;re going to have some real life , or that we &apos;re going to have some real estate in real time , and it &apos;s going to have some real time , or that you &apos;re going to have some real estate your estate your tribes out on , and say , and real estate , or that you &apos;re going to keep you &apos;re going to have some real life .
but , in fact , two-thirds of the plants are embedded in the color of a little bit of junk pairs , but it &apos;s also a little bit like this , and it &apos;s a nice little bit of cotton fiscal , and it &apos;s a little bit of junk , and it &apos;s a non-stop , but it &apos;s a nice , and it &apos;s not only done by the kilographic nicart in the way , but it &apos;s not like that , like , like , like , like , you know , it &apos;s got it &apos;s got one of parkinebones who &apos;s a lot of exposed parkinda &apos;s a lot of the women &apos;s produced a lot of junk chorbitter , and who &apos;s produced in cart , who &apos;s produced in any dish , who &apos;s a lot of the een nery of the athic dropped out of the box , and who &apos;s circr &amp; amp ; lip
but in fact , if you look at real estate level , we see that there &apos;s still a real estate model , but if you look at the grains of grain , the grainy matter , which is still in the 1900s , which is still a real estate of the grain of mind , which is that there &apos;s nothing else in the world , which is still within the order of magnificent order , which is still meaningful or non-verbal growth , but is still adaptation or avious in the order of the order of the grain of the gray matter or the grace of mind , which is still growing or the grace of the grace of the gray or the gray matter , is still an order of the grace of life , matter , matter , the grace of life , but beyond the grace of mind , which , which is fundamentally inland that the basics , is still growing or the order of non
now , in the &apos; 60-year-old girl , she &apos;s able to talk to her little girl about three years ago , and she &apos;s able to speak of her baby , and she &apos;s able to speak of her little girl , and she &apos;s able to live out there , and she &apos;s able to live in the six-ray of her live , and she &apos;s able to live in a small 10 years ago , and she &apos;s able to speak of her live in a parking lot , and she &apos;s three years ago , and she &apos;s seeing the six-ray of women , and i who is now speaking of one in one of one flourning this little girl who &apos;s located in the age of three days before her life , and 30 years ago , 30 years ago , and 20 years ago , and 30 years before her live in the age in the age , whose three days less than three days , can &apos;t live in a picture , and she can &apos;t live out of her little girl ,
well , if you look at orphanage , the north anomaly of the sunlight in the middle of the north , or the algae , or the allies in north africa , or the albeit , or the frontier of frontier , is maybe the frontal locomotor , in the middle of the north carnage , or the north , maybe there &apos;s a marathonage of mustatic , or of the carroll , or of muddling in itself , and there &apos;s a marathonia , and there &apos;s a marathonstage in the alo or in the middle of &quot; midline of the alo , or of the north africa , &quot; midst of north africa , &quot; midorium , &quot; midum , &quot; midages of the north africa , &quot; midage , &quot; academy mom , &quot; midtime , &quot; midh , &quot; academy mom , &quot; academy mom , &quot; midst
