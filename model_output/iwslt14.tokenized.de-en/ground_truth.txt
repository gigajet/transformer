thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you so much .
thank you very much .
it &apos;s true .
is that something ?
yes , well ...
no kidding .
it &apos;s possible .

pretty simple .
thank you .

thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
from seattle ...
i don &apos;t know .
which is singing .
it is possible though .
that doesn &apos;t happen .
yes , hello .
we love innovation .
solar technology is ...
this is not ...
we were poor .
is that all ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you guys .
after one week .
nice one .
that was us .
a few less .
and he says ...
we know that .
ta-da !
like twice over .
here it is .
it goes fast .
you need time .
music as language .
that &apos;s wrong .
this is hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... yet .
thank you .
what a fish .
nothing will happen .
that &apos;s efficient .
wonderful , right ?
totally inefficient .
that was all .
thanks so much .
explore .
that &apos;s your only chance .
there &apos;s no hospital that can say &quot; no . &quot;
thank you very much , guys .
this is stephen watt .
three times out of 10 .
which was awesome .
thank you . thank you .
yes , so to speak .
it &apos;s horrible .
a long time , yes .
fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
the sun is rising .
oh , my god .
we love entertainment .
we &apos;re taking off .
go home to where ?
what does it mean ?
what does this mean ?
oh , my god !
we &apos;re losing them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help you .
it &apos;s a lot .
does that sound good ?
the whole environmental discussion .
sound familiar ? right .
it &apos;s a crisis .
that &apos;s super important .
and this was fascinating .
can i be honest ?
the farm &apos;s incredible .
what did they do ?
robert gupta .
that &apos;s the system .
that is doable .
yes , hello .
lento , slow .
all that interests me .
we can do that .
what would you say ?
not very sustainable .
yes , milliseconds .
that &apos;s our present .
they have similar principles .
yes , hello .
good job ! yeah !
just do your job .
this was the result .
thank you very much .
and they did .
so meet al .
play &apos;s essential .
they all matter .
very different notion .
tremendously exciting .
i actually am .
ban is blank .
yes , that &apos;s possible .
fly away , cat .
this is the last one .
can we do this differently ?
and those days are gone .
these guys make money .
so what happens here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
score them again .
and that &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know .
centers were established .
so what happened here ?
but you know what ?
what was the result ?
i was amazed .
it is generic .
so they know everything .
you could see manhattan .
here is the video .
it has sensors .
why not live longer ?
he answers the door .
quite a few more .
that &apos;s very good .
oh , that guy .
there &apos;s no normal .
yeah , i know .
pretty good , right ?
but you know what ?
i &apos;ve got a question .
okay . thank you very much .
i was exposed to him .
gamers don &apos;t sit around .
so , you can do it .
they &apos;re feasting . &quot;
so let &apos;s have a look .
somehow this isn &apos;t working .
what will these people want ?
i don &apos;t believe that .
and i thought about that .
it &apos;s interesting to me .
they &apos;re using their hands .
so how does it happen ?
how engaged you are .
this would have been fine .
what is the media today ?
you can enter inside it .
so where do we go ?
so this is for real .
how do we know that ?
because , you know something ?
it &apos;s not a country .
why do we do that ?
doesn &apos;t happen very much .
bg : thank you .
so this is a wish .
and i was an artist .
let &apos;s call him don .
not guilt management .
and it must go back .
we can do it differently .
they actually hurt .
and i understand that .
tremendously challenging .
there is no feed .
it goes against justice .
but the wrong things .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
i am a writer .
here &apos;s another example .
i represent children .
it feels great .
i swear .
i &apos;m surprised .
it won &apos;t .
thanks for listening .
why do this ?
thank you .
let me give you an example .
the first two theorems are logically correct .
there &apos;s nothing poisonous in it .
but i carried on with my work .
they had to worry about being bombed .
so i &apos;m just going to enter in .
one of two things is going to happen .
and so , we need energy miracles .
why does this happen in the first place ?
huh . hang on a moment .
i &apos;d like to tell you why .
what do you want to do ? &quot;
this is happening to us today .
and i went back to work .
well she was back all right .
and so i did .
yes , there it is .
i &apos;m totally with you .
and why is it true ?
and it &apos;s pretty amazing .
this is really cool . &quot;
what needed to be done ?
what is the soul ?
you make comparisons .
it was different in china .
thankfully , right ?
but that &apos;s not protection .
give pee a chance .
does anyone see anything specific ?
and i always have been .
very expensive real estate .
people were going crazy .
what creates the illusion ?
my hunches again .
after only one trip .
the first : cut .
so i made one .
yeah . all right .
turn the camera off .
jk : both .
but it gets worse .
so here it is .
thank you very much .
be a mentor .
maybe 10 times more .
but it hadn &apos;t .
the data came back .
that is a fantastic question .
i never will forget it .
there are billions of them .
have you seen these guys ?
but there &apos;s another thing .
so here &apos;s another example .
or is it photography ?
he is my grandfather .
ohhhh .
and then it went international .
there were remixes .
so let me recap .
okay , a bit more .
and the answer is no .
keep going . have fun .
my name is amit .
he had had the experience .
it keeps you fresh .
that &apos;s a great question .
is that your opinion ?
an almost identical structure .
and it even got better .
she did it in secret .
he liked it very much .
here you see the city .
good afternoon , everybody .
will i like the color ?
aww , thank you .
some have come and gone .
i don &apos;t think so .
dk : 60,000 .
this is an old study .
don &apos;t be daunted .
we made this game in 2007 .
that does not hold for emotions .
his name is paul offit .
what do you think happened then ?
who &apos;s going to be sure ?
first , we &apos;ve got population .
i don &apos;t love that question .
but what are your fish eating ?
let &apos;s call him don too .
that &apos;s exemplary .
the work of the interpreter .
but where are we of use ?
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
how do we humans actually function ?
inventing his own narrative .
i will never forget it .
well , what does that mean ?
now , what does that mean ?
privacy is implied .
we have online criminals .
we have three main groups .
there were still fishes .
he kept pointing here .
and then it happened again .
and i felt really good .
and many people forget this .
crisis . death . disaster .
i couldn &apos;t bear it .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
it &apos;s not our problem .
we &apos;ve been disconnected .
why not think about it this way ?
we love technology . we love creativity .
it would be unconscionable .
we &apos;re constantly running into each other .
and it opens up a map .
but what are we doing with it ?
that &apos;s about all it can do .
what am i going to look at ?
this guy &apos;s name is tempt .
is it going to be my size ?
now , this sounds crazy , right ?
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
we need to get the message out .
most people here have heard of them .
that &apos;s something we have to understand .
you can see this at the bottom .
i want to ask a question .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was devastated .
they sort of go like this .
is it something about the light ?
and i grew up in india .
that &apos;s the two-cent tour .
you can see the water coming .
i &apos;ve lived a good life .
so what happened years afterward ?
who are these cousins ?
i wanted to keep us healthy .
these changes are coming .
how about fitness ?
this is really exciting .
but the point is ...
what happens is this .
and then presented .
what what happened there ?
the orange tractor .
they really loved it .
but i felt worse .
they called me .
superior technology .
very scary .
the soul is something mental , leibniz said .
that means that instead of having individual memories , we have standardised , widespread patterns of memories , onto which we can attach our personal memories .
what is decisive , if i &apos;m right , then it &apos;s valid .
he kept pacing back and forth .
other than writing a check , what could we do ?
this is a chart of what it looked like .
so , i &apos;m going to wrap up now .
perhaps instead , of what &apos;s really going on .
it might sound like it &apos;s a bad thing .
we were a group of twenty people .
and that means there are too many of us .
you wouldn &apos;t be able to have bones .
he &apos;s the dude on the left .
or , is it , perhaps , possible ?
conflict is the genesis of creation .
so , what do we have to do ?
they didn &apos;t have books , after all .
and this is felix , actually .
actually , i made two more mistakes .
thank you for your attention .
so that started the journey .
i was in awe .
and then everybody moved down .
you saw the big peak .
first overtime , second .
well , i was next .
now , who &apos;s normal ?
finally : epic meaning .
and here is a surprise .
same thing , only bigger .
who does the very best ?
want to feed the world ?
i wanted to support them .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
i &apos;ve loved only two .
one is south korea .
here you have it again .
it &apos;s a natural thing .
my wife told me it .
and how did you feel ?
because you can train that .
does that make you curious ?
so it &apos;s a circle .
so what why hacking ?
this happened around christmas .
and what is that thing ?
like that , you know .
you could have done better .
and the answer is yes .
why should i worry ?
and that &apos;s nothing .
you know , is it rational ?
so that &apos;s the good news .
and it was a huge success .
they were seeing something magical .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; absolutely , &quot; i said .
that can &apos;t be a problem .
they then also say , why ?
i highlighted it here .
it just hadn &apos;t been invented .
pattern recognition should also work .
does anybody know what this is ?
for example perception in this context .
this is a game for outside .
that &apos;s god , you know .
but it was very sad .
so let me remind you .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
and here &apos;s the thing .
i sometimes push too hard .
but they do the job .
it connected those two people .
her mother raised her alone .
okay , there &apos;s some .
think about your own choices .
this picture &apos;s from there .
i see this plus sign .
and it took 18 months .
tell me about this world .
that &apos;s very risky .
and that worked pretty well .
he showed it to javier .
and i memorized everything .
and there &apos;s hundreds of them .
now we talk about water wars .
and there &apos;s good news here .
it &apos;s not our burden .
and this made me really sad .
so what was the next step ?
it &apos;s not moving like that .
how could we help you ? &quot;
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
no had never been an option .
this is not a finished story .
so what happened on this day ?
all right , let &apos;s go .
they &apos;re all important choices . &quot;
it makes them feel good . &quot;
it really comes from these artists .
i probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
your plant can blow up .
that &apos;s cool , huh ?
she did it for three years .
so you can have this cloud .
this data was not available before .
play is not frivolous .
now how could this come about ?
is it just imaginary ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
okay , we can do that .
it is a completely different notion .
you have not changed the story .
everybody talks about happiness these days .
it doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
play is not just child &apos;s games .
and that was 19 yeas ago .
which one would you like the most ?
they are building an epic story .
you have that much uncertainty .
the data says it all the time .
no one &apos;s ever said that before .
so , paul &apos;s a terrorist .
and he actually says it that way .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what should our report card look like ?
this is a lot of volume .
and so that &apos;s a big challenge .
i almost never cook with it .
she was back and near death .
and of course that &apos;s incredibly slow .
and here you have the graphic again .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
an autistic pupil .
if at the moment they &apos;re waste .
so not like a detox .
and we absorb all of it .
we are dependent on two countries .
everybody needs a fishbowl .
let &apos;s make it kogi . &quot;
they were still kind of happy .
this was my first sunburn .
he was actually collecting fish .
my name is brian goldman .
she shares her experience with others .
so the white lines here are population .
and that &apos;s why i made the movie .
he pointed at the algae .
because technologically it &apos;s just not possible .
four and a half thousand people live there .
and you &apos;ll have a problem right away .
we can apply these things to other examples .
every bit of waste is a nutrient .
and so there are too many of us .
and so , the question becomes , how ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
but there are two problems with that .
i began to feel a bit better .
but , but , you know what ?
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i mean , that was epic .
i talk a lot about these issues .
today , there are 2.3 million .
and they don &apos;t tell us much .
it &apos;s this , just like this .
we went and looked at a site .
and so that &apos;s what we did .
and really you do the same thing .
now this is one of the images .
what other brands are like that ?
and then some very funny things happened .
you can play with a different type .
the whole building is made of water .
italy wins . yeah .
it &apos;s morning , before the match .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
that was -- the creativity had to find its outlet somehow .
nowadays , everything is very much up for grabs .
the other nurse asked matter-of-factly .
i &apos;m going to tell you something i probably shouldn &apos;t .
we maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cellphone .
and it starts with one physician at a time .
and i &apos;m going to admit something to you .
we &apos;re harnessing energy from the sun .
so this is all of the meta-data information .
logic does not make any statements about reality .
it will start to look more and more like you .
slowly but surely , it lifted .
somehow this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?
tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
it &apos;s about as far as we go out .
you know , what are the lessons learned ?
and the form has something to do with it .
and you wouldn &apos;t be able to save energy .
and then i can transfer the whole thing .
so that &apos;s reassuring , you know .
and one time we caught a live one .
the second mistake that i made was worse .
and she &apos;s hitting a 257 .
we all love baseball , don &apos;t we ?
and somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
that &apos;s about a 15-foot boat .
they &apos;re becoming like computers in open air .
because , did anyone have measles here ?
and then they execute on it .
it shouldn &apos;t take away from other things .
this is the one with the greatest impact .
the reasons for writing it .
at least not to navigate .
and that &apos;s just the beginning .
the truth is more like this .
do you want them distressed ?
talk about getting by with nothing .
and his answer was yes .
and the family gathered .
thanks for you patience .
we are a smaller brand .
what else is risky ?
just be who you are .
i remember my first fire .
what defines a story ?
dark urine . dark .
and i tried something interesting .
but totally effective , right ?
but we need this everywhere .
zero emissions , you see ?
it &apos;s entirely insignificant .
leave that up to us .
um , my brand ?
that &apos;s scary .
it sounds scary .
next would be nuclear .
another very exciting phenomenon .
i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then .
so i &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels .
and as soon as i walked inside , the judge saw me coming in .
it is impossible to present such things in a society that is supposed to function .
and i got in my car and i went to this courthouse .
i found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe .
will it be under $ 20 ?
and there are several reasons for this .
they sell certificates .
but it &apos;s not documented .
why did i go into medicine ?
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s spreading virally .
all the adults knew the risks .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i like things that are different .
i went to prison -- difficult .
didn &apos;t make sense to me .
that &apos;s easy , huh ?
isn &apos;t that awesome ?
and this video is real time .
the match begins -- silence .
otherwise you couldn &apos;t have teeth .
what about longevity ?
it &apos;s just better than reality .
so the correlation is low .
so , here &apos;s what happens .
and it really changed the dynamic .
so , i just started playing .
and then we said , okay ,
yes , here is the data .
something shoots through my head .
were you ever envious ?
it &apos;s like learning to speak .
because to me it means memory .
how and what did they feel ?
we say sustainability in germany .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
music is medicine . music changes us .
it turns out to be really difficult .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
these will be irresistible .
but what will come in the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and it &apos;s a very easy question .
this has nothing to do with science .
and that can make a big difference .
but there &apos;s another reason as well .
we certainly need one to succeed .
it is kind of a crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
so with that , i thank you .
they flooded the canals .
thinking , you know , two percent .
we started this over 15 years ago .
how far would you get with that ?
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
do you know what envy is ?
so the first step towards an interpretation .
and it still isn &apos;t an interpretation .
that must be our difference in age .
if you think about it , right ?
you can show that you were there .
that &apos;s just about the minimum .
we can win back our nutrients .
does anyone know what three seconds are ?
to the book and to the image .
that image reminded me of something .
i think it &apos;s odious .
sunlight and co2 is one method ...
but perhaps that &apos;s not the case .
and what does that mean to a designer ?
i would like to prove that to you .
was a very a very fancy project .
here , he &apos;s bringing the sun out .
this is hitting the reservoirs .
these flows are increasing very rapidly .
a has these benefits , and these risks .
our magazines are read by millions .
lego made it accessible .
privacy is not up for discussion .
they had been pushed genetically .
i am a redefined physician .
i don &apos;t take the same history .
baseball is filled with some amazing statistics .
because we live on a water planet .
do we really want to go there ?
you &apos;re an inspiring person .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
and those are the neural structures .
they haven &apos;t given up on government .
oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
something stiffened inside me .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
and so we measured its motion .
this is a photograph of the object .
and apparently it was quite popular .
you see some fun stuff happening here .
i like really nice clothes .
he only has use of his eyes .
but the reality is far from it .
you can go all the way through .
so , this crazy story might be true .
who could ever wish it on their own ?
defeat would have come too easily .
her father died soon after she was born .
for a year we were penniless .
we have to gradually increase the complexity .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
here &apos;s their jam aisle .
it &apos;s to supplement the experience .
but then you really want to go deep .
you want to navigate around the museum ?
that was more for emphasis .
okay , you really want to hear that ?
and i had to get out of town .
we &apos;ve won a bunch of awards .
who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
it causes leukemia in children .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
no . i &apos;m serious . i am .
i hold the knife in my hand .
and the object of this is quite simple .
i &apos;ll get my sleeve back .
architects and engineers , thankfully .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
and i see greg lemond now .
one billion people will go hungry today .
do they do that for the children ? &quot;
i fell out of love with this fish .
no , no , that &apos;s not possible .
and it will sound completely different from before .
he was over sixty at the time .
i founded an institute with this in mind .
they even can bring with them some financing .
the film hasn &apos;t even been distributed yet .
we &apos;ve gotta figure out which brands .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
i call this &quot; shiny tiger . &quot;
we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it &apos;s ideology , it &apos;s not science .
and it just disturbed me so much .
the world today has 6.8 billion people .
it &apos;s simple , that &apos;s what will happen .
he &apos;s wasting his time on nonsense .
today they &apos;re called project executing organizations .
he &apos;ll automatically go to the right thought .
that &apos;s how things of nature are imagined .
but it does require a lot of planning .
we can re-invent things all over again .
to what we &apos;re thinking from a northern perspective .
and that has to do with phosphorus .
they are usually forgotten by the third term .
for a longer time than these other two networks .
the bricks are color-coded .
because i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this is about shifting baseline .
and i began giving her my rap .
and that &apos;s a very sensible question .
i actually learned about this from my grandmother .
now we do the same with airplanes .
how do i get this removed ? &quot;
now we didn &apos;t write this app .
and every morning i hop on it .
amazing ! the machinery is kind of loud .
that &apos;s more than 250 hundred-thousand acres .
those are juxtaposed very nicely together .
what are the words that you would use to describe ban ?
if you don &apos;t know it already , this is coming .
there &apos;s world records that are on this as well .
to ask yourself , what is the right thing to do ?
with people , it is released in the urine .
i don &apos;t know who recognises what .
so , the living give birth to the spirits .
they gave her medications to raise her blood pressure .
thanks . i haven &apos;t come to the best part .
we have reached a kind of equipoise .
blissful productivity . i love it .
the result of that has been disastrous .
and everyone in this room has to get into it .
here &apos;s their olive oil aisle .
this is bjorn sundin .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
jeopardy &apos;s not an easy game .
in fact , we redefine what poverty means .
and i think that opportunity exists all around us .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
and we &apos;re actually doing some litigation .
i know this might be broadcast broadly .
and then my brother started staring at me .
over here , these are the apsaras .
now i &apos;ve been talking a lot about magic .
and who could have predicted any of this ?
oh , my god . oh , my god .
who are they actually supposed to be informing ?
it &apos;s completely directed .
what do you think happens next ?
there are . there always are .
so that &apos;s a tough one .
it &apos;s been constantly going up .
they literally flipped the switch .
&quot; best in the business . &quot;
so , please forgive me .
especially if he &apos;s already dead .
so two cycles are created .
the side product is clean water .
that might sound unusual at first .
we design unique elements into this .
you always lose rare animals .
it will get to you .
he died broken by history .
here &apos;s the building working .
they speared each other .
say what you feel .
the other one had a lot of diarrhea .
bruce brown , a famous design researcher at brighton university , went so far as to say that mass media and he means books and images , not tv , the internet etc. which is what we would define as mass media today that these mass media have turned our memories to stone and have eroded our ability to virtualise .
this this hint at the fact that the boy knew , deep within , that his connection is really with the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that out loud .
and moreover , you don &apos;t tell your teacher that you like to set fires and are happy when the fire flares up .
but there are no associations to look for where you can learn how to make a fire .
we &apos;re still extremely attached to storytelling as a method of information brokerage .
it &apos;s separating students from a , b , c , d and so on .
and now our deceptive consciousness immediately senses , i can do something with this .
here this logic is expressed in this deceptive discourse .
so , with energy , all i could come up with is this .
i &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds .
and nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
i had written these crazy things .
so humans can &apos;t be pigs .
it &apos;s just a little less destruction .
and curiosity can &apos;t be learned .
that &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
a dalmatian , exactly .
first you see from back to front .
from the modern to the computer society .
that is exactly what you are doing .
we need to go far , quickly .
it &apos;s about repowering america .
all of these are consuming questions .
these are cell phones of the future .
they &apos;re homelands of somebody .
we go through initiation rites .
now look at this curve .
it &apos;s part of our life .
i represent people on death row .
they stopped us from being inspired .
introduce some mutations perhaps .
so scott gets this call .
we worked well into each night .
so i followed my hunches .
he retreated into silence .
now we see the opposite effect .
everybody applauded politely .
i think this is really cool .
you brought your pictures , right ?
... meaning not so optimistic .
he turns off the engines .
let &apos;s starting with sensing .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
they had a concept of blue blood .
i felt like anyone could do that .
i never knew him in real life .
even cats were watching this video .
jimmy kimmel actually .
so let &apos;s think about the atoms .
how would you guys describe your brand ?
we talk about bold , fresh .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
i &apos;m a redundant person .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
that &apos;s a painting of a circle .
the roof also is covered with water .
so let &apos;s start with sunday .
and women successfully argued that .
we can support them in doing good .
have a look what she &apos;s doing .
the captain waved me over .
sexual reproduction enters the picture .
let me read you the entry .
so , this is world without oil .
this is true . i believe this .
we talk about it ambivalently .
it was really , really quite profound .
he shook his head , no .
that will take place next april .
we were given very accurate data .
over the hills and all that .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but with the right design , please .
we can support them in doing good .
and just to say , what is information ?
it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s vanished .
there &apos;s never been a time like this .
and even lomborg has changed .
if this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
also , these are intermittent sources .
how are you going to feed the world ?
this is an ecological network .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
the chef had overcooked it .
you put a box like this over there .
it &apos;s a solemn part .
that which i just presented to you .
what takes twenty-five milliseconds ?
then i see the dalmatian .
it might take a moment to load .
perhaps we should take another look at this .
no , no , that &apos;s way off .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
156 nations carry our television channel .
they will tap your internet connection .
but today , it goes beyond that .
it was not drowned yet .
i &apos;m human . i make mistakes .
that &apos;s the system that we have .
and i kept asking myself these questions .
and it was what i was feeling .
we are living into extraordinary decades ahead .
what will these three billion people bring ?
you should ask for some of that .
something really weird is going on here .
and that was the onset of als .
it &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
it can know how we &apos;re holding it .
so it &apos;s feeding back on itself .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
this is a modest little app .
the shores are from a different location .
&quot; you have not let it go . &quot;
i lived in parallel worlds .
someone made an old timey version .
and i &apos;d like you to read it .
there &apos;s one more part to the story .
you can be logical and intuitive .
tell me a little bit about that part .
make it possible , everyone in this room .
so tempt is now completely paralyzed .
does anyone even know what those things are ?
so that was the reason for the project .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
let me tell you a bit about it .
we don &apos;t have that kind of situation .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
so , we can give ourselves a gift .
that was the first upright primate .
and there are also tons of collaborators .
daniel kahneman : sure .
everybody would like to make people happier .
dosage has something to do with this .
and why ? genetically engineered food .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
we have measles in this country now .
not even the truth will set them free .
you &apos;ll remember the rule of three from school .
you see the timeline on the top .
in many cases , people are actually perfectly healthy .
and we &apos;re not exactly sure why that happens .
so , it &apos;s not just about the words .
thank you , danny kahneman .
above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
how &apos;s that look out there ? pretty good .
because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
we don &apos;t want companies owning seeds .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
they manage the process , they understand the process .
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
feasting ? i was totally confused .
and here can you see the whole thing again .
we truly are living in an extraordinary time .
that &apos;s how people imagine the soul works .
a particularly nice story , in my opinion .
his personal impressions of the waterlilies .
i &apos;ll try to do that using an example .
he will have to process that as the present .
but we &apos;re beginning to see a sea change .
this is an annual melting river .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
it &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
so littlebits is open-source .
it &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
they were maturing at five centimeters .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
so let &apos;s pull up , now , something else .
it &apos;s all coming out of our own pockets .
these devices aren &apos;t accessible to people . &quot;
as an artist , connection is very important to me .
and here you can see roberto dancing .
and anyway , italy won at the end .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
but play &apos;s a shapeshifter .
thank you . i &apos;ve got a question for you .
he had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
so , let me give you a little peek .
now , that &apos;s just an insurance policy .
well , again , it should have the two elements .
protect the environment , produce less rubbish .
but i &apos;ll come back to that in a moment .
yes . what this is really doing is discovering .
the goal of this whole film is transparency .
a language is a flash of the human spirit .
this was the sailfin grouper .
what they need is a redefined medical culture .
alone , ashamed and unsupported .
do you want to come over and listen ? &quot;
well i believe that our identity is at risk .
a lot of my clients are very young .
my cousins would be running around everywhere .
and we &apos;ve had some fantastic presentations .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
here are two different jewelry displays .
now who &apos;s ready to go on this trip .
i &apos;ve got it here on my laptop . &quot;
i &apos;m going to deal directly with the artist .
eating an entire bowl of cool whip .
and the difference then , they perceive as a loss .
in two hours it &apos;s biodegraded , wherever it is .
and the emerg. staff pulled out all the stops .
there &apos;s no insurance company that can say &quot; no . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot of great books that have been written about this .
and up until now , it &apos;s been a supercomputer problem .
this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved .
you can just tell beforehand . and why is that ?
what am i appealing to you to step forward and drive ?
and it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
can &apos;t we just cut it in half or a quarter ?
so , what can we synthesize out of all this ?
so you could call it the translation of a translation .
there is not one single tree that is carbon neutral .
and , what &apos;s more , you &apos;ll now always see it .
now the next step that happened is within these communities .
and he had posted lots of nature videos in fact .
that &apos;s just a working title , by the way .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
thank you guys very much . that was awesome .
so , it goes like this , from here , right .
in terms of fuel , this really solves the problem .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
this is one of them , part of one of them .
it just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
in other domains -- the world of communications .
this is my supermarket . not such a big one .
but western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive .
i do get tired , as we all do .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
if you burn coal , no .
say , there are no predictors .
can you play it in blue now ?
no , we define what &apos;s inside .
and there &apos;s one central point here .
everybody was having some cake earlier .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
so what are archaic models ?
and the list can go on forever .
so these were my prime motives .
repower america . find out more .
and the problem is not technology itself .
it &apos;s called batting average .
we asked around and nobody knew .
my mother phoned minutes later .
monday : color is powerful .
she kind of set us up .
and that generally looks like this .
remember those nappies again ?
so give me a hand here .
imagine mozart being efficient .
i &apos;m happy to be here .
the flows have increased .
they actually make us worse off .
i &apos;m the pet guy .
it &apos;s called the cloud .
or take lipstick .
instruments have developed .
this is about virtuality , about non-linearity , about storytelling .
but he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a viral video , bear .
the first theorem is , klaus claims there is no soul .
this is a rule of three , which describes a logic to us .
you can zoom around very simply .
now i put a bass line in .
which is great , because we need that .
otherwise , go bother somebody else today .
this is the machine below geneva .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
they laughed more than you guys are .
their problem is that they have too little .
third : escalation of expectations .
the official dogma of what ?
they simply listen and then begin to speak .
let me show you how they work .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
i call it the rising billion .
we think about energy scarcity .
and that &apos;s it . thank you .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
you move around , you have fun .
just spread it as wide as possible .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
that means something built in a city .
second half . end of normal time .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
so just imagine that for a moment .
raise your hands . let me see .
maybe we can see it as change .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
and let me begin with one example .
you know science isn &apos;t a company .
if you burn natural gas , no .
now , that blew my mind .
i was trying to preserve the body .
life hadn &apos;t changed for centuries .
but so many over the years were helped .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
my fourth technique : condition for complexity .
the third technique : categorization .
it easily could hold a thousand square kilometers .
two ways of going in -- very simple .
they need to tell me about my brand .
it &apos;s something we knew how to do .
but then reality &apos;s always unpredictable .
the summer was a lucky summer -- 2006 .
thursday : confidence is key .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
this is just not some blue sky thinking .
i wanted to restore health from disease .
now let &apos;s take that a step further .
what ? that really flipped me out .
we object to genetically engineered food .
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
we vanquished it . puff .
my parents are closing in on 80 .
and , finally , this storage problem .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing you own .
we talk about drowning in data .
you can jump right into a specific issue .
you can drill into a particular year .
that proves it , doesn &apos;t it ?
protect the environment , consume less energy .
it &apos;s the so-called osit model .
now you see the dalmatian .
the last two mentioned are also present today .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all those things .
this is something that has to get to zero .
but i didn &apos;t let that daunt me .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
and in that time you can react differently .
our objective was to simply say , okay ,
and yes , i &apos;ll move on a slide .
it &apos;s all compostable all of it .
everything that &apos;s inside can be utilized .
china can make up for that in one second .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
in any case , you imagine it happening inside .
the permanent ice is marked in red .
and if not , do your dance anyhow .
oh , so jesus , what a thought !
my mother asked us to feel her hand .
seriously -- doomed , doomed !
now this cartoon makes a lot of points .
here &apos;s this couple on the hamptons .
so this is what the supermarket is like .
and i thought i could blend in .
we still think it is pristine .
the three words are : do you remember ?
i can remember that like it was yesterday .
so there &apos;s an opportunity to change that .
well i went into the courtroom .
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
we &apos;re right at that point of transition .
now i work in the solar technology industry .
and let me show you a simple example .
but it has an unexpected twist .
so that made sense , that was a match .
and yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
so scott was speaking person-to-person .
and here every piece is very well planned .
then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
is it something about the details or the colors ?
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
no one has to green-light your idea .
engines , gearshift -- four choices .
i think i might have actually heard more hands .
this would be someone who &apos;s entirely intuitive .
eeeeee ! no , thank you .
and that &apos;s a multi-million dollar corporation .
so this is where we need digital safety systems .
so again , that was a real good match .
the internet and its services are a miracle .
intersex comes in a lot of different forms .
so get in the game . save the shoes .
this is about one percent of the total population .
we have been here for about 130,000 years .
what we want to do is make the future .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
there is a lot of happiness coaching .
let me give you good close look at this .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
disgraceful . disgraceful .
we got rid of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
my grandparents pushed that number to 70 .
you hope you don &apos;t need to do that .
we need to go for more research funding .
every footprint is disadvantageous there .
normally now , i would take the needle out .
someone who didn &apos;t have a childhood is out there .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand it .
let &apos;s pretend right here we have a machine .
so what do you think happened to these design students ?
that &apos;s a key element of making that report card .
they live in an environment of chemosynthesis .
you know , i was a real science geek .
i &apos;m going to go ahead and select government .
and every evening , they fly 150 miles back .
every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm .
what &apos;s the feed conversion ratio ? &quot;
of course this lends itself to a smart grid .
nobody on this planet has done that in this way .
picasso &apos;s answer , just wait and see .
we &apos;re constantly creating tensions and conflicts .
that the theme of ecology is a global theme .
now i &apos;ll put some percussion in .
they &apos;re all on their way back underground now .
we had to take them out , which we did .
this is a major mechanism of evolution right here .
initially , all we did was autograph it .
but here &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to be thinking .
so you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
what do you do with certificates ?
this is alfred gonzalez .
you can have a succession of changes .
and it &apos;s very important for research in medicine .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
what would you say to someone who believed that ?
and he whispered in my ear .
the rest of the time they &apos;re delocalized .
so , i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
so , we &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
this is not a question between privacy against security .
and the question is , why do people accept this ?
and i went back to my work on the wards .
it &apos;s all bound by oxygen and silicates .
and we keep setting our expectations higher and higher .
i start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
and at first i thought we were playing a game .
storytelling is becoming more and more multi-sensorial .
and try that again and do that for another generation .
now a lot of people have given up on government .
as of next week , it will soon be available .
it &apos;s got one knob , on / off .
well it was a friday , this is true .
thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics .
i mean , nobody &apos;s ever seen a particle .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
the first on here is the classic , apple .
it &apos;s like , who do i want to be ?
things like that that are more of that positive benefit .
none of them wanted anything to do with this movie .
what do you think the response is going to be ?
you can see on the left side a small boat .
so i think we have to be in the lead .
and so we have this terribly simplistic idea .
so two couples each conceiving one baby .
ladies and gentlemen , meet your cousins .
that is the sole test of survival and success .
the teachers didn &apos;t know a switch had been made .
it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination .
the best is yet to come -- so in a second .
in this way , every concert is a different concert .
so not saving , abstaining from , avoiding .
and everything is either the packaging or the contents .
i could be parking right in front of my building . &quot;
and this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
she &apos;s supportive when other people talk about their mistakes .
i made it and i set to work treating her .
do you know what they call a 400 baseball hitter ?
i want you to notice two things from this curve .
and i have to tell you , it was energizing .
my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids .
i &apos;ve been illustrating books since i was 16 .
that our input to the system of government is voting .
there had to be another piece of the jigsaw .
i &apos;m going to show you my other favorite feature .
let &apos;s take sneakers for example , right ?
it &apos;s not even been out into other foreign countries yet .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
i no longer want to postpone anything in life .
so i spoke at a conference a couple months after that .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- so run their finger along .
i want to show you something here for the first time .
and , but of course , actually , it did click .
it was summertime : i had shorts on .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
and they &apos;re not just going to die of measles .
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
they don &apos;t spend time jockeying for power .
it &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the web .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . got off the phone .
these theorems are absolutely logical and correct .
absolutely . absolutely , i do .
there are also technical cycles .
it &apos;s going to be a stretch to do it for nine .
a third theorem which will turn up in people who have a strong attachment to the idea of a soul .
in the beginning there was the tribal society , characterised by language .
come , dance with me . come , dance with me . &apos; &quot; thank you .
we are supposed to view it as something that must be present in our lives .
we don &apos;t inherit an identity ; we get to invent it .
it was busy , i was in a bit of a hurry .
and i &apos;m going to break it down for you for just a second .
everybody is now trying to recognise something in this pattern .
and this man came over to me and he hugged me .
and those that were like that started to split and divide .
but it is not , by any means , an optimal situation .
i &apos;m sorry , man . am i freaking you out ?
and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape .
smart grids are a hot topic at the moment everywhere .
and we want to make this material accessible to everyone .
i &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that i do .
we &apos;re trying to do something about the death penalty .
we &apos;re looking at some very interesting developments in our work .
i said , &quot; well , what are you talking about ? &quot;
and despite that , it retains a level of realism .
so now for the topic of today : financial savings .
actually no , that was not the flaw whatsoever .
and this is very important , what i &apos;m going to say .
and we &apos;ve got such a long way to go with this .
it was four and a half years ago in italy .
and i &apos;m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have .
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve grouped together .
instead , let &apos;s look to the ecological model .
save those . kill off the rest .
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
all right , what is brand gerry ?
i want to help you calm down .
both are viable ; both take off .
amanda is wearing our elegs set .
there wasn &apos;t any cantaloupe .
everyone take their vitamins this morning ?
so , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
we have twenty percent in germany .
these nappies are everywhere practically .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
the only thing they had was their mind .
so to him , they were just blocks .
i wear jeans almost all the time .
this is a dead turtle .
so i guess that &apos;s my brand .
i &apos;ve got something to show you .
how about living longer with good health ?
we don &apos;t companies patenting life .
and so that got me very excited .
they reversed the flow of water .
so we can &apos;t bear these things .
in those countries where people have money .
and how does it look in there ?
we &apos;ve understood that weather is global .
and in this mind they had memory .
you probably saw it on the news .
this is a completely unsustainable pattern .
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away .
so we must get the phosphorus back .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
there seems to be a discrepancy .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
we made it over the last 11,000 years .
think about that , it &apos;s an incredible fact .
so now they understand the value of prototyping .
that would power the u.s. for hundreds of years .
well , i think number one is curiosity .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
those were the first calculations six years ago .
but perhaps someone just needs to change your mind .
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
of course not everything should be compostable .
when you fall in love with someone , efficient ?
and we can see that it can be done .
because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money .
yes , so , what is biohacking ?
so here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
the fact is , coal isn &apos;t dirty .
there are some that are much more spatial .
the company headquarters are right here .
one i thought had a kidney stone .
and to report back to my attending .
and we &apos;ve seen this in cellphones .
we &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .
and there is this stunning silence .
writing down the dna was an interesting step .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
but what happens with citizens connect is different .
i didn &apos;t know the protocols .
no apple has ever tasted the same .
goodnight sweet opossum . &quot;
now he &apos;s brought a tractor into the scene .
and they can also sense their motion and tilt .
if your job is to dance , do your dance .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
these are pictures over about a six-second period .
but settling isn &apos;t always such a bad thing .
we would never do that in our own countries .
they become rarer because we fish them .
so you don &apos;t lose abundant animals .
given all of that , mistakes are inevitable .
we have the tools with this exponential technology .
and i remember this just like it happened yesterday .
and actually i become a character in the book .
say , &quot; please repeat that process . &quot;
and so every drop was a little bit different .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and i put my challenge on 95 kg .
so i think the basics are quite simple .
i told my mother i couldn &apos;t do it .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
we found it was moving in really weird ways .
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project .
the responses mostly will be &quot; no . &quot;
you know how many people watch these ted talks ?
because otherwise , our problems would even be bigger .
so that &apos;s kind of our battle cry .
so you can reconstruct a whole movement .
here are the results we just obtained .
but in practice , how do you do it ?
and it &apos;s not just in terms of sex .
i want to achieve it through not dying . &quot;
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s tired .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
this is not about how happily a person lives .
and you can ask : what happens to these moments ?
... these dosages have something to do with it .
probably many of you in the room know this trick .
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix it .
and i have all sorts of little props here .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
now , i understand it . i do understand it .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
that really is very important , that we get there .
so let &apos;s think : how should we measure ourselves ?
i &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
we don &apos;t make money at these damn shows .
i can rearrange the sequence while it plays .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
and for nathaniel , music is sanity .
that &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
because this person is not interested in evidence at all .
because we can &apos;t live our lives without this lie .
he &apos;s only deceiving you and not himself .
why do i have to get such a small car ?
to form a phrase with one &apos;s own breath .
beginners &apos; classes hardly talk about interpretation .
because the notes are the only direct connection to him .
and , being young , i said , expectation .
it &apos;s about making a beneficial poop print .
the whole thing is a game , i must add .
and they didn &apos;t have photolithography .
and so it all brings us to one big question ...
you are virtualising the reality without a computer .
yes , what sort of projects do we actually work on ?
and the world we used to live in looked like this .
and we can just navigate in this very simple way .
if you generalize this , something like this happens .
and that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagnosis to make .
i was an obsessive compulsive student .
good , really good , maybe an all-star .
wealth , not culpability , shapes outcomes .
she was the end of every argument in our family .
that transition is happening . we can all sense it .
and we say that word with such contempt .
and in this case , a neighbor saw it .
so that worked . so booya for scott .
i made the decision to move to the u.s .
we do not want to try to predict the future .
in 2010 , it was viewed 23 million times .
and that &apos;s been my humbling experience in this .
and ultimately , we have to embrace transparency .
that &apos;s only online -- no print , no tv .
or are you more of a down attribute ?
what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about ?
so how specifically will we see ban in the film ?
you see , i had this idea for a movie .
i want to tell you how we found that out .
and this is the plot behind stuxnet .
i learned that it all changes in an instant .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
they don &apos;t talk about god and god &apos;s nature .
how could it be possible that we would do this ?
see , dr. kean made that shift in thinking .
it is natanz , and it is only natanz .
we have the passion of the diy innovator .
this is moore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
thank you so much for coming to ted . thank you .
we &apos;re trying to end mass incarceration . &quot;
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
now we do the same with drills and machines .
this is the call center for the services and information line .
and we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
we &apos;ve all got navigation controls in our car .
but at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
you guys knew there was a trick , didn &apos;t you .
all right , let me show you some more about this .
here is where we were , and this is the painting .
emc presents : &quot; embrace transparency . &quot;
there was a whole lot of crazy going on in there .
let &apos;s make a short provisional appraisal .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s a lot better .
we see the same thing with the disability rights movement .
but will we make the most of our playfulness ?
we had 8,000 people play that game for eight weeks .
it will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers .
they expect one billion more gamers in the next decade .
but one of them is distinctly worse than the other .
but you know what you &apos;re not entitled to ?
i thought , let &apos;s up the ante , once .
creates a bond , creates a bond of respect .
and so , i actually made a kind of curious decision .
so , you know , merging the two passions .
you &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
i don &apos;t know if any of you know this image .
now , i also agree that that is rational , for now .
and for me , it becomes necessary to integrate the two .
it &apos;s interesting , this question of the death penalty .
the child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities .
so it &apos;s got cute little game dynamics on it .
al is a fire hydrant in the city of boston .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
the underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
when i say realism , i mean photo-realism .
now we &apos;re a long way away from that goal right now .
and how has that been for them ? has it been successful ?
... a little more about you that is not who you are .
it was , &quot; in perpetuity . forever . &quot;
tuesday : fitting in is way overrated .
the dog ! i was stunned with jealousy .
would you like to be more attractive and self-confident ?
and she was barely breathing and she was blue .
people in the satellite room are starting to move in now .
but you can &apos;t count my fingers right now can you ?
they need it , and we &apos;re not giving it to them .
and some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
i &apos;m not part of that crowd , i have to say .
but phosphorus will not be able to be replaced .
the first question is , are there really too many of us ?
and we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners .
i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me .
and do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
it &apos;s creating hyperlinks , if you will , between images .
and therefore they &apos;re not perceived as a big loss .
i &apos;m going to speak about a tiny , little idea .
that &apos;s the kind of shame that is a teacher .
thankfully many studies are being carried out on this topic .
it &apos;s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game .
probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
and i &apos;d say , &quot; yes , ma &apos;am , i do . &quot;
and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world .
and then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
now , this is exactly , i think , how we &apos;re using games today .
in each of these five paths , we need at least a hundred people .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a high-maintenance resident .
and i &apos;d go over there and i would , i would just listen .
it reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well .
i &apos;m going to show you one example of what i &apos;m talking about .
so another one of my favorites , &quot; the starry night . &quot;
these results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor .
this is a gamer on the verge of an epic win .
why am i doing this ? what do i get out of it ? &quot;
there is a program that some of you might have heard of .
it &apos;s very gratifying to have this kind of reception here .
and he was here , as you well know , in &apos; 35 .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the options of it .
my mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat .
these are the people who shape the way i look at the world .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the flight attendant anymore .
so we &apos;re seeing this in all sorts of places in human life .
and that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three-month period .
it &apos;s law , it &apos;s morality , it &apos;s patent stuff .
the main problem we have here , it &apos;s kind of like aids .
i can say , the german chancellor is a man .
i have a nice , concrete example to illustrate this .
then i would say , my warm condolences , you see ?
and we get to re-invent ourselves as often as we like .
we &apos;re all born . we all bring our children into the world .
and his whole work process changed after that .
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
they &apos;re obscure , weird programs .
politics is not changing ; government is changing .
but what this image represents was the problem .
we &apos;ve got some places we can go .
we called it digital water pavilion .
because they have special skills of facilitation .
so here we have some natural fireflies .
the second factor is the services we use .
and it completely changed how i do movies .
it &apos;s hard to overstate the destruction .
so you could feel good about selling it .
that it comes to the human from outside .
so ants weigh more than we do .
we can take a look at that now .
go bother leonard cohen . &quot;
so go ahead and start inventing .
now it turns out you &apos;re right .
this is an idea worth spreading .
imagine then just two other little changes .
how many would opt for memory ?
and that &apos;s kind of the message .
so please listen when music is played .
so don &apos;t worry about climate change .
i can claim anything .
i can claim anything .
but we know that if we were to say that out loud , social relationships will be sensitively disturbed .
that &apos;s not supposed to be a joke , but here in the image below you can see there &apos;s the laboratory , in quotation marks , so a closed up garage with all this laboratory equipment that the university got rid of , a group in paris that set something set up something and is very successful with it and does some really interesting things there . i &apos;d like to briefly mention a project .
you do this and then you &apos;ll see the sentence , although i &apos;m with the fire brigade , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnical things .
at present at we have a very modern example , which is repeatedly an item in the daily newspapers .
and we &apos;ve accepted linearity as the law and there are only exceptions , such as non-linearity .
they were moving towards a naturalistic concept .
and these women would get together and just talk .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them .
and we built an ipad application .
grants and sponsors were sought .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
here , let me give you an analogy .
you zoom in . you really go in .
you look around at all these museums here .
how much money does it take to do this ?
think about this : this attack is generic .
and if not , stuxnet does nothing .
so we start with a windows dropper .
he says , &quot; brace for impact . &quot;
now imagine being in a plane with no sound .
it &apos;s a complete denial of mistakes .
the first is that we will not evolve .
this is another look at the tree of life .
they divided the entire kingdom in half .
and this is a classic gaming emotion .
there &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
we didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
and this took me awhile to figure out .
we did the exercise again with the same students .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
&quot; look at their bellies , pink .
there &apos;s no problem with overpopulation among trees .
you will notice that a change has taken place .
and the third area speaks for itself really .
i look forward to talking with all of you .
every large image is the beginning of a section .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
or are you more of a down attribute ?
the next one : this was the best day ever .
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to face .
it actually is much more dangerous and aggressive .
we don &apos;t want iran to get the bomb .
i &apos;m saying , &quot; please blow up . &quot;
you can move inside , have different types of experiences .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
play is the glue that binds us together .
if you have something to give , give it now .
how would you like to be better than you are ?
you &apos;re teaching them to open doors for themselves .
antonyms , healthy , strong , capable . &quot;
here are two patients , those are their recordings .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
i believe that for every person on the planet .
the ones who make scientific arguments are very few .
so , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
i &apos;m just showing the new york times website here .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
so it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
clean coal -- you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
but the volumes are much larger than ever .
it expands in winter and contracts in summer .
not just bad , but the worst book ever written .
everyone knew your genius was kind of lame .
we reconditioned them all , fixed them .
and the world we now live in looks like this .
but those are all the roads in the u.s .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10 .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s there , and comes back again .
cassava &apos;s something that half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
we leap into the arms of big placebo .
in the nuclear space , there are other innovators .
where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
also , the price of energy is very important to them .
we went back to the titanic wreck .
because artists have a distorted relationship to the lie .
and anyway , you work a lot less than i do .
or b , because you didn &apos;t learn how to sing ?
i will never again play as i did in this moment .
it &apos;s a type of territorial behavior , right ?
and then it &apos;s less usable or user friendly .
how can i make something as user friendly as possible ?
i don &apos;t see any reason why it shouldn &apos;t .
and how do we function , when we look in there ?
each society is characterised by one primary medium .
and these interactive portraits are aware of each other .
we &apos;re focusing on now fourth-generation fuels .
you may have read that we put watermarks in .
and it &apos;s also deeply embedded in our lives .
you have a model that emerges of the entire earth .
this old man &apos;s grandfather refused to go .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
so in other words , i define what i wanted .
and i see the same process with combining photographs .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
it &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
they had 348 different kinds of jam .
and i think there &apos;s almost a paradox with those .
so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
we transform the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
and he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot;
it came out of the university of washington in seattle .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
at one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
so that &apos;s occupythesec movement has done .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
it &apos;s been viewed nearly 50 million times this year .
but what about this day , this one particular friday ?
i want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions .
the faces in the audience were very serious and attentive .
i love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
we &apos;ve got to put that bear in a cage .
are you mindful , sophisticated like 007 ?
the experiencing self has no voice in this choice .
they &apos;re in the united states and europe and in japan .
and it made all the sense in the world to me .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
zidane , the headbutt in a moment .
you can almost always look phenomenal for under $ 50 .
so sex can come in lots of different varieties .
she is a girl . she is raised as a girl .
and no , this isn &apos;t burning man or san francisco .
wouldn &apos;t we want to open doors for them instead ?
here &apos;s the updated version of this entry .
it was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme solution .
and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings .
and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
they never give you a challenge that you can &apos;t achieve .
i mean i &apos;ve rarely seen lines so flat .
i take this hand away . you give the knife out .
and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
now you don &apos;t find several thousand targets in that area .
we are talking about -- around about 15,000 lines of code .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them ?
well , we presented this to mayor bel<<unk>> .
well today , we know everything about where our objects come from .
france scores . italy scores .
how do you judge people based on the content of character ?
now , chimpanzees are well-known for their aggression .
he robbed every ounce of hope from my being .
does it apply to others , or does it apply to us ?
so , i say : let the world-changing games begin .
there &apos;s an economist named edward castronova .
right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
the biggest difference between them is in the handling of time .
we &apos;re trying to get to the point of automation .
bg : an energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t put limitations on yourself .
with pivot , you can drill into a decade .
but for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too radical .
so , i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
and i understood that this was the very essence of art .
in reality the notes are very vague and imprecise .
because we don &apos;t we no longer make things free of stuff .
here here it &apos;s more likely to turn into my glasses .
like i said , it all just started in two thousand eight .
now , this is an interactive cartoon application .
and &quot; ole ! &quot; to you , nonetheless .
i &apos;m going to keep writing anyway because that &apos;s my job .
and everyone knew that this is how it functioned , right ?
i would prefer to keep doing this work that i love .
and the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
and i think that &apos;s the orientation that we have to change .
so it says , &quot; place your fingers upon each light . &quot;
the next step we took was to find the applications for it .
the other thing is we know where all the gas stations are .
so , simple : you come to googleartproject.com .
what are some other metamorphoses that you &apos;ve had ?
so we don &apos;t have the budgets that other brands have .
you do not have to spend a lot of money to look great .
we don &apos;t get that kind of constant feedback in real life .
i &apos;ll do it for you , and then i &apos;ll explain it .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing .
he said , &quot; fish ? i didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
a research semester on the topic natural user interface design .
i &apos;ll be revealing what &apos;s inside of it in a moment .
you know , nothing is possible in this fishbowl . &quot;
so we &apos;ll offer one of these fabulous scents .
in the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
and what we caught , we didn &apos;t have words for it .
now the fish is on the iucn red list .
30 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous .
but i think that there really is something coming along after us .
and that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
these communities of cells , again , began to abstract information .
and that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to be talking about .
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the opossums .
&quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was shown to be wrong .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the cutlery .
it is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together .
there &apos;s designers and builders of cities who are very interested .
it &apos;s not even online . it &apos;s not even streaming .
that &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remembering self .
so , our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace .
this is &quot; the starry night , &quot; i think , never seen like this before .
and you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , i learned a lot .
and i was , as a kid , constantly drawing comic books , and so on .
and , you know , if we think about it this way it starts to change everything .
and that , to a large extent , is what we want to do now .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things the same way each time .
and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did .
for 2050 , you &apos;ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction .
and so , i really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , then he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
you &apos;ll need some logic here , but also the willingness to lie .
i won &apos;t be able to play like i do today in twenty years .
but each time , they were gnawing at me , eating at me .
so lots of levels of testosterone , but no reaction to it .
the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my fist like this .
thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure i &apos;ve seen .
is it a manhattan project ? what &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
that &apos;s why we need to think from cradle to cradle .
those are spaces that are able to react to a human intelligently .
so how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
and the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle .
i sell pet toys all over the country , all over the world .
that &apos;s my flesh , and i can twist that around .
and that &apos;s the truth . now , the studio didn &apos;t know that .
no , throwing away is exactly the right thing to do , right ?
so many of them are occluded by faces , and so on .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
in both cases , they had their operations and they did okay .
she had irreversible brain damage .
the ethnosphere is humanity &apos;s great legacy .
and the fish also were happy to be there .
it &apos;s about the nuance of human language .
it was this misguided war on drugs .
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
it &apos;s more than that ; it &apos;s deeper .
but we know very little about where things go .
ok , think of this as extreme self-motivation .
i know what people think when they see this .
ask questions , demand proof , demand evidence .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
everything that &apos;s nice in life is not efficient .
just like it used to happen in the village .
what happened is the the so-called machine age .
however there is a political battle in our country .
they put her on a ventilator .
and yet , there is this disconnect .
it could happen in learning time scales .
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
i &apos;m here to share my photography .
i worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
you know , you can choose your list .
he smiled and said , oh ?
that means the rate of crime goes down .
so how do humans deal with certain objects .
and of course how design affects perception .
the disaster is for that two billion .
it &apos;s nothing if not ambitious .
i &apos;m a lawyer brand .
we no longer produce .
so if you think of the google glasses for example , then that &apos;s one of those concepts that allows us to combine the virtual world with the real world again , and so that means our affinity for virtualisation , of experiencing the virtual as something normal and natural , is being addressed again .
but actually that night , it was even more fun .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
it was called the automatic binding brick .
well diginotar is a c.a .
well because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
what will they consume ? what will they desire ?
he took a famous photo . what was it called ?
it doesn &apos;t slow for any of our grand challenges .
we &apos;re seeing this process feeding back on itself .
opossum ? check . living ? yep .
it &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
but combined , they can create something like this .
it &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
click and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum .
the idea is to circumvent a digital safety system .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explained it .
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
that &apos;s fantastic . i love big placebo .
really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy .
not a movie , not hd -- for real .
i was there not long ago with miguel .
that &apos;s a funny occurrence , you know .
have you ever seen a climate neutral tree ?
the same thing that i just described is now happening .
if you want to go far , go together . &quot;
repower america . it &apos;s time to get real .
frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
so i can step back , and expand on that .
i filmed in war zones -- difficult and dangerous .
so we better find out what the target is soon . &quot;
we can actually do the same thing with much less energy .
if we fix cities , actually it &apos;s a big deal .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
in other words , play is our adaptive wildcard .
can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco ?
there are other pleasures , but this is dominant .
they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
you can just say a few names and people will understand .
diphtheria , rubella , polio ...
this is a variant on something that has been done .
now , the price of energy has come down over time .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
we &apos;ll be using it in the opening of the film .
it caused immense celebration in the control room .
that &apos;s not a business , and it isn &apos;t agriculture .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sponge .
it &apos;s that acrid , tar-like flavor .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
and that is an escape from his tormented state .
and then we tried out a whole load of simulations .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the eighties .
the music instrument is an extension of our own body .
he only lived until the age of thirty-nine .
hey , puma , do you are you really serious ?
one a baby needs about six-thousand nappies .
i know of some people who haven &apos;t registered .
there &apos;s already a rather impressive number of people worldwide .
in 25 years it &apos;s gone from this , to this .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to swallow the sun .
so stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
there &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
you end up in thabo mbeki south africa .
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
&quot; well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
bruno giussani : thank you . thanks .
i have a friend who drives a passerati .
it is not only a nice wallpaper made of noise .
and as we get older , the nappies get bigger .
it &apos;s the time it takes to fall in love with someone .
and today we are still very , very dependent on stories .
and i think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies .
and the predictions , as you &apos;ve read , are serious .
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
it is also my great lifelong love and fascination .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
why do they market to us if we can &apos;t buy them ?
you &apos;ve got to admit that &apos;s a lot of choice .
and it &apos;s doing that based on the content inside the images .
a few years ago i started developing littlebits .
the brochures still say it is untouched .
my grandfather was in prison during prohibition .
she was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
so in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
it always starts with a sketch , an idea .
as you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
but what if you want to see brush strokes ?
but it didn &apos;t sit well with my logical side either .
i want to say just a word about salad dressing .
blaise , that is truly incredible . congratulations .
we &apos;ve also been taking littlebits to design schools .
this is a simulation of chesapeake bay .
i said , &quot; well we &apos;re trying to challenge injustice .
my male uncles died of alcohol-related diseases .
and my grandmother was tough , but she was also loving .
and in fact , we &apos;re such a multi-cellular community .
what &apos;s that new state that the world is heading toward ?
we call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
when one neighbor helps another , we strengthen our communities .
ohhhhh , wowwww !
they &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shelf space .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps .
well , i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
this is the real cool part . it &apos;s called collections .
open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
you see , we hear a lot about transparency these days .
and actually we show the whole process of how does it work .
you could also use conventional worm technology for spreading .
a friend of mine did that -- richard bollingbroke .
that &apos;s , imagine those pixels could actually start flying .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
and i can tell you that this is a transformative experience .
we have to start making the real world more like a game .
and he &apos;s an economist . so , he &apos;s rational .
i mean , how much do we consume our memories ?
the more money you earn , the more satisfied you are .
that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone .
about 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break .
yeah , bryan , the judge has some magic power .
and yes , i &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see .
secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
and for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
and i was like , &quot; hold on . that sounds interesting . &quot;
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come of this .
i did . the very first picture is a picture of my family .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing take place in this movie .
so the movie will be called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
only i think that he &apos;s rather loving it here , right ?
now i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m no hero .
and the doc says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . thank you very much .
turns out though , that that &apos;s not even where it stops .
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why are we fighting it ?
that &apos;s a lot of death of measles -- 20 an hour .
so there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
because they &apos;re the ones that are experts in flavor , too .
the system is so healthy , it purifies the water .
i mentioned that to miguel , and he nodded .
so the pinker the belly , the better the system . &quot;
and then it comes to me straight away , it &apos;s unfair .
and also anything they would conjure up in their minds today .
and oil will be able to be replaced by other energy sources .
i &apos;m not good enough , and i can &apos;t do it . &quot;
like seaweed , and other things that are scary .
i &apos;m not telling you about it because i want to use it .
it was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed .
so , i was completely smitten by this , and had to do more .
and , right away , i see there &apos;s a different pattern that emerges .
yes , that &apos;s what a what you see at the bottom is the load .
so that &apos;s why we &apos;re not talking about resource efficiency , but effectivity .
in holland we &apos;ve been working on this for over three years now .
and if i can , i &apos;ll find some of the sort of weird ones .
what we caught , i know now , is the bottom of the sea .
and that was my first time to be acquainted with that .
and i saw mrs. drucker , and she was breathless .
and all the while , i was amassing more and more knowledge .
so we talk about a 300 , a batter who bats 300 .
in 2010 , we had just short of two billion people online , connected .
well i &apos;ve been trying to say something about our criminal justice system .
and they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book .
&quot; because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
we have the capital of the techno-philanthropist .
and so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively .
since that time , we &apos;ve had all kinds of acknowledgment .
so there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience .
well , their experiencing self is not going to get happier .
and the answer is really straightforward : they are lost forever .
it &apos;s a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
i &apos;ve got a picture here of a place in kentucky .
it &apos;s got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to one .
and if i &apos;m right , then the chancellor is a man .
before this , we were in the so-called age of feudalism .
that &apos;s equal to 20 feet of sea level , as is greenland .
so , this is the publication we had just a short while ago .
somewhere in here there are actually a series of photographs -- here we go .
except they can if they hack into a foreign c.a .
and then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
and all of a sudden , he would no longer appear to be merely human .
and that &apos;s this piece of metal i &apos;m going to be talking about in a minute .
or maybe you &apos;d like to be more fit , stronger , with more stamina .
and i don &apos;t mean just good as in successful , although that &apos;s part of it .
my great-grandparents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
now , how we &apos;re going to go forward on this -- what &apos;s the right approach ?
+ that is they &apos;re all in the pre-nappy stage , so to speak .
and of course , we can never have the death penalty in germany . &quot;
we can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
and the more candidly i spoke , the more i was asked to speak .
and i &apos;m bawling , i &apos;m crying , like a little kid .
so obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase .
if you are happy , you are going to attract other happy people to you .
gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric .
how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real-world work ?
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
the fact is it &apos;s that uncertain part that should move us towards this .
and this is how people thought about creativity in the west for a really long time .
b has these benefits , and these risks . what do you want to do ? &quot;
one consequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke .
and how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality .
a couple months went by , and i had just forgotten all about it .
i think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a killer .
so for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
and so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years .
and this video had actually been posted all the way back in january .
each task was made up of many , many , many sub-choices of course .
there &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but i don &apos;t have time .
i &apos;m here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies .
they have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences .
there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . thanks .
you know , there weren &apos;t tangerines in the garden of eden .
yes , i &apos;m very happy to be here .
a all the beautiful things in life are inefficient .
we can see that phosphorus is really critical .
the next phenomenon that is also very interesting is sight .
i &apos;m sorry i have to keep this so short .
second , what economists call &quot; opportunity costs . &quot;
and i think it makes the world look like this .
but wait , this is actually my favorite project .
so nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
we just passed the seven billion mark on earth .
so let &apos;s project this analogy going forward .
so , if you could bring up the lights .
it was a store called draeger &apos;s .
are you ready ? you look a little nervous .
and as i move around my finger shifts .
things that are only used go into technical systems .
so the device you see here didn &apos;t work .
but that &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
they did it by draining the land .
well there are opportunities all around us .
embrace fear . embrace risk .
these things are logically correct .
that &apos;s where he signed up .
you can throw it anywhere you want .
a kind of astonishing error rate -- one out of nine people innocent .
the first example works with the presumption of something many of you know and some of you value , and only very few of you don &apos;t need at all .
it &apos;s a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling .
that &apos;s somebody who hit , by the way , four times safely out of every 10 .
we no longer imagine the thing in images things in images , but codify them through language .
and i had a client who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
you &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the corridor .
and then people would be able to eat it and they &apos;d be able to not go blind .
because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
&quot; 2.5 what ? what are you feeding ? &quot;
and then we started negotiating with the islanders .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
i play to explain what these tones might have meant .
so you &apos;re helping out there , just ask the people .
but our perception , how it deceives us too .
and other another example are the ambient , intelligent systems .
how many doors does the house you live in have ?
we think it &apos;s clean -- smells good , too .
i believe this and i feel that we must teach it .
and i would imagine that a lot of you have too .
some people were disappointed there was not poetry .
i sent her home without speaking to my attending .
the cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year .
we have to engage with the machinery of government .
there &apos;s the a direct returning system for this .
procuring software usually takes a couple of years .
and sure , we could find fast food chains .
cats were watching other cats watch this video .
so where would you put your brain on this scale ?
and what i realized is i needed an expert .
looks pretty much like old-style assembly language .
i only wish i could see my kids grow up .
and some of the ice is over 100,000 years old .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
it has moments of experience , one after the other .
and i talked them into funding an expedition .
we talk about the curse of information overload .
and in berlin there was this crazy engineering collective .
it will lose half of its value in one year .
so how do you start speaking the language of music ?
so they go around and do art installations like this .
it is that beautiful . it is yours to protect . &quot;
and i was shocked and shaken to the core .
i walked through the emergency department on my way home .
and she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
and i mention that because i think identity is really important .
because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves .
in fact , their life depended on doing the job .
and these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of .
i knew she had come to say goodbye .
because we don &apos;t just enjoy now , we participate .
the typical walmart today offers you 100,000 products .
do you know how many choices you make in typical week ?
i mean , this is just my logical side talking .
so what i &apos;m telling you here is something truly fantastic .
now the example i showed you was all about finding details .
he said he didn &apos;t know . he would ask around .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
if it stopped twitching , you bury them .
wouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes ?
which would you like , if you could have just one ?
so again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
i say we are ready for our own epic game .
now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
when we looked at how feelings , vary with income .
and this is a bit hard to justify i think .
there weren &apos;t christmas trees . we made it all .
and we shouldn &apos;t : our health care system sucks .
imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality .
this tool that i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
look to miguel , farmers like miguel .
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals ?
but if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
words , for so long his friends , now mocked him .
and what we found was that indeed there was a correlation .
do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
so the leading force behind that is the cyber superpower .
i &apos;ve not had a fight with my wife in two years .
the pilot lines up the plane with the hudson river .
the epiphany is that death is a part of life .
that &apos;s what keeps us going and keeps us developing .
but there was always a life cycle to their presentations .
it &apos;s about 120 feet above the water , or 40 meters .
i wanted to show you the last project we are working on .
you see the person puzzled about what was going on inside .
so i wear two hats in most of what i do .
but it turns out synthesizing dna is very difficult .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we think of our future as anticipated memories .
now , the remembering self is a storyteller .
what it had ruined were the memories of the experience .
i will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
there &apos;s step-by-step instructions on this .
here &apos;s what happened : not one team had a standing structure .
a fish farm , but also a bird sanctuary .
this second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
that first one , it was more like a passionate affair .
he &apos;ll be very happy because he &apos;s deceived you .
because music is a language and music is there to communicate something .
and it &apos;s the first question to ask is what is right .
but for now i &apos;ll just keep up the suspense .
and i started to think i should just dump this project .
of course we can look at the issue of waste first of all .
and i don &apos;t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .
and if you don &apos;t , someone can steal it from you .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of choices .
now it &apos;s only at precise times when they align .
if the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
so you can ask : how happy is the experiencing self ?
most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self .
please , don &apos;t tell me there are no consequences to these things .
has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles ?
and so the question is : can you actually get that to zero ?
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
but of course it &apos;s the sum of a whole load of ideas .
and she asked him , so what are your hobbies ?
that too , so you can get back those things in any shop .
so the question is , how should we deal with nappies ?
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
so , for example , protect the environment , drive the car less .
they live lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
so if i put them next to each other , they get interested .
&quot; do i look like i can write down a song right now ?
and she said it was like a thunderous train of air .
i think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs .
and you say , &quot; doc , what should i do ? &quot;
you put a blue to a green , you can make light .
but they don &apos;t perceive what happened before as a loss .
and these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid .
but the point is , we still come to galapagos .
and people started coming in because they were just outraged .
it was the threat of terror that shaped their lives .
it &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
and what &apos;s under that is what we call bureaucracy .
but where would be the nearest aed to help this patient ?
you &apos;ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car .
now don &apos;t get me wrong here , it didn &apos;t go like this .
it &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been preparing for it our whole lives .
but in my humanity , i also allow my ego to get in .
i was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants .
so the awards were like , &quot; oh , this is fantastic . &quot;
think about this as a pixel , a flying pixel .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
this is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
this is going to influence policy , i think , in years to come .
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self .
they darken your urine . they almost never do more than that .
so , normally , most people begin by orienting themselves to the task .
you have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
and interestingly enough , bono is also a ted prize winner .
when you go running , right , every footprint destroys the ground .
if we overshoot , we can pour a little bit back .
the largest mountaintop miner is the head of massey coal .
this is the source of much of the coal in west virginia .
there &apos;s some magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e-book .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
because with marine protected areas , we actually recreate the past .
let me share and close with a story that really got me excited .
i sometimes get out of balance . i &apos;ll end with this story .
and it felt like technology should enable magic , not kill it .
so now we &apos;ve speeded up the time scales once again .
so now , evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds .
here , he &apos;s pointing out a rare black-shouldered kite .
that means that in doing so , we are being useful , not harmful .
we can reduce that by ten percent of course , but what difference would that make ?
the less i think about something so to speak , the more intuitive it is .
i &apos;m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
he said , &quot; we don &apos;t have the death penalty in germany .
car colors , exterior car colors -- i &apos;ve got 56 choices .
it doesn &apos;t , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
now you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real story .
so i like the way you roll , sergey brin . no .
i was given the gift of a miracle , of not dying that day .
this is called the eyewriter , and you can see the description .
this is an average-size greenlandic iceberg .
i mean , what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her ?
and as a general term , we can use the term intersex for this .
so the question is : can we do that ? and i think we can .
you know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen .
let &apos;s call him miguel -- actually his name is miguel .
because it doesn &apos;t know which haystack it should go to first .
then the same thing happens as when you have a good , stimulating conversation .
and i got to tell you , i think that was a huge error .
we take the pictures of those mini-big bangs inside detectors .
this is what economists call a &quot; pareto-improving move . &quot;
i &apos;ll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
we can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
this is an entire book , so this is an example of non-image data .
and of course , we all share the same adaptive imperatives .
and this is exactly what happened with the case of diginotar .
and then we look at cases like what happened in diginotar .
and let me close with three words of my own : i do remember .
innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
i &apos;d like to reintroduce you to a particular aspect of curiosity .
because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow , doesn &apos;t it ?
so ceos , a little bit better than average , but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
and , although it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of concerns about that .
here we have a the proof , by the way , that humans are not pigs .
and this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man .
i don &apos;t know how receptive people are going to be to it , though .
you &apos;ve just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to tempt &apos;s room .
bonobos are , together with chimpanzees , your living closest relative .
the first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity .
they spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures .
the r &amp; amp ; d piece , it &apos;s crazy how little it &apos;s funded .
usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don &apos;t .
now , he &apos;s mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
i &apos;m aware of the breathing of the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
a young lad like that , he &apos;s not interested in putting out fires .
but the question that i kind of want to pose is -- you know , why not ?
probably the best part of it is what &apos;s coming down the pike in health .
this is the kind of innovation , empowered by this technology , that exists today .
and i was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so painful .
we &apos;re trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted .
and that means permissionless , it means open , it means generative .
now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner ?
so now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the moma , again in new york .
tempt &apos;s going to be in the show , which is pretty awesome .
we &apos;re making androgen , and we &apos;re responding to androgens .
when you do break it , i &apos;m going to give you a hundred bucks . &quot;
that is disgraceful , and we should be ashamed of ourselves .
and so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise .
i mean , you &apos;re talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here .
they have a renewable energy share of fifteen percent at the moment .
and they did this using so-called lead maps .
so when klaus says , there is no soul .
so i looked into when things are natural and intuitive .
and they are just the biohackers , individuals .
it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
this hit me when i went to replace my jeans .
he invited over to dinner the king of siam .
but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem .
and that &apos;s happened to me these last six months .
and instead of panicking , he just stopped .
what about contributions we can &apos;t even predict ?
when you look at the people you deal with ..
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
and imagine each of them then controlled by people .
well let me work up some blood for you .
so it &apos;s about effectivity , not efficiency .
new investments to create high-paying jobs .
societal decay . 65 dead .
and that &apos;s my hope , that you will join me in making and playing games like this .
that means that ballplayer batted safely , hit safely three times out of 10 at bats .
there were gray whales in chesapeake bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
and a lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say , &quot; they &apos;re crazy . &quot; that &apos;s good .
a piece of music that is interpreted for the umpteenth time is comparable in this way .
and out of the corner of my eye , i could see this janitor pacing back and forth .
this idea of fireflies in a jar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
so this image , for example , has close to , i think , around 10 billion pixels .
so , i decided i was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 15 .
and here i &apos;ll zoom in a little bit . we &apos;re looking right there in the center .
and in a few short years , lego bricks took place in every household .
and the judge has certified him as an adult , but i see this kid .
and i didn &apos;t learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that i do .
and i &apos;d really love to show you my week &apos;s worth of outfits right now .
56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t result .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-renewing .
i asked him how he became such an expert on fish .
there was the leopoldshafen nuclear research plant .
an anecdote you might know talks about this time .
you no longer need to whistle or sing a song .
and sixteen milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that goes back a lot further , to the pre-industrial cultures .
so that was a very successful hack in my opinion .
i think the price lies at about six hundred dollars or so .
these these networks didn &apos;t really take form until two thousand eight .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
so , this looks like a basketball playoff .
and if we do , can we boot up a chromosome ?
i couldn &apos;t have done better . i didn &apos;t settle .
well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable .
i first ate it at a restaurant in southern spain .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone &apos;s humanity .
it would be so energizing and so empowering .
death penalty in america is defined by error .
turned trashcan on its side . walked home .
this airport alone covers more than 100 square kilometers .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
in my warped little industry , that &apos;s my brand .
so maybe you should put some one before the interview . &quot;
obviously , this cannot be done by a human operator .
here you see a sample of this actual attack code .
we kicked his bed so that he could see out .
we are effectively grading someone &apos;s worth to our community .
we &apos;re using games to escape real-world suffering .
we hate big government . we don &apos;t trust the man .
what about polio ? let &apos;s have that . why not ?
it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you .
the secret is that play is the key to these capacities .
it is actually the true integration of the man and the machine .
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
that really is my skin . that is not a hollywood special effect .
they produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time .
it &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
i grew up on a steady diet of science fiction .
he said , &quot; we farm extensively , not intensively .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
the composer increasingly becomes like a friend you &apos;re living with .
and i &apos;m not so sure they &apos;re going to stick with it .
the interesting thing about this is that i can make a short trip .
then , in my opinion , a really good code was created .
in fact , nasa has shown a lot of this is out there .
you increase paralysis , and you decrease satisfaction .
now , i thought , &quot; how could i really capture this ?
it &apos;s an independent territory . they control all mineral resources .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
the greatest fear was of pirates , rape and death .
so it &apos;s extremely hard to do all of those additions .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this odd country road .
but that being said , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
i brought seven pairs of underpants and that &apos;s it .
but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position .
our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria .
now , the two selves bring up two notions of happiness .
now , the experiencing self lives its life continuously .
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it sucks .
the modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
ah , the majority . that makes me feel very good as a doctor .
so , i take my inspiration from something that happened 2,500 years ago .
that &apos;s my skin right there . this is not a hollywood special effect .
now , what does that have to do with the placebo effect ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources .
it &apos;s a fish farm in the southwestern corner of spain .
then my question is , how professionally competent was this diagnosis ?
the annotated notes have the function of the letters of a language .
what has an influence on our on our thinking and our ability to remember ?
that means they navigated through the use of sound and rhythm .
so that &apos;s just one application among many that you can use .
and then we worked on writing up a kind of code of conduct .
last year at ted i gave an introduction to the lhc .
should i respond to this email ? should i draft this letter ? &quot;
this is what we call , in our lab , sensible design .
54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other .
essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time .
how about a set of voices that have never been heard from before .
how can a judge turn you into something that you &apos;re not ?
in many communities , people had to worry about being lynched .
so find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers .
so for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
possibilities that would not have been allowed were outrageously encouraged .
so a few years ago , i set off to do just that .
ultimately , moving forward , i think we have to embrace fear .
a playful , mindful brand . what is your brand ?
why is it important to reboot ? what does the red represent ?
and now we &apos;ve created a device that has absolutely no limitations .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you actually communicate ? &quot;
well , that night , everybody went to celebrate in the center .
and the great indicator of that , of course , is language loss .
and i had to explain to the journalists there isn &apos;t such a test .
and this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome .
we are evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species .
so , that &apos;s what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student .
it &apos;s stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
and soon after that , i wrote a story about genetically engineered food .
so i want to get in the machine , and i want to go forward .
so i offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team .
one day this mirror says , yes , there is someone fairer than you .
there was no keyboard instrument such as the piano in bach &apos;s time .
you learn to find the tones on the instrument that go with the notes .
even if you were to shoot yourself now , you &apos;d still have emissions .
most of us know most people have heard of this in the context of software .
this is actually live on the web now ; you can go check it out .
it &apos;s our new homeland . it &apos;s called nunavut .
but nothing has been invented that enables me to walk , until now .
and the best part about it is they snap together with magnets .
some of my doozies have been in the last five years .
i looked at his throat , it was a little bit pink .
&quot; well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that tone of voice .
and that &apos;s when i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
that &apos;s where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population .
i was giving some lectures in germany about the death penalty .
a child in india says , &quot; i saw a monkey today . &quot;
now i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
this is my wifi scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
how does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are ?
and when they are compromised , then real bad things can happen .
and that urgency , that purpose , has really changed my life .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
if , in fact , we couldn &apos;t absorb and release phosphorus .
and this piece of 50-year-old technology became the most magical thing to me .
but there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to youtube every minute .
if they could do it for them , surely they could do it for me .
and just like that , one by one , all of these companies suddenly disappeared .
i &apos;m disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults .
remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us are making any money on this thing .
so if we &apos;re able to do something with cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
and so if we think about that , we have an interesting situation on our hands .
and our nation &apos;s really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism .
so we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism .
he said , &quot; bezos , i need you to go into the house .
if you could have any one of these , it would be a very different world .
specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success .
so , the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles .
and , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
we find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are .
that &apos;s the period of time it takes to form most perceptions we have .
that &apos;s our youngest beta tester , down there on the right .
by the end of march the lhc will be intact again .
and that was the message that i absorbed when i was in med school .
do you know what they call a 300 hitter in major league baseball ?
i actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
i think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a liar .
and i actually believe that the ted community needs to be more courageous .
and this has spread just frictionlessly , organically , naturally .
and my friends from honduras asked me to say thank you , ted .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
so ultimately , this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum .
that &apos;s literally covering just like a two and a half-week period .
these people will be married to the film in perpetuity -- forever .
so all of the green areas , these are your target-rich environments .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other one is called &quot; swing . &quot;
the consequence of this is that we &apos;ve unfortunately lost a good deal of our ability to virtualise .
and i got into my car and i was feeling really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
and one of the things that &apos;s emerged in my short time here is that ted has an identity .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make you tired , tired , tired . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work .
and mass incarceration , in my judgment , has fundamentally changed our world .
these are all reality today , and &#91; in &#93; the future , will be evermore possible .
and so , playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation .
on our end we say , the more people you get out of the way , the better .
and people would say , &quot; aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to have any success ?
i still don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
and what i &apos;ve learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous .
and i love this : &quot; watson vanquishes human opponents . &quot;
and i would look at her and i &apos;d smile , but she was very serious .
three months later i had relocated , and the adventure has continued .
it is about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant .
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of grays and stuff like that .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to be able to talk to tony again .
so we want to use this as one of the possible inputs for flyfire .
and the question was : how could technology , new technology , be added to that ?
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick .
and it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
and i played the first movement of the beethoven violin concerto .
that the human descended from apes and we have a shared ancestor .
the loud and soft symbols , f and b , etcetera .
what were their life circumstances , how were the society and the politics of the time ?
on the 10th of september last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
we &apos;ve been giving littlebits to kids and seeing them play with them .
and when i listened to her , she was making a wheezy sound .
and i did well , i graduated with honors , cum laude .
but if i would ask you , how is your wife ?
you collect information about the piece in secondary literature .
today , it has many employees and they can all get involved .
now , what if that picture links to all of your pictures ?
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
but it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does .
because the categories tell me how to tell them apart .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
it &apos;s way above everything that we have ever seen before .
we should be able to rock anything we want to rock .
and i tend to think of it like my shadow .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
so you see what enormous potential for speed there is here .
naturally it &apos;s from asia , in this case from japan .
because a good engineer either built great cars or nuclear plants .
that would be the very beginning of their own musical expression .
you can only have zero emissions if you don &apos;t exist .
she &apos;s okay . the question is whether we will be .
you rented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
the official dogma of all western industrial societies .
&quot; do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot;
we live on a planet 70 percent covered by water .
but just substitute apartment building for cities .
this rule of three contains three theorems .
usually you first learn to read notes in music lessons .
those would just be the letters you learned to write .
tsunami warning . cyber-attacks .
i wanted us to live long and healthy lives .
mark , mark , come back .
in times when it seems least appropriate to play , it might be the times when it is most urgent .
so we don &apos;t have to keep an eye on the people to make sure they do as little evil as possible .
so there &apos;s all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling .
future &apos;s over here . wind , sun , a new energy grid .
they knew all the bits and bites that they had to attack .
it &apos;s when italy won the soccer world cup .
as we look , we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas .
and it was much worse for a than for b , in memory .
and you are asked , &quot; who of them suffered more ? &quot;
we don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
something fake becomes something real because of someone &apos;s perception of it .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
let &apos;s start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
logic does not make any statement about what is valid .
you practically first learn to read before you speak an a word .
to maintain the dialogue , directly with the composer .
this is a very direct way to get back nutrients in agriculture .
a crucial tool in information brokerage has always been stories .
and this trades under the names open knowledge and citizen science .
listen consciously and say whether you like its taste or not .
he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel .
what they need is an environment to be able to do that .
and you make amends and you never make that mistake again .
there &apos;s nanotechnology coming on , nanomaterials .
and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me .
so you agree to dig it out when it snows .
before i close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the london olympics .
it &apos;s both 3d scanning in real time and motion capture .
as the one hat , i do history of anatomy .
well , i think i understand , we hate big pharma .
it &apos;s the last defense before anything enters the body .
and when i say the word justice , this feeling disappears .
why do i demand from my audience that they listen actively ?
if your work bombed , not entirely your fault , you know ?
we know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
and all i can say about this is : why are we fighting it ?
i don &apos;t need to say this , but vaccines are essential .
and so there is a thread of something that i think is appropriate .
and we became a family , over a four-and-half year period .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds .
i said , &quot; don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
it is you can see that it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
you don &apos;t recognize the sense behind the letters until you know the language .
and to see how we process information , how do we absorb information ?
i wrote down four keywords and would like to explain them briefly .
and the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants .
continue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
and neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it .
to put it in context for myself : i was born in 1946 .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
so beyond simple play , littlebits are actually pretty powerful .
and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
because it evokes something that in a sense has been lost .
and this game has been played by university professors and so forth .
this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers .
bryan , you &apos;ve struck a massive chord here .
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
it brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch .
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
we can handle more categories than we can handle choices .
okay . anybody who &apos;s ready to take him up on his offer .
how well do you think you &apos;re doing at managing those choices ?
all parties , all factions in society , backed this .
it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
and if you drill into that , it &apos;s especially the case for men .
because when that water leaves , it dumps out into the atlantic .
if i &apos;m not right , then the chancellor is not a man .
this , by the way , is the most complicated part of my presentation .
and then he said , well , i &apos;m with the fire brigade .
and then they start piling up stones so your view is blocked .
whether the music is too peppery or sweet for your taste .
interpreters are translators of the written notes in resounding music .
because it &apos;s unfriendly to go and take the nutrients with you .
and the most important thing is to look at is the soil first of all .
but now it &apos;s not on the local level , but on the global level .
and that &apos;s that &apos;s the core concern of of biohackers .
and that search has led me to ancient greece and ancient rome .
the answer -- the short answer to all those questions is , &quot; yes . &quot;
writing books is my profession but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i &apos;m a game designer .
and this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
and i think it starts with one physician , and that &apos;s me .
today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that .
and those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better .
and not even like a tech company , but more like the internet itself .
but this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
the smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world .
and we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture .
any one of you could be famous on the internet by next saturday .
meanwhile , i was getting ready to give a talk at tedglobal .

they are building an epic knowledge resource about the world of warcraft .
now this store , it was almost like going to an amusement park .
that &apos;s high-tech agriculture of course , but the plots take care of themselves .
you attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it .
but in our discovery around the world , we have all kinds of other methods .
but there &apos;s a main difference : the transistor was only for experts .
almost a hundred years later in 1947 , lego came up with this .
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
and hence , the enormous role that a marine protected area can play .

and you &apos;d think he was chasing finches , but he wasn &apos;t .
&quot; do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat ? &quot;
by 2020 , that &apos;s going from two billion to five billion internet users .
my story begins right here actually in rajasthan about two years ago .
and there they make great apps , they work with city staffers .
photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
and now there are 10,000 parodies of &quot; friday &quot; on youtube .
and so , we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the leaders of our country . &quot;
he asked octavio to be his chief of staff .
so quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does that do for us ?
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i &apos;m going to tell you about .
but it wasn &apos;t until i turned 30 that i really got what this meant .
if we look ahead , these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible .
these are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world .
we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games .
he took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us .
and they can do it because they don &apos;t link causation and correlation .
we type , we file , we go to dinner . it &apos;s fine .
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics come in different camps .
it &apos;s a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution .
this is an important wish , but it is one i think we can achieve .
the united states now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world .
and then we have to decrease our must-run capacities in the network .
two equally large forces with opposite signsnatures will cancel each other out .
because the plant in frankfurt would be the best at winning back phosphorus .
all cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
and there is technology coming online , not 10 , 20 years from now , right now .
that &apos;s not being politically active , that &apos;s being bureaucratically active .
and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to show up looking like a scientist .
anybody who &apos;s paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes .
i grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
so , backing up from there , what should the 2020 report card look like ?
well , how do we boot up a chromosome ? how do we activate this ?
if you want to see the features of this car , you can see it here .
and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
so the hammerheads in the piano are the extensions of my fingers .
so i &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide .
so it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
and also , tan &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row .
now i would like to have my own children , and i wonder about the boat .

the microprocessor is a miracle . the personal computer is a miracle .
nasa has this phrase that they like : &quot; failure is not an option . &quot;
that feed conversion ratio ? 2.5 to one , &quot; he said .
and in fact , lots of people , scientists , will contest that it was really different .
these centrifuges in iran are subdivided into 15 , what is called , stages .
this has been digitizing everything , knowledge , and making that accessible through the internet .
which of course very much accommodates for storytelling , and it &apos;s a computer game .
this is an amazing device , but it &apos;s the equivalent of an etch a sketch .
and so we decided that we were going to sponsor tony , tempt , and his cause .
and , needless to say , thank god i wasn &apos;t using a thesaurus back then .
before we had awesome game controllers , we had sheep &apos;s knuckles .
from the point of view of the experiencing self , clearly , b had a worse time .
and it just sits there and burns for the 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
and so i want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .

when i thought about my grandmother , of course she would think all her grandkids were special .
and over 10,000 aeds already in the netherlands already have been submitted .
as some of you might know , i &apos;ve got more than 4,000 followers on twitter .
and then here &apos;s a really , really big close-up of the little piece of metal .
this is &quot; the ambassadors , &quot; based in the national gallery .
today , more than ever , a little honesty is going to go a long way .
and just like that , the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality .
endings are very , very important and , in this case , the ending dominated .
the knife , which you can examine ; my hand , which you could examine .
i really do believe that , and , no , it ain &apos;t wishful thinking .
now that &apos;s back from high school algebra , but let &apos;s take a look .
and the answer is that until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
and from these , i can drill into the web page and just launch them again .
drug war . mass destruction . tornado .
people are always upset when i say , &quot; cut . &quot;
they probably even know the shoe size of the operator .
he said , &quot; well , you wouldn &apos;t remember meeting me .
this is about moving genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
there will be a whole load of resistance and arguments .

so the alliance for climate protection has launched two campaigns .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
and i remember watching a kid playing on a car stop .
imagine a big explosion as you climb through 3,000 ft .

that &apos;s headed up to about nine billion .
he &apos;s interested in setting fires .
century .
you could try and expand the capacity by doing additions on all the existing apartments .
but with this logic , which just uses the fact that two theorems are logically correct and attaches a third one , which looks like it has something to do with the others , we can save our lie .
according to which logic do we disseminate this deception , this self-deception , this willingness to present a reality that &apos;s different from the reality we know is valid in our unconscious minds ?
it breathes this uranium as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a candle .
for each american , it &apos;s about 20 tons ; for people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one ton .

it &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine ?
she wasn &apos;t going to vaccinate her kid against polio , no way .
so , isn &apos;t that interesting ? that high stakes have a strong impact .
and , instead of dealing just with information , we can tease out knowledge .
so i can drill into what i &apos;ve done over specific time frames .
we &apos;re not realists , us foodies ; we &apos;re lovers .
he said , &quot; no ; they do it because the food &apos;s better . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world unto ourselves .
i &apos;d now like to present to you what we found out at our institute .
the constant flooding of music today is not very beneficial there .
aren &apos;t you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you ?

but the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful .
that meant he was instantly killed at the time of the chinese invasion .
we did a game called superstruct at the institute for the future .
and it worked for a while , until i met mrs. drucker .
that each of us is more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .

he just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people .
i &apos;ve left out tide , geothermal , fusion , biofuels .
and i can sort of replay some stuff that i was looking at earlier today .
that &apos;s the one that relies on two billion years of on-the-job experience .
we have thirty gigawatt of photo-voltaic power in germany .
and with this battery we can switch it on and off once for two milliseconds .

they go from low choice to high choice , they &apos;re hanging in there .
they &apos;ve actually built two cities already in china and are preparing the third .
one big spoonful at a time , we have to embrace risk .

but really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today .
what scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it ?
and if you &apos;re wondering about those other spikes , those are also fridays .
because that &apos;s what you do when your name is yosemite mountain bear .
three things : tastemakers , communities of participation and unexpectedness .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator ?
now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cracks .
that &apos;s not at all what my creative process is -- i &apos;m not the pipeline !
this is not an electron micrograph ; this is just a regular photomicrograph .
they had sold this tool for 280,000 euros to the egyptian government .
how can i teach them about what i did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
she &apos;s doing a lot better this year . she &apos;s on the comeback trail .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what are you doing in this courtroom ? &quot;
we do . as rational as we are , as committed to intellect as we are .
and that was democracy growing up , but it was also science growing up at the same time .
some of you might be thinking , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time to spend playing games .
i would clean off my arm , and i would show you that there are no wounds .
and the people in the back go , &quot; ok , i didn &apos;t really see that . &quot;
and with each version , kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
so , filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
he asked me what the preamble to this ballad was in my opinion .
then i will say , in my own words , what could be written within this framework .
and it &apos;s also interesting that they &apos;re also represented in south-east-asia .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
and i promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked .
it &apos;s a lobster made of playdough that &apos;s afraid of the dark .
lights , sounds , solar panels , motors -- everything should be accessible .
among those papers , was this binder entitled &quot; finfisher . &quot;
i was there because i grew up in europe and i wanted later to work in africa .
he had a potentially life-threatening condition called epiglottitis .
underpinning much of this is technology , and of late , exponentially growing technologies .
i said , &quot; yes , sir . i did . &quot; and we started arguing .
so this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism .
and you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crowd-sourcing .
because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
every single harvard employee is now automatically enrolled in a lifecycle fund .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceo &apos;s say it .
we have to face the consequences , and we better start to prepare right now .
well today , for the first time , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
namely to lie in such a way that you can simply implement this logic in the wrong way .
traditionally , in the discussion about the environment , there is the belief that there are too many of us on this planet .
and these two worlds , the old and the new ways of thinking , are clashing with each other at the moment .
but even i , in my mulishness , even i have brushed up against that thing , at times .
and because of that , we really haven &apos;t understood what it &apos;s meant to do the things we &apos;ve done historically .
they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart .
he was just a toddler and he wasn &apos;t very good at it , and he kept falling over .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so this , to me , was an astonishing thing .
so , in your mind , timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live ?
but at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing .
in this country , as many as 24,000 canadians die of preventable medical errors .
this is a map that grows and glows and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book .
so we &apos;re in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better , faster , stronger .
and in doing so , they were really setting up in a beautiful way the civil rights movement of the future .
co2 is warming the planet , and the equation on co2 is actually a very straightforward one .
that &apos;s equivalent to the output of one hundred nuclear power plants , because it is converted particularly quickly .
each of these has four different variations , you get to choose which one you want to use .
you can also try it with words like revenge or acquisitiveness and the like .
that means we do not need to keep an eye on people so that they do as little evil as possible .
and then it goes back to the back and it &apos;s not until then that whatever it is is actually seen .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
and over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
well , you would know something about his height , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land .
it killed like 90 percent of the birds , which , for this place , is a lot of birds .
we were only a group of five people at the time , that could that could rebuild the <<unk>> .
and i &apos;m afraid of many , many more things besides that people can &apos;t even guess at .
but the king of siam , he was fed with aluminum utensils .
and we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo .
and gamers are willing to work hard all the time , if they &apos;re given the right work .
because i had to , at a certain point , say , &quot; what am i doing out here ?
and if we can do this for raw data , why not do it for content as well ?
well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economically .
and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to .
she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family .
but on citizens connect everything is public , so everybody can see this .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buying a car .
well our objects , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
if you think you look good in something , you almost certainly do .
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
no fear , no agony . polio -- puff , gone .
so i can step back , pop right back into a specific section .
i &apos;m only showing the top 500 most popular wikipedia pages right here .
they raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands .
there are still six hundred billion trees in the amazon forest alone .
if i start you off easy , i learn how to choose .
she saved my life ; i and my partner saved hers .
there are some innovations in nuclear : modular , liquid .
a project i recently started was the building of a gene gun .
this is a highly useless categorization scheme .
it evolved to soak up impurities . &quot;
i &apos;m surprised that people often forget something very elementary .
you study works that have been composed before or after .
it turned blue because of the genes we put in it .
what about me ? what about a regular guy ?
and for them language had inferior importance .
and it also involved new choices for leaders .
you see it straight away .
it &apos;s incredible . you know , you look around , you go , &quot; oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot;
and when you are with people who are firmly convinced that you have a soul , or , you might say , who believe that the soul brought us to life , then imagine something along these lines : the soul is an incorporeal framework around you , and it &apos;s not material , and you are just made of flesh and blood , are solid , so to speak , bound to the earth , ephemeral , subject to decay , insignificant , dead really .
the first project that we did as an international group , when we became aware of ourselves , you might say , okay we exist as a real <<unk>> scene <<unk>> , and we &apos;re online , and we we know the people who are always chatting there and everything .
so it attaches a third theorem to it , that has nothing to do with the first two theorems and only acts as if the opposite of the first theorem had already been proven and given priority .
i said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t feel right about that . y &apos;all go ahead . y &apos;all go ahead . &quot;
so i &apos;m actually just going to go in and launch khoya , an interactive app for the ipad .
and we often went into just a dead end and had to recover .
it &apos;s exciting every time , because i read something new in it every time .
because they changed their chairman of the board of directors twice now .
this , all over the country , is the second largest waste stream in america .
i think it &apos;s better if we encourage our great creative minds to live .
the idea behind littlebits is that it &apos;s a growing library .
a big fishery was run on it until the &apos; 80s .
i talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill .
i had some , your sister had some . have some beer . &quot;
now that &apos;s why , for instance , antibiotic resistance has evolved .
and that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years .
they &apos;re using their hands to write applications that make government work better .
so what we did , we crowdsourced the netherlands .
we told her stories and assured her that we were still with her .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re mutually exclusive or anything .
but suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality , something suddenly changes .
it &apos;s no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse .
so we do need target theories that we can prove or disprove .
the idea behind the stuxnet computer worm is actually quite simple .
and more than anything , are you being the best parent you can ?
i don &apos;t want to say we give up entirely on anatomy .
and he was born looking like a boy -- nobody suspected anything .
but it is also the aging population that is multiplying in numbers .
we can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times .
now , the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories .
i &apos;ve brought along a project i &apos;d like to introduce to you .
that means you can see how to win back nutrients on the internet .
america is in crisis -- the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
it didn &apos;t -- that chemical engineering block john , how &apos;s it going ?
you know , i never thought that i &apos;d end up working at microsoft .
but the waorani didn &apos;t just spear outsiders .
threats , in the wake of bin laden &apos;s death , have spiked .
and in our western world we were always too stupid to bring back our nutrients .
and suddenly i have an interface that is considerably more intuitive and natural .
the law of proximity , the law of of continuity , etc .
like steve jobs once said : you need to dig deeper to understand how it works .
of course this virtual world exists within the walls of our cities , that &apos;s obvious .
and now i &apos;ll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression .
the united states is one of the two largest emitters , along with china .
if you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing .
not the work , the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever .
you &apos;ve seen recently , corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment .
so we can use the genetic code to write out words , sentences , thoughts .
i want to start with what i call the &quot; official dogma . &quot;
christianity , islam , buddhism , judaism , whatever .
littlebits are electronic modules with each one specific function .
these people represent tens of trillions of dollars injected into the global economy .
the spinning reserve has at least ten seconds to keep the network stable .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? have some beer . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side .
we choose not to choose , even when it goes against our best self-interests .
but you didn &apos;t need it to describe the large , everyday objects around us .
well i had a unique seat that day . i was sitting in 1d .
and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more .
imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel .
and the plastic bottle we &apos;re throwing away every day still stays there .
as a consequence , the body develops more along the female typical path .
adversity is just change that we haven &apos;t adapted ourselves to yet .
so , again , transformation , adaptation , is our greatest human skill .
this is actually me making the &quot; i &apos;m not good at life &quot; face .
no fame , no glory , no money . what are you doing ?
it &apos;s at the tip of the guadalquivir river .
we decided to do a little experiment , and we picked jam for our experiment .
so all of our intelligence amounts to us wanting to be dumber than trees .
that was then replaced by the classical age and the first type of abstraction .
it &apos;s an open-ended story , and he gets to decide how it unfolds .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this state-of-the-art clean coal facility .
this is the kangerlussuaq river in southwest greenland .
should i get married later ? should i have kids first , or a career first ? &quot;
and it &apos;s literally , hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it .
and we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment .
we need to find ways to embrace these challenges , these problems , the suffering .
now if i look at those programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
this is a generation that &apos;s grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted .
so he did what any good developer would do , he wrote an app .
if there is a sinew in our family , it runs through the women .
at 17 she became the second wife of a mandarin whose mother beat her .
you know , the average grocery store today offers you 45,000 products .
that makes the baby carbon-positive for its whole life , right from the beginning .
went in , and i started noticing that these kids were actually beating something .
there &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story and there &apos;s the real story . &quot;
as an iceberg melts , i am breathing in its ancient atmosphere .
you see the colosseum in the middle , the river tiber .
this is what , in engineering terms , you would call a real time control system .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s feminine about feminism . &quot;
okay , so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersex .
or perhaps you &apos;re one of those who &apos;s always yearned for more creativity .
not like me -- i &apos;m a game designer ; i &apos;m exuberant .
there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also destroy it .
and if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there &apos;s wisdom to be found .
it came to the table a bright , almost shimmering , white color .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
the so , music functions a lot like spoken language in my opinion .
they use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
and the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world .
the brown bit is the conventional system so to speak , the green bit is our system .
she likes him a lot , because he has the tendency to be forthright .
and here there &apos;s this story about the wife of the bishop of worcester .
the melody is created through what &apos;s being sung and rhythm is created through dance .
well , so it says presto at the top , so that &apos;s a fast piece .
we tell people , oh well , you people in the south are not environmentally aware .
that means there are not too many of us , we &apos;re just too stupid , you see ?
so we have our eyes at the front and now you think we see from front to back .
twelve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
and so this is live on the web . it &apos;s powered by seadragon .
but you ask the indians , and they say , &quot; the plants talk to us . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t create the distortion of reality ; it creates the dissolution of reality .
here you see , with felt and paper water bottles , we have geordie making ...
here &apos;s vladimir tsastsin form tartu in estonia .
on this island , that &apos;s the island graciosa on azores .
essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down .
and most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other .
and they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydrants .
but if i could give it and still see them safely through , i would .
only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time .
there &apos;s a million a year who leave latin america to go to the united states .
and so i found a company called olson zaltman in pittsburg .
but is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me ?
and that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the jungles of congo .
&quot; that &apos;s fine , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;ll take the soup . &quot;
if you have capsules , they &apos;re more effective than tablets in any form .
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what those reasons are .
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet , they don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
in it , there are always three diesels running , two are always maintained .
you really want to get the decision right if it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
now before we started our session this afternoon , i had a chat with gary .
i believe that when you push people away from that , you &apos;re pushing them more towards failure .
these are choices that your grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to have before them .
if you ask for the happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
but that &apos;s not really what this is about . right ? and then i open my hand up .
so the question you want to ask is : how come ? why ? what is it about them ?
i worked in the collective for eleven years , it was based on a grassroots democracy .
and she said i should perhaps present my island project , which i will try to present to you .
i took the liberty i asked lilly , if it would be okay to mention her .
we use our vocal chords to to sing , and our hands and feet to dance .
so , as a designer , i design behaviour much more much more often than appearance .
and and you need to do it and understand it if you want to do it and understand it .
and what what are our values and what are what are our objectives , our fundamental principles ?
so it was curiosity and i somehow wanted to get closer to the material , that was it .
in the andes , this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city .
in terms of the other self , the remembering self , you get a different story .
we &apos;ve also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of the guardian .
and yet , 46 percent of all homicide cases don &apos;t result in arrest .
and in fact , sometimes it takes it by methods that we don &apos;t quite even understand .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
it &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
i think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
... doesn &apos;t have to be fear . what kind of roller coaster are you on ?
so even with that caveat , i knew that someone would buy the naming rights .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate everything back .
our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
they played dice games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
these are ancient dice , made out of sheep &apos;s knuckles . right ?
so , the big question is , &quot; what exactly are gamers getting so good at ? &quot;
so , you would have heard of his theory of success , the 10,000 hour theory of success .
this is a gamer who is on the verge of something called an epic win .
in the past , our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead .
and i get a lot of people asking me : &quot; what do you get for 10 billion pixels ? &quot;
that number &apos;s rising , and it &apos;s rising really rapidly , and it &apos;s disgraceful .
they talk about it , they figure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they jockey for power .
right away , we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on wikipedia .
and i &apos;ve been representing these kids who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences .
we want to imagine epic wins , and then give people the means to achieve the epic win .
and then on the next day , they would play games ; and on the next day , they would eat .
we can also add a photo voltaic output of two hundred kilowatt + to the network .
once it &apos;s played free of mistakes , the student gets their next piece to learn , which is slightly harder .
they &apos;re on the rubbish tips , but also elsewhere in the landscape , right ?
and those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense , those little drops of oil .
instead of sending them off into the third world , we send them into the wilds of city hall .
nobody knew where the nearest life-saving aed was to be obtained right now .
so &quot; nyan cat &quot; is a looped animation with looped music .
they didn &apos;t think of it that way , but they did it for us , and it was great .
we &apos;ll just -- we can just skip -- i &apos;ll just skip through the video instead ...
oh , you &apos;ve heard of that . ok , good , so we have some gamers among us .
ok , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be chez panisse , but it would be nice .
doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year .
now , when i use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .
and the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship .
so i want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that &apos;s a little bit crazy .
really , you &apos;d have to prove , first of all , whether there is something like a free will .
you introduce a new idea and this is answered instantaneously with a reaction .
you can explain this much more elaborately later on , as there &apos;s more much more to this .
and , if this is true , and i think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
when they came in 100 flavors , damn it , one of them should &apos;ve been perfect .
and i thought about it and i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
at the end of that , i end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers .
they were there in february , and it snowed a lot in february last year .
i said , &quot; what percentage of your feed is chicken ? &quot;
it &apos;s what we believe about people when we name them with these words .
and no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk .
why do we need to prevent people from finding out something that is true ?
so the it &apos;s not as efficient , but it &apos;s basically doable .
frosty the coal man is a jolly , happy soul .
last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance .
we &apos;re limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination .
i no longer try to be right ; i choose to be happy .
we barely break even . there is no fame in it .
so , okay , to hack into biology , you need material .
we have seven million people on probation and parole .
imagine the first piece : a man burning his life &apos;s work .
and i would love for ceg to help make it happen .
but the coolest i ever worked on was around this guy .
those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure .
that &apos;s the medium of print with gutenberg and others .
my brand is fedex because i deliver the goods .
evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment .
i know you did because half of americans do every day .
and indeed they should . these are important questions to answer .
or anything that i imagine because they might have thought .
failed writer-alcoholic brand .
this is harder to check or bring down .
now we have the third theorem .
so you sense it already .
i think if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t belong to them , they &apos;re not just a thief .
it would be unconscionable for us to , in an intentional and deliberate way , set about executing people . &quot;
all the rest of that day , that afternoon , i had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach .
and similar to &quot; double rainbow , &quot; it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere .
and i think some companies will just focus on one of their strengths or the other instead of focusing on both .
and as a matter of fact , this fake input data is actually prerecorded by stuxnet .
in the united states , the institute of medicine pegged it at 100,000 .
it &apos;s because of what happened in 1776 with the founding fathers .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , choosing to have more males than females .
it &apos;s the finite resource that we &apos;re spending while we &apos;re on this earth .
you &apos;re not entitled to your own facts . sorry , you &apos;re not .
designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process .
and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while .
he looked at me like i had just quoted a whitney houston song .
we negotiated with investors , i looked for new shareholders .
the next generation of graphic user interfaces already works with behaviour a lot more .
those wires carry 13 thousand amps when the machine is working in full power .
the only real choice was who , not when , and not what you did after .
think of this as the long tail to stephen lawler &apos;s virtual earth work .
and rick szeliski at microsoft research . a very nice collaboration .
this is a project called photosynth , which really marries two different technologies .
this young man &apos;s father had been ascribed to the panchen lama .
not surprisingly , this destruction also endangers bonobo survival .
and then at my worst moments : why did i make such a stupid mistake ?
what is the machete ? what pupa stage are you in now ?
now i want to share with you three things i learned about myself that day .
i could see in her eyes , it was terror . life was over .
i just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival .
this is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shortage .
it will be really important . it will be a great marketing hook . &quot;
and for nathaniel , music brought him back into a fold of friends .
buridan &apos;s ass is an ass that is made purely of nature .
using a kind of torch , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
that is i think they are less people have registered than actually exist .
it &apos;s such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope .
i did better . all this choice made it possible for me to do better .
we &apos;re near the end , we &apos;re getting close to the world series .
the other place that &apos;s very interested in city building is singapore .
it &apos;ll save the lives of 400 to 500,000 kids in the developing world every year .
this may sound strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of the concrete block .
but here , here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance .
he said , &quot; oh , mama tells all the grandkids that they &apos;re special . &quot;
and the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
like most adults on the boat , my mother carried a small bottle of poison .
so we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
are you something that &apos;s a little more calm , reserved , conservative ?
i love this picture , because this is someone else &apos;s room and that &apos;s his room .
with this information we realized there &apos;s a lot of inefficiencies in the system .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , then you &apos;d win the race .
and if you don &apos;t think you look good in something , you &apos;re also probably right .
exactly one week &apos;s worth of undies is all i put in my suitcase .
so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability .
it &apos;s true , we &apos;ve got a huge food problem , but this isn &apos;t science .
you take them away , disease comes back , horrible diseases . and that &apos;s happening .
now this brand , the qualcomm stadium , the staples center ...
a big machine , a cool , ted-ish machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
so , that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it .
so what we &apos;re looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age .
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no impurities . &quot;
must-run simply means the power plant is running too to keep up the frequency .
so , you don &apos;t abstain from food just because you can &apos;t cook .
in israel people say , if you save a human life , you &apos;re saving the world .
there are indicator functions , where i know exactly where i have to look .
these organisms can be totally desiccated ; they can live in a vacuum .
it makes points about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things slowly .
very quickly concrete blocks became the most-used construction unit in the world .
and you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases ?
16 terawatts of energy hits the earth &apos;s surface every 88 minutes .
he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , did you write this crazy motion ? &quot;
we went to san paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same .
we want to make every single interaction in the world into a ready-to-use brick .
and he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this holler .
they tell me to say , &quot; no , tell them that we grew up with that . &quot;
in the possibilities of linking together magic , the earth and technology , there are multiple possibilities .
and so over here you need to tilt your ipad , take the fireflies out .
it &apos;s a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
or to build a dozen of these , or a hundred of these , around the world ?
this is a representation of your brain , and your brain can be broken into two parts .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other targets might be hit by stuxnet .

and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they resigned themselves to what was happening .
your skin cell is really useless without a heart cell , muscle cell , a brain cell and so on .
and so the film explores this whole idea -- it &apos;s what ? in perpetuity , forever ?
for better or worse , and sooner than you may think , these choices will be up to us .
consider , first , the reality that people today , in some cultures , are making choices about their offspring .
and the &quot; a students &quot; get the tougher curriculum , the best teachers , etc .
and those are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both lumped in the notion of happiness .
is there some kind of natural illustration , some demonstration that would grab people &apos;s imagination here ? &quot;
and that night , i was lying in bed , and i thought : what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
that means the first impression comes to us at an extremely high speed , the way we perceive things .
and i started to notice a few things that make epic wins so possible in online worlds .
you don &apos;t want to pick the wrong mutual fund , or even the wrong salad dressing .
and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less diligent .
and the doc says , &quot; a has these benefits and risks , and b has these benefits and risks .
this is matthew anderson , tariq al-daour and so on and so on .
we adjust our baseline to the new level , and we don &apos;t recall what was there .
you see , scarcity is contextual , and technology is a resource-liberating force .
now the amygdala is our early warning detector , our danger detector .
the politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
i think it &apos;s very haughty of us to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
even in the first seven days , there was one parody for every other day of the week .
so what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in honduras ?
i feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks .
first , it &apos;s a ball game bonobo-style -- and i do not mean football .
but otherwise , you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria , just as they are essential to your life .
and so , recently , scientists have suggested that herodotus &apos; crazy story is actually true .
but what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie , geeky internet culture .
and , listen , everyone &apos;s entitled to their opinion ; they &apos;re even entitled to their opinion about progress .
some of what i &apos;ve worked on is people who have dwarfism -- so people who are much shorter than typical .
and it &apos;s because of the experiences i &apos;ve had with them , not in spite of the experiences i &apos;ve had with them .
and , in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they &apos;re going out and reading their school work under the street lamps .
it &apos;s become , today , the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of europe . &quot;
and that &apos;s for us humans , something is intuitive when there &apos;s an as little as possible a need to think about it .
and when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
in fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
she was born in the 1880 &apos;s and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world .
this didn &apos;t really sit well with my intuition , and maybe it &apos;s just because i don &apos;t play with particles very often .
i &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favorites , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
in fact , the exact meaning of the word &quot; educate &quot; comes from the root word &quot; educe . &quot;
and in the next decade we &apos;re going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is .
all of those photos become linked together , and they make something emergent that &apos;s greater than the sum of the parts .
and if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
and the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us , inspires and unites us .
and i &apos;ll show just a few examples -- again , with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it .
and dr. p always wore really colorful bow ties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children .
it &apos;s a really , this graph , well i &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have slides .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art . &quot;
and when you have one hundred percent renewable energies , then it &apos;s like a self-sufficient system .
but also , we &apos;re now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vaccines .
and the shopkeeper said , &quot; do you want slim fit , easy fit , relaxed fit ?
i mean , how many of you saw the winning of jeopardy by ibm &apos;s watson ?
now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics .
we look , for example , about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
it might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase , &quot; she &apos;s got him by the balls . &quot;
working with universities all over sub-saharan africa , and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills .
this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
well this is such a powerful image in their mind , it &apos;s so much stronger than the white pill .
well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the intermediate .
but at the time multi-celled organisms come online , things start to change .
but now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess .
there i think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap , and simulation .
there &apos;s been this huge decline in crime in america over the last three decades .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iphone or something or other .
and the fundamental lesson , i believe , is that design truly is a contact sport .
but what i wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep .
or better : how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself ?
no , not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ? &quot;
vicious cartels . announcer five : caustic cruise lines .
and i think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one .
we need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act quick enough .
so we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
that &apos;s the planet we live on . don &apos;t pretend it isn &apos;t .
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agribusiness model for the future .
and they &apos;re designed in such a way that a farmer can farm them easily .
the brand that i am is , i would call it casual fly .
i learned it myself from cub scout magic in the 1970s .
within a year , you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins .
and the child will play , after thinking for a moment .
virtuality has suddenly become something alien to us
we can &apos;t just do that .
now , unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems .
climate skeptics : if you had a sentence or two to say to them , how might you persuade them that they &apos;re wrong ?
by the way , about one hundred gigawatts electrical output on diesel fuel basis is added in the world per year .
what they mean to me now , what they meant to the composer at the time and what they might have meant to them now .
steve pinker has showed us that , in fact , we &apos;re living during the most peaceful time ever in human history .
i need you to go upstairs , past the fire , and i need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
the day before the event , i called the head of p.r. for the company .
but how is it with with virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world ?
if they get surrounded , they notice that too , they might get a little flustered .
i teach wonderfully intelligent students , and i assign 20 percent less work than i used to .
the second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
we want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .
before i actually begin the meat of my talk , let &apos;s begin with a bit of baseball .
three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
if you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it normally goes .
the categories need to say something to the chooser , not the choice-maker .
now this might sound preposterous to you if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
friday : a universal truth -- five words for you : gold sequins go with everything .
he understood that there &apos;s a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
so three very tough problems that might be solvable , and so , should be worked on .
instead of pushing water out , they used the channels to pull water back in .
you need this lie to keep this sham , this self-deception , upright .
so it &apos;s about leaving leaving a large footprint , which will turn into wetland .
you &apos;ll never forget it again , because i &apos;m showing where the dalmatian is .
and one reason is , this enormous heat sink heats up greenland from the north .
and you cannot understand the pain of tibet until you move through it at the ground level .
whether it &apos;s the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant .
and this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
add this buzzer for some extra punch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine .
i spend most of my time in jails , in prisons , on death row .
and i think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of curve .
and for example , the most sophisticated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
are you an up attribute ? are you something that gets the blood flowing ?
now look at what happened that day just by monitoring activity happening on the network .
and i thought , &quot; well that &apos;s the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
don &apos;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
so i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done some work .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe .
this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition .
if dan were a brand , he might be a classic convertible mercedes benz .
what would you get done that you &apos;re waiting to get done because you think you &apos;ll be here forever ?
and as we &apos;re coming down , i had a sense of , wow , dying is not scary .
and after , as i reflected on that , i decided to eliminate negative energy from my life .
now you might think that all this breaking-down of categories would make somebody like me really happy .
in that case , what i &apos;ve worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norms .
for us and them , play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance .
they help in the digestion of essential nutrients , and they protect you against certain diseases .
these are our virtuoso gamers , 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something .
you guys have heard of leveling up and plus-one strength , and plus-one intelligence .
this is going to be , i think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics .
this is really my flesh . this is not damian &apos;s special-grown flesh .
when paul speaks in a public hearing , he can &apos;t testify without armed guards .
but these stories bothered me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i did .
because with pigs , phosphorus is released in their solid components faeces .
for the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the seas like we clear-cut forests .
think of this : we have a four-letter genetic code -- a , c , g and t .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who aren &apos;t new yorkers , i apologize .
and you will have noticed that the hues and tones are like &quot; avatar . &quot;
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year .
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs to build them .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy it &apos;s been mentioned so much here today .
this can be , in our case , we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol .
when you turn on the light , actually you see this . so the same as we saw before .
imagine your screen could just appear in different scales or sizes , different types of resolution .
so , i &apos;ve started to think about what these games are making us virtuosos at .
and if you want the ultimate in placebo , you &apos;ve go to the needle .
and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions .
they do that because they &apos;re able to follow the broken white line of highway a92 .
i &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s some sort of pull to nostalgia , to wishful thinking .
and now the thing you can almost read daily in the papers is what you find in this third theorem .
another example from a very different field . monet painted his waterlilies an infinite number of times .
and i would please like the record to reflect today that i showed up for my part of the job . &quot;
and this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the genome of phi x174 .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique cadence of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
the only thing that i have done is i have varied the order in which that information is presented .
you &apos;ve heard it said before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , that less is more .
i thought &quot; turn the camera off &quot; meant , &quot; let &apos;s have an off-the-record conversation . &quot;
so for example , the number 164 really stands out in that code ; you can &apos;t overlook it .
no , they didn &apos;t demolish it , just when it goes down , the architecture almost disappears .
if those pixels fall , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text .
our cities , over the past few years , just have been blanketed with networks , electronics .
for bonobos and humans alike , life is not just red in tooth and claw .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for the society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family are choosing .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff , like cassava for instance .
to be part of the constitution , you actually have to pass it twice in the congress .
if you put you put an executive admin. on the team , they get significantly better .
bill gross has several companies , including one called esolar that has some great solar thermal technologies .
one is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant .
that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna .
we just wanted to know what would happen with a normal , run-of-the-mill electrochemical battery .
a tv or a washing machine , those are things you just use , you don &apos;t expend them .
the arctic ice cap is , in a sense , the beating heart of the global climate system .
the more i thought about it , however , the more i came to the view that this fish knows something .
and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
we &apos;re trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice .
and it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken .
but now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology .
and so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started abstracting out .
that &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six-inch layer on top .
at the end of each day , i made a huge pot of soup which we all shared .
something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice , as this slide is meant to indicate .
and so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world , unless you &apos;re a particle physicist .
whether it &apos;s a &quot; floral fusion &quot; or a &quot; paradise winds , &quot; they &apos;ll have their chance .
no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be as a determinant in the quality of someone &apos;s life .
so by shaking the siftables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- woof !
now in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and i don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care .
so i felt like our cellphones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming .
how do we keep you fresher longer -- better freshness , more freshness , three times fresher .
and the adrenal glands make androgens , which are a masculinizing hormone .
i was the second volunteer on the scene , so there was a pretty good chance i was going to get in .
and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly , but they are inexorable .
gamers love to be attached to awe-inspiring missions to human planetary-scale stories .
and so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers .
you see , there are two countries that control almost seventy percent of the phosphorus reservoirs worldwide .
in in china a a chamber pot is still called a honey pot , you could say , right ?
it took several stages , in fact , starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
and it took a lot of preparation , we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things .
but , what makes voodoo so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
because , obviously , an animal that is very abundant , before it gets extinct , it becomes rare .
and sometimes when it comes through ted , it has meaning and power that it doesn &apos;t have when it doesn &apos;t .
and so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away and read the rest of the book .
now i &apos;m an optimist , so i sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .
they &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipulated .
and the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing , but you know what ?
now just to give you some perspective , i &apos;m going to zoom out so you really see what you get .
so as part of that , they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatomical commonality .
or , are we destined to become something different -- something , perhaps , even better adapted to the environment ?
i really hope that we can come together to play games that matter , to survive on this planet for another century .
it &apos;s absolutely astonishingly cold and soul-bending to those of us who can even afford it .
we &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
the idea here is obviously not only to fool the operators in the control room .
here &apos;s some very cool stuff that we saw -- really knocked my socks off .
the gray boxes don &apos;t run windows software ; they are a completely different technology .
now when i was a freshman in college , i took my first biology class .
and half of the wastewater problem worldwide is caused by the textile industry .
this one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us .
we have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country .
it &apos;s necessary to always use what you would call political correctness here .
we have to prevent people from finding about things , especially when they &apos;re true .
making it differently or prettier doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s easier to use .
and now let &apos;s reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best .
his mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy .
somehow she found time to study english and gain it qualifications .
famine in somalia . police pepper spray .
but that &apos;s not true , we have seven percent in europe and our network is , if you look at it physically , the european one .
you know , what i do is write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most widely read children &apos;s author , in fact .
the next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea .
we had the age of feudalism , we have had the machine age and we are now stepping into the so-called cyber age .
now as i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to have some questions for you and i &apos;m going to want to know your answers .
so , for better or for worse , aquaculture , fish farming , is going to be a part of our future .
in both cases , these are gross underestimates , because we really aren &apos;t ferreting out the problem as we should .
and at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- mrs. drucker , a wife , a mother and a grandmother .
and also , even though it &apos;s plotted on a log curve on the left , it &apos;s curving upwards .
michael j. nelson from mystery science theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on twitter .
in order for us to understand each other , i want to start by showing you a rudimentary , very simple magic trick .
and so , you &apos;re seeing animals that are living next to a 500-degree-centigrade you think they can &apos;t possibly exist .
so through this mode of passing on the burden of proving something you are experiencing the brilliance of the lie .
already in some shallow lakes in alaska , methane is actively bubbling up out of the water .
for her , life had distilled itself into one task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
and in real life , when we face failure , when we confront obstacles , we often don &apos;t feel that way .
intrinsic to these archaic models is the fact that we have a principally natural relationship with virtuality .
when i was a child , i had multiple collections of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells .
and so because of my interest in the in this technology , i went delved into it more .
we &apos;ve designed an ice cream wrapping , for example , which turns into liquid at room temperature .
unfortunately not the one on offenbach , but perhaps you can give the frankfurters a hand .
in high school , a classmate once said that brian goldman would study for a blood test .
i &apos;m going to focus on one stat that i hope a lot of you have heard of .
so given a dozen news stories , we will preferentially look at the negative news .
and like a lot of people , i thought government was basically about getting people elected to office .
so all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , what would you be ?
so basically this is my point : if you see something that &apos;s not possible , make it possible .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn myself this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
and , perhaps , until we &apos;re tested , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of .
they will say , a person who has no soul is dead and can &apos;t claim anything .
this is called a law of design or gestalt psychology , which in turn affects our perception .
that &apos;s a whole series of things you &apos;re concerned with besides your existence as a designer .
all that calls for the ability , our fundamental ability to accept virtuality as a real living space .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want to tell our story . &quot;
i can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo one way or the other .
this question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer , by building siftables .
say , &quot; computer , would you please make a hundred million random sequences of instructions .
make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team .
and i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .
so maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ...
why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer ?
we know that we are optimized , as human beings , to do hard meaningful work .
and we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the needle .
i brought along an example of the north american tribe of the nootka indians .
maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery .
we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones .
so let &apos;s look at what this last century has been to see where we &apos;re going .
yet i am afraid of privilege , of ease , of entitlement .
so we could easily supply the world with dozens , maybe hundreds , of new cities .
when i went there 27 years later , the fish had shrunk to half of their size .
so , morgan , in the name of transparency , what exactly happened to that $ 7,100 ?
it is almost physiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you &apos;re wearing bright red pants .
will we use these choices to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kinder ?
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your offspring ?
that also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk , so i hope you enjoyed it .
but actually , according to my research at the institute for the future , it &apos;s actually the opposite is true .
nothing goes up or down my sleeve , no trickery . and you can examine everything .
and that &apos;s because those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren &apos;t actually fanatics at all .
you can see it &apos;s a log there , often referred to as a traveling wave reactor .
i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitos , and somehow people enjoyed that .
for the designers it is important , they usually have it in the first term , those great laws of design .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow .
which is great , because the romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
the viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the e. coli .
i &apos;m pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare .
well , but this shows you , in any case , nobody has to be hopeless candidate .
the great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categories .
and this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety .
and police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers .
in fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs i could have ever written by hand .
so to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
and that sadness really framed in one thought , which is , i only wish for one thing .
and that is actually for the last 500 years , since its very successful introduction , i must say .
there is no sitting around wringing your hands , there &apos;s always something specific and important to be done .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
are they saying that there &apos;s negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things ?
that &apos;s sort of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet .
and they actually -- although it &apos;s great they don &apos;t require fuel -- they have some disadvantages .
i &apos;m told they don &apos;t bite ; in fact , they might not even leave that jar .
that &apos;s why many people come and look at it , because you can see what problems will arise .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and the descent of man .
well i adored my mom , so i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation , adapting and surviving through generation after generation .
i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the exception of my physical therapy sessions .
now , if i had ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
people wrap themselves in their beliefs , and they do it so tightly that you can &apos;t set them free .
and so , i thought this was an interesting idea , and i incorporated it into a design workshop .
there &apos;s a liquid-type reactor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
we can see it again here we can see the diesel again here , and all the individual aggregates here .
overview : i &apos;m interacting with the object so to speak , can zoom back out , zoom in .
that might sound mundane at first , but it &apos;s exciting , once you take a closer look at it .
because people often come and ask , can &apos;t you make it more user friendly , so that anybody can use it ?
here we have a word game that &apos;s kind of like a mash-up between scrabble and boggle .
when we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
if you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible , you decrease satisfaction .
if i were to walk into a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think of me .
and i finally decided , oh gosh , i &apos;ve got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
there was also recently a study done with ceos in which they followed ceos around for a whole week .
so we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
i was given another gift , which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently .
that means we all share a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived around six million years ago .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , sir , have we met ? i don &apos;t remember meeting you . &quot;
so we have the remembering self and the experiencing self , and they &apos;re really quite distinct .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .
i mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle .
and i didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to california .
so you need at least as much time to learn a music musical language as you do for a spoken language .
so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors .
we &apos;re able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
and this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate .
and it &apos;s humbling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 150,000 &#93; years .
because it &apos;s in that nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are .
we made an application for layar , augmented reality , to find these aeds .
there is one corner , by the way , that i &apos;m not going to tell anybody about , where the wifi works .
well , we use that great euphemism , &quot; trial and error , &quot; which is exposed to be meaningless .
i &apos;m going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since launch .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
as peter tells us , not only do they produce the tallest structures , but they &apos;re the most interesting structures of them all .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil , he doesn &apos;t have a tape recorder .
we hope that this means no more pop-ups and other kind of rubbish like that -- shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
so , this man &apos;s grandfather was not intimidated by the arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced -- or 75 bricks for every person on the planet .
and to win , it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of board-certified doctors .
the founding fathers were , for my point of view , the original anatomical activists , and this is why .
they played one dice game , and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are triumphs of the scientific method .
it would have been , even without the environmental constraint , but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater .
i might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday -- that seemed pretty darn unlikely .
we you wouldn &apos;t be able to answer that spontaneously , but the following would happen and is happening at this very moment .
well , just to close , i want to suggest to you that i &apos;ve been talking a lot about the fathers .
who knows , maybe by the time your film comes out , we look like a bunch of blithering idiots .
what are we to make of the fact that we differ from them only really by a few nucleotides ?
it senses what i want to do , where i want to go , and then augments my strength and endurance .
but if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them , &quot; we &apos;ve run out of oil .
because if we could figure that out , we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands .
and it &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it &apos;s just a numbers game .
in the rich world , diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist , hardly .
here we have a very basic service : do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework ?
the greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity &quot; daemons . &quot;
and i also think it &apos;s dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to see it perpetuated into the next century .
so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the microsecond time scale .
so in other words , the future has kind of been shrinking one year per year for my whole lifetime .
they &apos;re more likely to delay choosing -- procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest .
so doing things like this -- you know , remind people about ban -- is kind of why were interested in it .
if you are surrounding yourself with the right people , they will not only get it , they will appreciate it .
i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model .
one method that &apos;s particularly interesting that i &apos;ve been using a lot lately is evolution itself .
we had a team of fellows in boston last year through the code for america program .
so imagine if you &apos;re in multiple places at the same time , what would that be like ?
obviously , with a virus it &apos;s pretty simple ; it &apos;s much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
so neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up .
so we were able to associate the small digital warhead with the rotor control .
echinacea , a little antioxidant to get you going .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about is one where you &apos;re deceiving yourself .
when professors become curious , they are often shoved into a research semester .
then the machine age happened and the book and then we had photolithography .
and it deals with problem-solving in a playful , creative , original way .
and we think we &apos;ll have the first fourth-generation fuels in about 18 months .
turns out it really means , &quot; we want nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
at that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
that &apos;s like saying , protect your child , hit it three times instead of five .
and the main lesson i think that we have learned is they are really different .
there &apos;s only the second best option , which is the fire brigade .
their desire to write the piece increasingly becomes my own desire to play the piece .
that sounds very spacey and like science fiction , i know .
so those tended to live longer , get expressed more .
we know that something else is really true .
i &apos;m talking about the soul .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , &quot; well , we could do a , or we could do b .
i would like to explain this mechanism to you today and make it a little more accessible to you , though you &apos;re probably quite familiar with it on an unconscious level .
so now i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; the harvesters &quot; by pieter bruegel at the met .
but here &apos;s the thing : when you get proof , you need to accept the proof , and we &apos;re not that good at doing that .
in offenbach , for example , twenty percent of the amount of waste produced by households consists of nappies .
but every once in a while , very rarely , something would happen , and one of these performers would actually become transcendent .
my heart beat fast , my head was dizzy , trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me .
the human part of this branch , way out on one end , is , of course , the one that we are most interested in .
you &apos;ll immediately hear the following from someone who thinks it &apos;s a matter of course that there are predictors , you can &apos;t prove that .
it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has .
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology .
and because you are possessed , you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be harmed ?
to these non-engineers , littlebits became another material , electronics became just another material .
so what could three billion rising , healthy , educated , productive members of humanity bring to us ?
another thing that &apos;s actually really important to me is creating content that is indian and yet very contemporary .
and every time it divided , they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them .
so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
so i wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
yet , my interest in photography started as i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
the rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge , that black object that you see .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you &apos;ve seen in those documentaries .
i &apos;ve spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in .
but not only that -- it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world &apos;s most urgent problems .
there are controversial topics such as all those genetically modified plants in the fields .
if anyone had built , say , a one inch structure , they would have taken home the prize .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , at walt disney concert hall .
and yes , the discussion always revolves around how much of the future you can anticipate .
every year we lose about three tonnes of phosphorus , which should really be circulated .
the result of which is that everywhere i go now , people treat me like i &apos;m doomed .
you can go and create your own museum online -- create your own collection across all these images .
so in all , we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is .
and you know , an epiphany is usually something you find that you dropped someplace .
so the idea that we can actually involve people in doing this thing together , collectively .
back in new york , i am the head of development for a non-profit called robin hood .
it is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life .
and you can go backwards , you can go forwards ; you cannot stay where you are .
they lie , they cheat , they get distracted and they produce really lame structures .
because the soil will the moss dies and the the wind and water wash away the soil .
so as a citizen you are put in a position where you can look into these scientific technologies .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a short explanation of what we &apos;re about to see .
and this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology .
well , since the film premiered at the sundance film festival , let &apos;s take a look .
while anytime i do an interview with someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves .
so in this project , we actually developed some small tags to track trash as it moves through the system .
our language hasn &apos;t caught up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
but danny , the whole american endeavor is about life , liberty , the pursuit of happiness .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs right now .
about a decade ago , i wrote a story about vaccines for the new yorker . a little story .
so the capacity to play in prototype is really essential , but let &apos;s look at how different teams perform .
and , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly .
there are very , very few things that they can even say there &apos;s a chance in a million of those things .
but , it struck me how much this dive , these deep dives , was like a space mission .
that &apos;s been the motivation , it &apos;s been the justification : it &apos;s been the business plan of american agriculture .
when i turn up in my little vw clunker and park next to it , i get this feeling .
there is an old african proverb that says , &quot; if you want to go quickly , go alone .
we designed the pieces , went through our error correction and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
if they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
they &apos;re living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted .
well i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
i tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes , these real-time control systems .
and you &apos;re going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part .
when a spirit has those qualities , we are able to create new realities and new ways of being .
maybe that &apos;s what adversity gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
the challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right prototype .
if you have 10 teams that typically perform , you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
and there &apos;s certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
if we can do that , then instead of being trapped in data , we might actually extract information .
so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one wikipedia page .
in holland it &apos;s easier to understand this , because holland built the country on flowers .
and that &apos;s why it is so strongly rooted in us , this ability to deal with virtuality .
and it contains seeds of rare plants , so that when you throw it away you &apos;re contributing to biodiversity .
the electronics industry only had a dozen or so components , and look at the diversity that came out of that .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
and the first thing i do is i ask the employees , &quot; tell me how these choices are different from one another .
of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from guatemala sent octavio a link to the tedtalk .
i need to go talk to the man on the street , the people who are like me , the regular joes .
and he came up home from a run one day and said , &quot; dad , my legs are tingling . &quot;
through my work i &apos;m trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected .
the following day , again everybody went to the center to meet the winning team and the prime minister at the time .
and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they &apos;re not equipped to adapt .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
here you have to keep another philosophical theme , a philosophical slow-burner , close to hand .
there &apos;s also an extra association , the cradle-to-cradle-institute , where everybody can get involved .
going back to my actual topic natural user interface and the topic that &apos;s behind that is usability of course .
and so they wrote down all these observations , and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics .
so here i &apos;m -- this is a fibonacci sequence that i &apos;m making with a simple equation program .
the next slide i show you will be a rapid fast-forward of what &apos;s happened over the last 25 years .
so if you want it to be better , then you &apos;ve got to show up and do your part of the deal .
it lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at boiling-water temperatures .
you know , we don &apos;t know necessarily what it &apos;ll look like : we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
i am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space , move around , find a new aqueous environment .
his uncle fled with his holiness in the diaspora that took the people to nepal .
they can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the mao .
now , a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules .
i &apos;m sorry about that , but i strive to learn one thing that i can pass on to other people .
never ever , ever make a mistake , but you worry about the details , about how that &apos;s going to happen .
right now in alabama 34 percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote .
in fact the recipe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
so we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters .
the more choices available , the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accounts .
&quot; i know , dude , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships : it &apos;s amazing .
and this one i really won &apos;t spend any time on , except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well .
in rwanda , even after the genocide , there was this commitment , but in this country we haven &apos;t done that .
and so what i &apos;m trying to ask , what i &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ?
we &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
i &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and i &apos;m really going to get to the cracks .
for those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this -- but i &apos;m going to click this off right now .
that i can suddenly that the appearance is becoming increasingly irrelevant for success , and usability is becoming an application .
and i was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another , and their edges didn &apos;t fit .
so as some of you may or may not have heard , a couple weeks ago , i took out an ad on ebay .
because it &apos;s a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn &apos;t able to communicate it . &quot;
but he says that this makes perfect sense , because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life .
and also there is this epic story , this inspiring story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing .
in fact it &apos;s held so tightly in place that i can shake it , and the knife does not come off .
and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada , 600 miles from the nearest ocean .
now , i don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
sure , i will have thrown some colors away too , but i will have added new ones to take their place .
perhaps you could just briefly stand up , so people can talk to you about the project during the break if they want to .
if you want to know how sea level rises from land-base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
like here , we have mr. dimitry golubov from the city of kiev in ukraine .
and the lagoon was surrounded by palm trees , as you can see , and a few mangrove .
and imagine if you would a.i. &apos; s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cellphone .
so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
but the problem was , you see , my idea had one fatal flaw , and that flaw was this .
but the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we retain them and do they have meaning .
i hear this guy , his voice behind me say , &quot; well , if it isn &apos;t aimee mullins . &quot;
adversity isn &apos;t an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life .
his work is brilliant . he looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds .
but not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game . right ?
we can move it where we want to move it , and we &apos;re going to move it where we want to move it .

i said , &quot; no , no , no . that &apos;s okay . you all go ahead . i &apos;m not going to have any beer . &quot;
so back in the day , when us indians wanted to travel we &apos;d jump into a chariot and we &apos;d zoom across the sky .
now in order to do that i &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
i find the last two words under &quot; near antonyms , &quot; particularly unsettling : &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; wholesome . &quot;
so , finally , the last game , we &apos;re launching it march 3rd . this is a game done with the world bank institute .
now , that &apos;s not going to get you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than counting stamens .
and it showed that , in fact , today , the human pattern recognition machinery is better at folding proteins than the best computers .
in fact , one of the things that i did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code .
jimmy kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become .
so , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california , you are not going to get to the correct answer .

and then there &apos;s do-it-yourself-bio- dot-org , diy bio .
here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed .
because you can see that i am putting everything i have into this , i don &apos;t have any more than this .

the monarchs of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept of dna , but they did have a concept of birthright .
what this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
the al gore book , &quot; our choice &quot; and the david mckay book , &quot; sustainable energy without the hot air . &quot;
that means that at that moment you have to see to it that the renewable energies can take over the entire network .
because you project an assumption that you &apos;re seeing something you recognise to the front , such as a circle .
it just completely warps and distorts egos , and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance .

i should just put it bluntly , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now -- it &apos;s exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
here &apos;s an example of it : there &apos;s an organism called deinococcus radiodurans that can take three millions rads of radiation .
one day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of mao , and for that transgression , she was given seven years of hard labor .

and they will contest this because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence presented .
this mountain of debris is actually collected by fishers every time they go into an area that &apos;s never been fished .
now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present , even then , it has negative consequences .
in those plans that offered nearly 60 funds , participation rates have now dropped to about the 60th percentile .
of the people who stopped when there were six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a jar of jam .
so the idea is , beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life , but actually get them to finance the film ?
and i phoned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expertise with what we found in code and data .
but this is also very bizarre , because of the story i told you at the beginning about androgen insensitivity syndrome .
when you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science , you end up in a place you don &apos;t want to be .
well , he goes on to tell me it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are eating what they &apos;d be eating in the wild .
direct advertising , and not necessarily for the company puma , but to help this company make these products successful .

and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
and i spent 30 days eating nothing but this -- fun in the beginning , little difficult in the middle , very dangerous in the end .
obviously it &apos;s clinging there , not by animal magnetism , but by chicanery , my index finger being there .
we &apos;ve lost faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason we shouldn &apos;t have .
i could also mention termites , but in the usa nobody likes termites , although they &apos;re vegetarians .

there was a scholar called jean buridan , and buridan &apos;s ass was named after him .
here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this unimaginable problem for us chefs : how do we keep fish on our menus ?
so , you know , it &apos;s got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
their brain waves were then measured , and depending on what they thought about or how they thought , different lights in the roomwent switched on .
legendary -- as in ted williams legendary -- the last major league baseball player to hit over 400 during a regular season .
but now those drops of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals .
and so when people make decisions , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they feel disappointed about them ; they blame themselves .
and the more options there are to consider , the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs .
by not participating , they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the employer , who would happily match their contribution .
and more than anything , for those of you who share that , i &apos;ve simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize , hold on .
now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these drops learned a trick about abstraction .
first it starts with the sexual organs , then it starts with cuss words , then it was bush slanders and then people actually got to art .
but because this individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t react to the testosterone .
why not have the quick wit of a ken jennings , especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the watson machine ?
you know , of course , this is my raggedy old thesaurus so i &apos;m thinking this must be an ancient print date , right ?
i won &apos;t go into detail . it &apos;s no longer painful these days , but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s .
who &apos;s going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
and the biggest question i get asked nowadays is , &quot; did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot;
today we can make things in such a way that when they show wear and tear , when they break , they can go into biological life cycles .
they are geared more towards the technical as well as the business aspects of it , and so you see more , well , practical questions being asked .
that &apos;s a network from the usa , that &apos;s more of a kind of a forum , where you where people can meet and discuss things online .
i think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we &apos;re overreaching , is the value of things like the lhc .
they call themselves the &quot; elder brothers &quot; and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for destroying the world .
in the 1980s in the communist eastern germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are marked , of course , by a challenge , whether physically , emotionally or both .
that poses the question as to what is actually the most intuitive performance scheme that we humans have and now i &apos;ve already given it away .
dan gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to .
so to make this blink faster or slower , you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower .
instead of having to program , to wire , to solder , littlebits allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures .
and maybe i &apos;ve been around long enough that i can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to do that .
but then the technology of electrolysis came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with throw-away mentality .
i grew up in the country in the rural south , and i have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger .
so right now , what i do is i design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .

only if you come with a different example , so as soon as you make one haystack bigger than the other , then he doesn &apos;t need any sense or anything else .
you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happily they &apos;re living their life , and vice versa .
these breakthroughs , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , pilot projects , regulatory things that have been changed .
anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use , to be able to contribute .
in the description of my presentation , it is written that i , as an interpreter , see myself as a translator , in the english sense of the word .
and the way we see things , what we pay attention to and how we guard ourselves against our environment so to speak , so that we can consider it accordingly .
our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing , and our latest point would put it on , now , an exponential curve .
then she said , &quot; the second thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . &quot;
you can actually see from underneath , sharing the main moments for the olympics in 2012 and beyond , and really using it as a way to connect with the community .
and that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some agriculture , hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry , cement .
this is the leftover , the 99 percent , where they &apos;ve taken out the part they burn now , so it &apos;s called depleted uranium .
and that &apos;s on a higher grail of user friendliness than the transferal of a classic metaphor , which is the one of the desktop .
and of those 6,000 languages , as we sit here today in monterey , fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children .
and i claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .

you can annotate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these masterpieces .
so for example , in a power plant , when your big steam turbine gets too over speed , you must open relief valves within a millisecond .
the funny thing was , we had to break into the parking lot too , so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too .
one day , los angeles times columnist steve lopez was walking along the streets of downtown los angeles when he heard beautiful music .
because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics , then shouldn &apos;t everything just follow quantum mechanics ?
they cut out the middleman , they cut out their agencies and said , &quot; maybe these agencies don &apos;t have my best interest in mind .
it &apos;s completely non-invasive , sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back .
since then , in the intervening 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours underwater , and 500 hours of that was in submersibles .
and yes , a lot of what is said today really moves me , because many , many nice statements were made , which i also was part of .
later i learned that at about this same time , javier and octavio were thinking about the challenge of reform in honduras .
and of course there are teams that have a lot more &quot; ta-da &quot; structures , and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten .
no , it simply looks a lot better when we show that we &apos;re responsible for removing the danger that others create when they set a fire .
it &apos;s necessary to have one &apos;s own experiences and idea of music to then make it resonate through a further possibility , which is an instrument .
the biggest single cause of global warming , along with deforestation , which is 20 percent of it , is the burning of fossil fuels .
and then we were looking for timers and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world -- to potential real world targets .
so that got our attention , and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with stuxnet and checked this thing out .
adaptive technology has since enabled me to learn how to downhill ski again , to rock climb and even handcycle .
here &apos;s why . this picture pretty much sums up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species . truly .
and then when i close my finger , same thing , as i move back , this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger .
because now you can implement a rule of three .
and i simply assume that we &apos;ll have the same capacity of electrochemical reservoirs in the whole world for the next thirty years .
i don &apos;t know whether this got the biggest cheer , or this , when someone went onto google and saw the front page was like that .
all the proteins changed , the membranes changed ; when we read the genetic code , it &apos;s exactly what we had transferred in .
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu ; we &apos;re always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine .
i needed somebody who could get inside my head , somebody who could really help me understand what they call your &quot; brand personality . &quot;
we found her one , we got her there , and we took care of her and watched over her family , because it was necessary .

and since you don &apos;t know me as the woman walking around ted in her underwear -- that means i found a few things .
when i &apos;m not fighting poverty , i &apos;m fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company .
now that &apos;s more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot .
my favorite is the middle one -- the mp3 player , nose hair trimmer , and creme brulee torch .
well , over the past decade , we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices .

we &apos;re a ways away from improving people : our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that . thank you very much .
and if that pans out , which i have every confidence it will , coca-cola will deploy this globally to 206 countries around the planet .
so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , that chunk of metal can be in two different places , then why not you ?
when i found the captain , he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner , who was surely having one of the worst days of her life .
when i look forward to the next decade , i know two things for sure : that we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play any games we want .
if i invite you over for dinner and i say : yes , we &apos;re having a pill with offenbach taste and a glass of water to go with it .
or if we go into the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a crude face of political domination .
we were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
but what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , accelerating the process .
when proctor &amp; amp ; gamble went from 26 different kinds of head &amp; amp ; shoulders to 15 , they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent .
i think that you &apos;re going to have a hard time meeting with them , but i think it &apos;s certainly worth pursuing a couple big , really obvious brands .
and he said , &quot; no , unless you &apos;re in the upper echelon and you &apos;ve got really amazing insurance , you can &apos;t actually do that .
i call it neo-evolution -- the new evolution that is not simply natural , but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make .
because , as a rule , we can reach our goal five times faster on average , for example , through this new type of usability , so natural user interfaces .
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .
we pay a lot of attention to new technologies , but it takes technologies and rules to get progress , and it &apos;s usually the rules that hold us back .
even though choosing gearshift doesn &apos;t tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor , it still prepares me for how to choose .
what i do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the united states being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy .
now , i &apos;m not saying this is the solution to all of humanity &apos;s problems -- since there &apos;s more to bonobo life than the kama sutra .
that way you can see that at no time can anything travel , as long as i &apos;m squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve .
so let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of co2 put out per each unit of energy .
because if you just read about it in secondary literature , that &apos;s not the same as when you &apos;ve done it yourself or have seen it being done .
the canadian government in april of 1999 gave back to total control of the inuit an area of land larger than california and texas put together .

the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you are of an iceberg that i photographed in qeqetarsuaq , greenland .
that will definitely be an energy carrier which will be hydrogen methane , power to gas you know alr , that &apos;s what it will be .
you can see that when we kind of do these sorts of views , where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi-resolution experience .
number one , how smooth it is -- through good time and bad time , war time and peace time , recession , depression and boom time .
because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time span of a single organism , instead of over this evolutionary time span .
and when we &apos;re faced with a body that actually presents us something quite different , it startles us in terms of those categorizations .
there &apos;s common , there &apos;s typical . there &apos;s no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , beige person if they existed ?
and i understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level .
it also gets me excited about this big product that i &apos;m putting together , so i &apos;m more willing to be motivated to be engaged .
and so i &apos;d feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics .
it &apos;s a place where women run the show , have sex to say hello , and play rules the day -- where fun is serious business .
they go , &quot; well , he &apos;s certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes .
and the machines that do that are rather expensive , the ones you buy commercially , they start at about four thousand euros at the least .
if we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing , it takes 142 pages just to print this genetic code .
it won &apos;t be very long before the reality will be the 1,000-dollar human genome , and it will be increasingly available for everyone .
this is a picture of a big , new city center that &apos;s being built in south korea -- bigger than downtown boston .
she &apos;s one of the organizers of this wonderful event and asked me to hold a presentation and present my idea .
the thread that links them all : our addiction to carbon based fuels , like dirty coal and foreign oil .
compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this tipping point .
imagine your your wife is sad , because you upset her , and you turn up with fifty roses .
and so , it seems to me , upon a lot of reflection , that the way that i have to work now , in order to continue writing , is that i have to create some sort of protective psychological construct , right ?
but to be fair , chemical engineers as a group haven &apos;t really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic-depressives .
and that &apos;s when ms. carr leaned forward , she put her finger in my face , she said , &quot; that &apos;s why you &apos;ve got to be brave , brave , brave . &quot;

and i remember , when i was about eight or nine years old , waking up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my cousins were running around .
so if you go back about two and a half billion years , the earth was this big , sterile hunk of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it .
not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients , family , relatives , &quot; what &apos;s up ?
what i want to do is make a film all about product placement , marketing and advertising , where the entire film is funded by product placement , marketing and advertising .

there is an experiencing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re-living the past , but basically it has only the present .
and that &apos;s , well that &apos;s these are usually really young people , but the only thing that that one that really unites everybody , is this fascination with technology .
eight years ago when i was at the media lab , i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
and their pupils would dilate , they would recoil , then they would look down and swallow hard and start to tell me their stories .
we &apos;re going through the same levels that multi-cellular organisms have gone through -- abstracting out our methods of recording , presenting , processing information .
that could be shoveling out a hydrant , pulling a weed , turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it .
i think we would all understand the sentiment that woody allen expressed when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to achieve immortality through my work .
of course , the curiosity , the science component of it -- it was everything . it was adventure , it was curiosity , it was imagination .
it has a megawatt output and can keep up that output for six hours and it &apos;s the battery that we came up with in the technical simulation .
they &apos;re able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their motion , and they have a screen and a wireless radio .
triplets of those letters code for roughly 20 amino acids , such that there &apos;s a single letter designation for each of the amino acids .
these might be courier services or cable guys for instance , just to see whether the aed that &apos;s submitted still is in place .
the process is feeding on itself and becoming , i guess , autocatalytic is the word for it -- when something reinforces its rate of change .

mary , meanwhile , cannot in all the states have the same right that henry has in all the states , namely , the right to marry .
in fact , you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction .

so he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like , &quot; i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and then i &apos;m going to be haunted by this song forever .
he had xx chromosomes , and in the womb , his adrenal glands were in such high gear that it created , essentially , a masculine hormonal environment .
so what this means , this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or shouldn &apos;t be working .
and for me , the best contemporary example that i have of how to do that is the musician tom waits , who i got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment .
the first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868 with a very simple idea : modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together .
and an hour or two later , if i saw her , she &apos;d come over to me and she &apos;d say , &quot; bryan , do you still feel me hugging you ? &quot;
you probably see the sense of urgency , a little bit of fear , but intense concentration , deep , deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem .
now the reason why this is important is because , by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way , i can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way .
when you then move all your fingers at the right time and in the way the way it is written in the notes , then tones come out , which , together , sound like music .
but then he got older , he got calmer , and one day he was driving down the freeway in los angeles he told me , and this is when it all changed for him .
the data came back from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and it was all the same : no correlation , no connection , none at all .
over here we simulate the entire transmission guidance system , the cable &apos;s kilometer physics , to illustrate the vibration behavior , so to speak , in the network .
and if , as an informed citizen , you wish to make useful choices in society and want to take part in the discussion , you need access to the knowledge and the technology .
so i was trying to persuade the hondurans , if you build a new city , you &apos;ve got to start with a site that &apos;s at least 1,000 square kilometers .
and as a consequence , his genitals were masculinzed , his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones .
they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life ; they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life .
now , if i want to just kind of take a peek at these , i might think , &quot; well , what about taking a look at all of cycling ? &quot;
i was riding in a 747 with marvin minsky once , and he pulls out this card and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
so the things that make a photograph look realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read it and then i want you to clap your hands if you &apos;re ready to take gary up on his offer .
over the course of this film , we had 500-plus companies who were up and down companies saying , &quot; no , &quot; they didn &apos;t want any part of this project .
but not only are we going to have the brand x title sponsor , but we &apos;re going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film .
this whole outfit , including the jacket , cost me $ 55 , and it was the most expensive thing that i wore the entire week .
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but i always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
and he drew again for the first time , in front of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was .
the same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves , but induce immunity against other viruses .
this is not like human insulin ; this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas .
and so my mother &apos;s prenatal physician had gone on vacation , so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &apos;ve beaten us badly .
okay , so let &apos;s review : a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators .
so brilliant -- there it is , right there , that distance that i &apos;m talking about -- that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work .
he says we should judge people &quot; based not on the color of their skin , but on the content of their character , &quot; moving beyond anatomy .
now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that gallup survey .
now you &apos;ll be asking yourself why all these designers are starting to concern themselves with such natural , archaic prototypes of communication , interaction , etc .
that &apos;s rather sad for the hacker community , because it doesn &apos;t at all fully describe what they actually how it actually all started and what &apos;s behind it .
so , as you can see , my passion is for making new human-computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work .
and it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
this is about the copying of genes , replicating genes , dna , fragments , so that you can make them visible .
play increases creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
this isn &apos;t about rice krispies , this is about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that meant .
so it &apos;s not enough to just be able to read notes and find the according keys on the piano or the right position on a violin string .
and this this ability to virtualise the virtual reality was something that people in pre-industrial times bitterly needed , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
it &apos;s not that simple , but it &apos;s also not impossible , and if you &apos;re curious enough and put enough energy into it , you can go far .
because with 50 funds to choose from , it &apos;s so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you &apos;ll just put it off until tomorrow .
it mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
they had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those that were in a locked case that came from thousand-year-old olive trees .
we don &apos;t believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data , and i do understand that , i think we all do .
no , i actually fell out of love with this fish because , i swear to god , after that conversation , the fish tasted like chicken .
and of course we hope that we &apos;ll expand in a similar way and also be similarly networked , so that more people can get involved .
it &apos;s really like an easy street for bacteria , with the occasional interruption of the unintended forced rush to the exit .
once you &apos;ve selected a piece to play , because you love it , you first look into the background of the composition &apos;s creation .
and what happened is that we transferred the responsibility for our memories and the the production of our individual memories to external media .
what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke ?
and on a cloudy day , there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and i wondered , maybe i could feel better again .
it &apos;s been proven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what i &apos;m wearing , and we &apos;ve had great conversations .
they were simply told , &quot; these are the &apos; a-students , &apos; these are the &apos; d-students . &apos; &quot; and that &apos;s how they went about teaching them and treating them .
a terrorist place , but it was was called wuseltronik and it made wind and solar power and that &apos;s where i started out in the mid-eighties .
depending on how and when i carve , a very different kind of coverage comes into being compared to when someone expresses it in a lively form , so to speak .
and as you can see , this is an area that is full of islands and so the people had to somehow navigate through there , from island to island , to find food .
he was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn &apos;t bear to be without him .
now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . take this plant here .
think about it , that a masai warrior on a cellphone in the middle of kenya has better mobile comm than president reagan did 25 years ago .
in a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute , only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have .
now some time ago , if you wanted to win a formula 1 race , you take a budget , and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car .
today , you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 dollars and in the space of about a week .
i came to realize , as a physician , that i was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution -- not necessarily contradictory , just different .
and you know what ? when i say this stuff , people scream at me , and they say , &quot; what do you care ? let people do what they want to do .
because as i said in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology and most people know relatively little about it and also have no chance of educating themselves really well on it .
and even if the answer to the question is &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to make the experience of your kid &apos;s soccer game very different than it would &apos;ve been .
they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; linguistic exogamy : &quot; you must marry someone who speaks a different language .
unlike the settled middle-class suburbs , whose existence i was oblivious of , there was no sense of entitlement in footscray .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all-expenses-paid free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world .
so that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clock , because i thought , &quot; well , we don &apos;t know what the target is .
some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end , while others can &apos;t take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion .
the problem is , of course , that , as we begin to look at all that commonality , we have to begin to question why we maintain certain divisions .
believe it or not , there &apos;s an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant .
we &apos;ve got a graphic novel , we &apos;ve got leveling up in skills like local insight , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and resourcefulness .
so if we look at the development of our society , summarised briefly here , we are moving from the third to the fourth social generation , or social form .
and in fact , i know , i &apos;m very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves ? &quot;
in the other , i was enmeshed in lives that were precarious , tragically scarred by violence , drug abuse and isolation .
it &apos;s when we warmed it up , and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box , we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece .
the founding fathers rejected that idea , and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept , and that concept was all men are created equal .
there &apos;s a scholar there , his name is wolf singer , and sometimes people say , wolf singer claims , there is no free will .
that means the local village has turned into a global village with the same principles : as natural as possible , as intuitive as possible , but also with complete transparency .
the reason i felt worse is that , with all of these options available , my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up .
i sent out some facebook messages , some twitter messages , and i gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my 2011 ted talk .
and , perhaps , if we see adversity as natural , consistent and useful , we &apos;re less burdened by the presence of it .
i say i &apos;m going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve , that is a lie .
because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time , sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
and now you can simply , if you want to test something for yourself and especially if you want to make people happy , practice this courage to lie .
do you remember when carl sagan turned the voyager spacecraft back towards the earth , in 1990 after it just passed saturn ?
and then my friends who make small independent films say , &quot; well , how are we supposed to compete with these big , giant hollywood movies ? &quot;
what they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years .
and a pleasure too , if you look at how people in italy throw out a can of coca-cola from their car window .
one country has already volunteered to let its supreme court be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there .
and i was amazed to find opposition : opposition to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
i spend most of my time in very low-income communities in the projects and places where there &apos;s a great deal of hopelessness .
and not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advised their clients not to take part .
they leveled that playing field and decided the anatomy that mattered was the commonality of anatomy , not the difference in anatomy , and that was a really radical thing to do .
and in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity ?
and so we knew , if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically , we &apos;re going to have to kick out all the other passengers .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the most honourable thing for us would be to not be here at all , right ?
we &apos;ve been digitizing it now for almost 20 years ; when we sequenced the human genome , it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you .
so i went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones , and i said , you know , &quot; i want a pair of jeans . here &apos;s my size . &quot;
in order to make sense out of sensation , of course , i had to understand something about this remarkable faith of vodoun . and voodoo is not a black magic cult .
and because nothing is more important to us than survival , the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala .
what &apos;s incredible for me is the projects that i &apos;ve gotten the most feedback out of , or i &apos;ve had the most success in , are ones where i &apos;ve interacted with things directly .
now i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time imagining the conception , because if you spend all that time imagining that conception , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
there &apos;s an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i &apos;m disabled .
and the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the analog processes of optical printers and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
and you don &apos;t have -- as an attacker -- you don &apos;t have to deliver this payload by a usb stick , as we saw it in the case of stuxnet .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self ; time has very little impact on the story .
and she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .
and people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars .
so in one case : all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down .
when i think about creating abundance , it &apos;s not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibility .
but recently , dna evidence has shown that the etruscans , who then led to the roman empire , actually share the same dna as the ancient lydians .
how to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think , and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self .
so , if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a log -- put it down and not have those same complexities .
we will switch it on , and we expect to take data in june or july , and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
we want to encourage a world of creators , of inventors , of contributors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
so literally , imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors , 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the health care workers .
so i one day decided to pay a visit to the manager , and i asked the manager , &quot; is this model of offering people all this choice really working ? &quot;
the leader of the congress came up on stage and said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your lecture , but maybe we could watch the tedtalk .
we have to have these conversations and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we &apos;re going to be happy we do .
so , here i was again with a small team , in uncharted territory , doing &quot; avatar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
and that was then it &apos;s not binding , but it &apos;s yes , i think it has managed to become accepted quite well , people are quite convinced about it , yes .
i mean , it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time , but you weren &apos;t born with this notion , you developed it .
and sometimes , a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment to a &quot; ta-da &quot; moment .
and the envelope pushed back , and i was told by the folks at my company that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
i was seventeen when i took part in a course of his and played the last of chopin &apos;s four ballads , one of his later works .
if your work was brilliant you couldn &apos;t take all the credit for it , everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you .
for every nine people who have been executed , we &apos;ve actually identified one innocent person who &apos;s been exonerated and released from death row .
so an organism could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it .
i personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
there , the focus is on how to approach people in interactive media , so that they can use interactive media and can come to the most satisfying result possible .
and finally , this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me , almost at counsel table .
it says , &apos; this plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . &apos; doesn &apos;t that make you feel confident ? &quot;
so one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; opossum in my trashcan . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me , she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands .
we &apos;ll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years , and we can compress it down to a thousand years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years .
so there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst are recent graduates of business school .
that means we first project what we see before we actually see it , then we bring that to the back into our seeing machine , and then we say , okay ,
its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
but they also hold a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooperation .
and many discussions i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion i had in the last thirty years regarding photovoltaics .
a whipped cream dispenser , when you fill it up with water , it has enough pressure , i think about forty to sixty bar .
and an interesting thing happened : the jacques cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth .
and our european energy grid basically consists of rotating masses of large power plants , where the axle always revolves around the whole of europe .
a process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here --- knows does not always behave rationally .
and every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect positively the lives of a billion people within a decade .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long , but it bends toward justice .
and finally , saturday : developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
they counted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
i think that molecular biology in general , so generally speaking biotechnology , everything that can be included in that , like synthetic biology , etc .
what about giving the oppressed , wherever they might be , the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever ?
i love finding , wearing , and more recently , photographing and blogging a different , colorful , crazy outfit for every single occasion .
i told my wife , whenever a person uses the word because to morally justify something , we should try to replace it with the word although .
and it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more .
so , our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity , but preparing them to meet it well .
but we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
here you have this little mechanism .
well in egypt , the rioters looted the headquarters of the egyptian secret police in april 2011 , and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of programming , carb-fest and all-night sessions , tony drew again for the first time in seven years .
so , the thing that &apos;s been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours , and you &apos;re reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you &apos;re going through this process .
we &apos;re actually starting at a new point : we &apos;ve been digitizing biology , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life .
but here &apos;s the thing that keeps me up at night -- one of the things that keeps me up at night : we &apos;ve never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . never .
according to burrelles , the movie premiered in january , and since then -- and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing -- we &apos;ve had 900 million media impressions for this film .
yes , this is a huge debate at the moment , additional construction of coal-burning power plants , because otherwise we wouldn &apos;t have , or gas turbines , because that &apos;s not possible .
a lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls .
and i &apos;d like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total b.s .
but these apps are like little digital reminders that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government , putting in our taxes and getting back services .
so when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i used to go to this very , very upscale grocery store ; at least at that time it was truly upscale .
in a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis , the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was 124 to one .
it may seem like we &apos;re quite remote from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , for the most part , the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same .
but the logic of deception allows us to act as if the first theorem were false from the start , so of course you &apos;d have accept the opposite without any proof .
it always makes for a happy concert when i have the fortune to experience the piece anew , even though i &apos;ve been working on it for so long in advance .
it was fascinating because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation and said , &quot; well you know it &apos;s deeply troubling to hear what you &apos;re talking about . &quot;
now there &apos;s playful brands and mindful brands , those things that have come and gone , but a playful , mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing .
and if you have heard that the dropper of stuxnet is complex and high-tech , let me tell you this : the payload is rocket science .
if i tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self .
well , i got on the phone with a few people in the company ; no one could give me a straight answer until finally , i got on the phone with the head biologist .
basically , in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each siftable , and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary .
now let &apos;s take this back into my world of medicine where i &apos;m a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what i &apos;m going to talk to you about .
but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
and what happens is when you think about living in california , you are thinking of the contrast between california and other places , and that contrast , say , is in climate .
you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away , and all you see are flooded canals and this thick , rich marshland .
we now , from our discovery around the world , have a database with about 20 million genes , and i like to think of these as the design components of the future .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet .
so an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally , that &apos;s sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government .
what that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; oh his father is six feet tall , &quot; how much would you know about his height ?
at this point and if you &apos;re laughing , you &apos;ll recognize how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience what artists are very good at telling us .
what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of germany was executing people , especially if they were disproportionately jewish ?
and because government ultimately derives its power from us -- remember &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens .
are you reliable , stable , familiar , safe , secure , sacred , contemplative or wise like the dalai lama or yoda ?
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman &apos;s repertoire .
and a lot of what i &apos;ve worked on is people who have atypical sex -- so people who don &apos;t have the standard male or the standard female body types .
you know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the author &apos;s description , put something on the movie screen in our heads .
and we got talking about music , and i got an email from steve a few days later saying that nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me .
at the media campus , for example , we are attempting to render virtual reality in our virtual reality laboratory , but we have actually always been capable of this .
and i said aloud , &quot; listen you , thing , you and i both know that if this book isn &apos;t brilliant that is not entirely my fault , right ?
because it makes as much sense as anything else i have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process .
so this is it . and for those of you that weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted -- 27 kilometers in circumference .
and i &apos;ve argued that we &apos;re about to perhaps create a new version of the cambrian explosion , where there &apos;s massive new speciation based on this digital design .
the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
and i made myself a bargain that if only i redouble my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again , please make the voices stop .
so those are just a few of the clips i collected over the last six months -- could have easily been the last six days or the last six years .
and getting this idea during winter , i knew that i had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
but it &apos;s also apt . because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games , we &apos;re actually changing what we are capable of as human beings .
i can make bach &apos;s tonal ideas sound on a modern grand piano in such a way that a baroque harpsichord was not able to .
translating from german into english can already demand more knowledge , especially if it if one has to if it &apos;s the translation of literature or even poetry .
bg : well , we need -- for one of these high-scale , electro-generation things that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy .
if you are a gamer , you will notice a few nuances here : the crinkle of the eyes up , and around the mouth is a sign of optimism , and the eyebrows up is surprise .
you need to imagine that in the following way , if you do something with classical software and take five hours to do it , then you &apos;d only need one hour to do the same thing with this new type of natural software .
i &apos;m a mule , and the way that i have to work is that i have to get up at the same time every day , and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly .
so , according to herodotus , they invented dice games and they set up a kingdom-wide policy : on one day , everybody would eat , and on the next day , everybody would play games .
so , the other grade is : are we deploying this zero-emission technology , have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we &apos;re in the process of getting it elsewhere ?
you know , i went and pitched it to the studio as &quot; &apos; romeo and juliet &apos; on a ship : &quot; it &apos;s going to be this epic romance , passionate film . &quot;
up till now the following is always argued in discussions , these islanders are becoming self-sufficient , they have their own little network , which has nothing to do with our joint network .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in berlin , where we could precisely reconstruct , so to speak , the electrical ratio of the island on a one to three scale .
this means that the interpreter must translate these imprecise indications in the language of notes into a different , which is to say an audible , concrete , non-verbal musical language .
intuitive usability didn &apos;t start to become an elementary economic factor , an elementary success factor , when apple appeared on the scene , if i wanted to make technological devices usable for people .
i had a lot of journalists calling me , asking me , &quot; which is the test they &apos;re going to run that will tell us whether or not caster semenya is male or female ? &quot;
well , the things i constantly hear are : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want giant fields of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .
but on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity to get more control of their health .
and , you know , i was already bargaining , as a five year-old child , with dr. p to try to get out of doing these exercises , unsuccessfully , of course .
bg : well , the actual spending on the r &amp; amp ; d piece -- say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it &apos;s not that dramatic .
and it &apos;s that playful curiosity that drives us to explore , drives us to interact , and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hotbed for creativity .
and i found that because there weren &apos;t video games and this saturation of cg movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape , i had to create these images in my head .
just like when people in the village used to know who is having an affair with whom and when , now it &apos;s happening with the extension of ourselves through mobile end devices on a global level .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i would do so and i would be able to take care of my attending &apos;s patients without even having to contact him .
so i got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane , but often there are obstructions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane .
and so i consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists , who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us something of a solution in his &quot; i have a dream &quot; speech .
jacques cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined .
and if we manage to do it , we &apos;ll of course manage to do it for adidas , for nike , for hennes and mauritz and the whole textile industry .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we &apos;re trying to create a process that &apos;s extremely robust that you can see in a minute .
unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century , this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spreading it or by doing something new with it .
my wife and kids and i moved to our back garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house .
we can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death , seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
ninety percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tunas , the halibuts , the salmons , swordfish -- they &apos;ve collapsed .
over the last hundred years , the average human lifespan has more than doubled , average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled .
one of the places we &apos;re seeing it , for example , in our culture today , in the united states today , is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life .
well , it &apos;s good , except that paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the whining .
the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory ; basically , it &apos;s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
you get in this capsule , you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can &apos;t get back by yourself .
so you &apos;re noticing a change is taking place , from a defensive attitude to to well , to the idea , one hundred percent renewable energies is right .
it got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material , chewed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromosome .
and these scientists simply documented all the various tasks that these ceos engaged in and how much time they spent engaging in making decisions related to these tasks .
people sort of think i went away between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and was buffing my nails someplace , sitting at the beach .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , however romantic , is also instructive .
my first memories are from the boat -- the steady beat of the engine , the bow dipping into each wave , the vast and empty horizon .
and if you manipulate the speed of this rotor , you are actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even have the centrifuge explode .
it &apos;s the experiencing self that the doctor approaches -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; does it hurt now when i touch you here ? &quot;
if we go ahead and we filter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about .
we should call it what it is : a business in liquidation , a business that &apos;s quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible .
we &apos;re looking to see if we can take captured co2 , which can easily be piped to sites , convert that co2 back into fuel to drive this process .
now when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , and they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
if people took seriously that finding , i mean , it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about , like for example , taxation policy and so forth .
because we &apos;d really have to prove whether the soul exists or not .
but we found ourselves lagging in the mid &apos; 90s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do .
it looks something like this , somebody who does not have free will cannot be held responsible responsible for his actions and claims and is thus of unsound mind .
i will have more life experience than today and so my musical palette will have many more nuances of color , of emotions and feelings than it does now .
they look at biological materials in an artistic way and , yes , also electronic tinkering , and combine this in a very outlandish way .
and i &apos;ve learned that that deep-ocean environment , and even the shallow oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
then the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of richness that comes out of that is really huge . it &apos;s a classic network effect .
i recently did a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that the typical american reports making is about 70 in a typical day .
a few weeks later , the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home .
one should eat the food that is lovingly cooked by a cook , not just look at it or pass on the recipe for it .
they should discuss this innovation agenda , and you &apos;d be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches .
and if you want to exceed twenty , thirty percent renewable energies , you have to switch off diesel .
and then we took apart a dvd burner and took out the burner the laser and then tried to focus on this camera .
so of course , random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
and they will they have been increasingly overwritten during the course of the centuries by the influences of the machine age .
and while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything .
in sending her home , i disregarded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me , &quot; goldman , not a good idea . don &apos;t do this . &quot;
what do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or an orthopedic surgeon , an obgyn , a paramedic is supposed to be ?
now , this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend .
and my love of science fiction actually seemed mirrored in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late &apos; 60s , we were going to the moon , we were exploring the deep oceans .
we &apos;re looking at many , many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in , panning through the thing , rearranging it in any way we want .
this tribe , the cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca , all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest , all of which are referable to our eye as one species .
and i was blown away , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible , to get as many people to see it as possible .
and in that bond , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a task that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .
and finally , in the end , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve traveled in these remote reaches of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
the fact that our system has an increase in price is due to the fact that we still use twenty percent diesel fuel and a control of the price increase doesn &apos;t break through to the other things .
we only have phosphorus for two years and phosphorus mining worldwide is already emitting a lot more uranium into the environment than the amount that is used in all nuclear plants .
we &apos;re actually projecting in another 10 years the level of disenfranchisement will be as high as it &apos;s been since prior to the passage of the voting rights act .
and there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way .
and as far as isolation goes , when we as a species do colonize distant planets , there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way .
i learned a lot about science . but i also learned a lot now you think director has got to be a leader , leader of , captain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
and with a very short period of time , all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
well i hope that you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource that we can use to do real-world work , that games are a powerful platform for change .
now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what i wanted . &quot;
those are two very different entities , the experiencing self and the remembering self , and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness .
when this device sequences an rna or dna virus that it doesn &apos;t recognize , it calls the cdc and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place .
now if you do the math , people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six than if they encountered 24 .
but it was a fairly abstract discussion , and at some point when there was a pause , octavio said , &quot; paul , maybe we could watch the tedtalk . &quot;
but for over two weeks , we programmed , we went to the venice boardwalk , my kids got involved , my dog got involved , and we created this .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient greek historian herodotus , you might know this history , which is the history of who invented games and why .
but i think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real , i &apos;m just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
and to my mind , the scientific method -- trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &apos;t -- is one of the great accomplishments of humanity .
a lot of arguments against it : fish farms pollute -- most of them do anyway -- and they &apos;re inefficient . take tuna , a major drawback .
and because they work so much harder physically than we do and only live for three to six months , their weight , their energy consumption amounts to that of thirty billion people .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and weed out all the error-prone health professionals , well there won &apos;t be anybody left .
and i think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that , over the past couple of decades , we went from the physical world to the digital one .
so sex is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just that intersex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum -- in some ways , they can be all over the place .
and by the way , we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place .
and of course the stories that i chose to tell were science fiction stories : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens &quot; and &quot; the abyss . &quot;
and in this scenario , i want to imagine that , in one case , the sperm is carrying a y chromosome , meeting that x chromosome of the egg .
from darwin &apos;s work , amongst others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation .
and then i went to berlin in the mid-eighties because i wanted to study renewable energies and they didn &apos;t have that in karlsruhe .
people believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source , for distant and unknowable reasons .
there &apos;s enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we can &apos;t buy them .
armstrong twittered about us , and then in december , time magazine honored us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010 , which was really cool .
and that was , for us , was very interesting , because , as architects , as engineers , as designers , we always think about how people will use the things we design .
they had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth .
i had somebody count the number of books with &quot; happiness &quot; in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
and the source was a man , an african-american man , charming , rugged , homeless , playing a violin that only had two strings .
and i went through the same period of shame and recriminations and felt cleansed and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
we have a hard time talking about race , and i believe it &apos;s because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation .
it &apos;s that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics .
urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle , combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success .
now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
suppose you have appendicitis and you &apos;re referred to a surgeon who &apos;s batting 400 on appendectomies .
that probably doesn &apos;t mean that you can go home four hours earlier , but that your employer or whoever will think of something else you can do with those four hours .
and there &apos;s nothing precedented in the history of technology development of this kind of self-feeding growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years .
and secondly , we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it .
the point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it . but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was seeing out that window .
i pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in buffalo , new york , right across the border from where we live .
it could be this peculiar , wondrous , bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between tom and the strange , external thing that was not quite tom .
and the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition , angry and inflexible , and troubled children caught between two worlds .
last month , i had the pleasure of announcing with qualcomm foundation something called the $ 10 million qualcomm tricorder x prize .
i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that really spins this category into the positive , versus &quot; fights odor and wetness . &quot;
i challenge you guys that are flying today , imagine the same thing happens on your plane -- and please don &apos;t -- but imagine , and how would you change ?
for the remembering self , a two-week vacation is barely better than the one-week vacation because there are no new memories added .
at that time , there were self-governing companies and one of them was in <<unk>> zberg in mehringhof , where people thought evil took place .
i have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .
and there were rare but searing chants of &quot; slit-eye &quot; and the occasional graffiti : &quot; asian , go home . &quot;
most of them are ordinary digital camera photos , but this one , for example , is a scan from the library of congress , and it &apos;s in the 300 megapixel range .
we have second- and third-generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar , to much higher-value fuels like octane or different types of butanol .
and the official dogma runs like this : if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens , the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom .
in fact , the drops that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemicals around them , grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more .
now in fact , you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around , but i would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around .
so when i knew i was coming here to do a ted talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship , i knew i would want to do something a little different .
to paraphrase : it &apos;s not the strongest of the species that survives , nor is it the most intelligent that survives ; it is the one that is most adaptable to change .
this applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness , and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as messed up as anybody else is .
at the moment we &apos;re growing corn and losing between eleven and thirty kilograms thirty tonnes per hectare , if you were to calculate it per square metre .
and all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the 20th century alone , of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands , you know ?
you know , and what is it specifically about creative ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other &apos;s mental health in a way that other careers kind of don &apos;t do , you know ?
now , of all the peoples that i &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the kogi of the sierra nevada de santa marta in northern colombia .
and the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology slides that we &apos;re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a semi-log curve .
and when they play with their particles , they find they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can fly right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
i get to meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually go to a good cause ; i look pretty unique ; and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt .
it &apos;s very different than saying &quot; we &apos;re a twelve-foot-high truck trying to get under a ten-foot bridge , and we can just sort of squeeze under . &quot;
and so i had to develop this new intuition , that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space .
the fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people , but it &apos;s also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room .
but tomorrow it can be , in order to tackle today &apos;s pressing challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how we can go from the digital world to the physical one .
so as i do this , i &apos;m also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that , believe it or not , i have picked up in these adventures wearing nothing new .
it demands that we bring all of our senses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
and we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today , that &apos;s sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors -- that &apos;s our fuel to begin with .
so given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s no wonder that we &apos;re pessimistic .
and we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e-health projects fail , since we stopped listening .
my duty was not to allow it to have been in vain , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to crush us , but we endured .
not anymore a building that would open up to let you in , but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water , and you had to jump without getting wet .
and they do some tests and figure out that , instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus , she actually has testes inside , and she has a y chromosome .
and it &apos;s often not until she hits puberty and she &apos;s growing and developing breasts , but she &apos;s not getting her period , that somebody figures out something &apos;s up here .
now in our town , where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff , you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action .
and most profoundly of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and to inherit the wisdom , that we &apos;ll need to make these choices wisely ?
the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive .
it &apos;s not just code for america fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps every day in their own communities .
so these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organism .
one , we battered down the doors of the insurance companies , and we actually got tempt a machine that let him communicate -- a stephen hawking machine .
and part of me also wonders , what if content of character turns out to be something that &apos;s scannable in the future -- able to be seen with an fmri ?
so , i suggest if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , i &apos;ll do the first bad part behind it .
and funnily enough it was developed at the bbc mannheim , called abb today , in the seventies , and was then licensed to the japanese .
what is particularly impressive in the area of interactive media is the fact that we &apos;ve anchored the ability to think in a non-linear way in our biological memory .
according to the author of the book the storytelling animal , jonathan gottschall , we still spend one thousand nine hundred hours a year on the reception of stories .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea , you don &apos;t pollute . &quot;
and that is kind of our vision of sensible energy use and i am grateful to the cradle to cradle institute that they said , use solar power .
and the wind power plant or the solar power plant or whatever it is is generally a back-up system , or a system that can only feed into the network in small quantities .
it means that when we can see that we can transfer existing performance models onto something else , for example the metaphor , then i can make use of that as a designer .
so these are really exciting processes , which take place accordingly in this , well , it &apos;s not really a grey area , but in this rose-tinted area .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the viral particles .
the payload goes onto the gray box , damages the centrifuge , and the iranian nuclear program is delayed -- mission accomplished .
i have a company that does design and animation , so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part of what we admire and respect in the art world .
we have to deal with the inexorable separation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
that &apos;s why we &apos;ve made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal .
given who we were and how life had shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have thwarted us .
now if we manage to compromise these systems that control drive speeds and valves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
now , having selected government , i can now see that the wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are time magazine people of the year .
but then the whole thing can be just a 3d cloud of pixels that you can approach and move through it and see from many , many directions .
and the friends of mine who make big , giant hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have .
we &apos;ll start by putting a lead into two sequence siftables , arrange them into a series , extend it , add a little more lead .
and the second aspect is that since we because of these archaic models , we are certainly able to talk in a very , very visual manner , although we use a codified language today .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of beer -- i don &apos;t know where he got it -- and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods .
and there are , fortunately now , dozens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- who , likewise , if their science goes well , if the funding for their pilot plants goes well , that they can compete for this .
potable water , arable land , rainforests , oil , gas : they &apos;re going away , and they &apos;re going away soon , and unless we innovate our way out of this mess , we &apos;re going away too .
think also , if it were possible ever for you to choose , not simply to choose the sex of your child , but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life evaluation , so we need to have that debate fairly soon .
and it &apos;s really clear , if you look at the history of the founding fathers , a lot of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a naturalistic world .
if we don &apos;t , if we continue to act the way we &apos;re acting , we &apos;re guilty of something that i don &apos;t think we want to be guilty of : high-tech colonialism .
about 12 years ago , there was a story published , a horrible story , that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine shot .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere , adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species .
a colleague of mine got access to investment records from vanguard , the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different workplaces .
and so , my fellow primates , let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together , as we rediscover creativity , fellowship and wonder .
so for those people who did choose to participate , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds .
that means , attention , now you know that , pay attention to how long you look at someone , because i will not be held responsible for what might happen .
so it &apos;s just like from the hollywood movies where during the heist , the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video .
we have all these amazing superpowers : blissful productivity , the ability to weave a tight social fabric , this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning .
another example is so-called virtual reality as crazy as that may of course sound in the context of my presentation , we are physically moving in non-existent , virtual worlds there , according to the example of the holodeck .
now , i know you &apos;re asking , &quot; how are we going to solve real world problems in games ? &quot; well , that &apos;s what i have devoted my work to over the past few years , at the institute for the future .
we can go to watch our kid play soccer , and we have our cell phone on one hip , and our blackberry on our other hip , and our laptop , presumably , on our laps .
only things that are subject to wear and tear , such as shoe soles , brake coverings , car tyres , they have to be made in such a way that they go back into biological systems .
do i understand this right ? that what your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically link together ?
i have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case ; that is , we go on vacations , to a very large extent , in the service of our remembering self .
and it was only when he had reached the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from menstruating internally , that doctors figured out that , in fact , he was female internally .
and 18 months ago , i had another job at google , and i pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
two years later i was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of toronto , and i saw a 25 year-old man with a sore throat .
and it &apos;s exceedingly likely that anything i write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book , right ?
so what i want to propose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues -- that you can easily apply in your businesses .
now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because i &apos;m a legal citizen .
and at the end of the day , i packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when i did something that i don &apos;t usually do .
and by giving it a gentle nudge , we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time -- something that &apos;s only allowed with quantum mechanics .
and the reasoning behind that would be , first , we have , through medicine , managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population .
so , we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they are learning about everything else in school .
like my dad , for example , was a chemical engineer and i don &apos;t recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer , you know ?
play &apos;s a shapeshifter , and it can take many forms , some of which are more quiet , imaginative , curious -- maybe where wonder is discovered anew .
this is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in berkeley , california , where i did my phd on why we &apos;re better in games than we are in real life .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy , that you &apos;ll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you .
and we &apos;re just trying to demonstrate that we can decrease the capacities , the must-run capacities , by putting electrochemical reservoirs in the network too .
how big would a battery like that actually have to be to get to twenty , thirty , forty , fifty , maybe even seventy percent renewable energies .
but i bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson , and that &apos;s that large things don &apos;t let you get right past them , and that they stay in one place .

we can see that here , when i design things , then i can design them in a confusing way , as you can see here on the right , where i can &apos;t tell which one is salt and which one is pepper , or i can basically design them intuitively , by showing things .
it turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill , that &apos;s like aspirin shaped -- it &apos;s just a round white pill -- it has some certain measurable effect .
the coal revolution fueled the industrial revolution , and , even in the 1900s we &apos;ve seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air-conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
we turned off the lights , and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air , and then we cooled it down now , all alone in the elevator , the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted .
but since it didn &apos;t happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like jenny mccarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like &quot; oprah &quot; and &quot; larry king live . &quot;
now , together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet , and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere .
take , for example , this child of a barasana in the northwest amazon , the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin , and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because bacteria communicate .
and i want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist , and that is that i think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies , particularly when we have people thinking in groups .
let me now introduce you to elegs that is worn by amanda boxtel that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured , and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now .
something interesting came out of &quot; the abyss , &quot; which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film , which was to create this kind of liquid water creature , we actually embraced computer generated animation , cg .
and dr. kean went on to tell me , he said , &quot; in my experience , unless repeatedly told otherwise , and even if given a modicum of support , if left to their own devices , a child will achieve . &quot;
when we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pairs , they won &apos;t any longer grow readily in e. coli -- it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology -- and so we turned to other mechanisms .
and i realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outsider , a recent arrival , new on the scene -- and not just okay , but something to be thankful for , perhaps a gift from the boat .
and so i can have a very different view of the city , a very different impression , because i see negative and positive zones of a city and , in this way , have a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
but that &apos;s the nicest thing that could happen , since this is peer pressure , peer pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for obesity , it could be used to stop smoking in patients .
and as i said earlier , i put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could ready me , for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys .
and this is really incredible , because people actually believe that this advanced technology which you come into contact with there , that it transports you into the future , but in fact the future is in us , in our archaic roots .
and , because i was born without the fibula bones , and had feet turned in , and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that , he had to be the bearer -- this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news .
but it would be worse , except for that i happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when i first started telling people -- when i was a teenager -- that i wanted to be a writer , i was met with this same kind of , sort of fear-based reaction .
and when we &apos;re in game worlds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves , the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s notice , the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again .
and now i &apos;ll hold up one of these little devices , because things are supposed to become increasingly intuitive , increasingly natural , more user friendly , and then you have to look at what we humans consider natural , what we consider user friendly or intuitive .
aren &apos;t you afraid that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing &apos;s ever going to come of it and you &apos;re going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure ? &quot;
and if i then place a half oval next to it , we suddenly no longer just see a unit , which is the circle , the circle and , yes , we see a unit , and no longer three parts , one circle , one circle , another .
they picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil , so they speared the five missionaries to death .
i always keep my thesaurus handy whenever i &apos;m writing anything , but i &apos;d already finished editing the piece , and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word &quot; disabled &quot; to see what i &apos;d find .
imagination is more important than knowledge , and i &apos;d like to close on that sentence a and again give the advice that designers must also think differently to arrive at new solutions , and so i thank you warmly for your attention and please .
and i definitely know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption , particularly given the circumstance that i &apos;m in right now in my career .
and this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said , &quot; i came into this courtroom to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the prize , hold on . &quot;
now , the problem with collaborative online environments like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds .
later that day , i was driving around this property with miguel , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems so natural , unlike like any farm i &apos;d ever been at , how do you measure success ? &quot;
last year i showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states , has shrunk by 40 percent .
in urban communities across this country -- los angeles , philadelphia , baltimore , washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in jail or prison or on probation or parole .
immediately after that vote , on february 21st to the 24th , a delegation of about 30 hondurans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business .
so , the last example i have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we &apos;ve built recently , in which siftables act as sounds like lead , bass and drums .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters , put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 72,000 .
they enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing , as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they &apos;re using mri &apos;s to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well as movie marketing .
this is how i &apos;ve started to think , and this is certainly how i &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months as i &apos;ve been working on the book that will soon be published , as the dangerously , frighteningly over-anticipated follow up to my freakish success .
in both my vocation at robin hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter , i am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale , but i &apos;m also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis .
now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages in two coronary arteries and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist who &apos;s batting 200 on angioplasties .
but when i was on the phone with him , asking why he was going to do this surgery -- this was a very high-risk surgery -- his answer was that , in this other nation , these children were going to be treated very badly , and so he had to do this .
and to see when something is intuitive of course and how i , as a designer , can have influence on this and design things in such a way that they are a user friendly , so as intuitive as possible , because then the things are fun and easy to use .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physicians -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t handle sleep deprivation and those who can , those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes .
it also has three big problems : cost , particularly in highly regulated countries , is high ; the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human operators , that the fuel doesn &apos;t get used for weapons .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we &apos;re afraid , is really very deadening , and it &apos;s preventing millions of people from prospering .
now choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waistlines -- but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us even in very consequential decisions .
i don &apos;t need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner , there is always going to be another crazy , colorful , shiny outfit just waiting for me , if i put a little love in my heart and look .
so that &apos;s one effect . the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice , we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from .
this is a photograph i took at the northern tip of baffin island when i went narwhal hunting with some inuit people , and this man , olayuk , told me a marvelous story of his grandfather .
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the remembering self , and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn &apos;t need .
i mean , when i &apos;m in an elevator all alone , i do all sorts of weird things , but then other people get on board and i stop doing those things because i don &apos;t want to bother them , or , frankly , scare them .
in the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services delivered per person .
i met these guys called grl , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then , with a laser pointer , draw on it , and it just registers the negative space .
so what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution , and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
so , we &apos;ve got big cost challenges here , we have transmission challenges : for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere .
but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability is if we start with co2 as its feedstock , and so we &apos;re working with designing cells to go down this road .
i started to research scientific literature on how these centrifuges are actually built in natanz and found they are structured in what is called a cascade , and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges .
now , the fascinating things are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana are mao inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine . so you ask yourself a question .
this is a problem because the warming heats up the frozen ground around the arctic ocean , where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which , when it thaws , is turned into methane by microbes .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and creepy -- obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
so , perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this curve , on moore &apos;s law , and experiences price performance doubling every 12 to 24 months .
and then the founder of do-it-yourself-bio dot org came and said : okay
he said to me , &quot; i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence , and you &apos;ve been making liar out of me ever since . &quot;
what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down , so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next , we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
that means we feel so guilty on this planet , that we say , there is no organic agriculture , no bioland , no nature-et-progrès or whatever they &apos;re all called , that permits our own excrement to be put back into the cycle .
i became enamored of the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in single-celled organisms , each cell simply divides , and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells .
it was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because , check this out , the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the difference between that chunk of metal and you .
and then i stuck to it until nineteen ninety six and then i became the co-founder of the company solon together with friends , which then became one of the biggest cell manufacturers in the world together with the spin-off q-cells .
that was also an affront at the time , where the gentry , clergymen and others said : have you gone mad , if the people start to read , they &apos;ll want to have something to say and that would be totally fatal of course .
in spain , when a performer has done something impossible and magic , &quot; allah , ole , ole , allah , magnificent , bravo , &quot; incomprehensible , there it is -- a glimpse of god .
so what happens in &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; is that everything from top to bottom , from start to finish , is branded from beginning to end -- from the above-the-title sponsor that you &apos;ll see in the movie , which is brand x .
and so the message is this , we have to make do without these rotating masses , if we actually want to reach our goal of twenty , twenty , twenty percent , twenty , thirty , thirty percent etc .
well , they took , over a three-month period , d-level students , gave them a &apos;s , told them they were &quot; a &apos;s , &quot; told them they were bright , and at the end of this three-month period , they were performing at a-level .
but this has in it -- what i did is i took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it -- and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna and amplified it 10 to the 22 times .
and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong , powerful and athletic person well into the future .
and it &apos;s collected by my general practitioner as well , so he can see what &apos;s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that i need cardiologic support or something like it , but also looking backward .
but , in fact , the print date was the early 1980s , when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
it &apos;s a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the lhc , colliding with a piece of the lhc deliberately , and showering particles into the detector .
he killed 400,000 of his people by insisting that beetroot , garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of aids .
and finally , i believe that , despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating , we will ultimately not be judged by our technology , we won &apos;t be judged by our design , we won &apos;t be judged by our intellect and reason .
instead , what i do and what the designers at thinking machines do is we think at some level of abstraction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much farther and faster than we could ever do .
and since then , i &apos;ve conducted about 70 design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects , even the ctos of the fortune 50 , and there &apos;s something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and i &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
and there you see that , that people a our seven senses , most people think we only have five , but today there are seven officially recognised senses , and in the near future the next , the eighth sense will probably be added to it and as an extension of ourselves again .
what you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to take all the co2 , after you &apos;ve burned it , going out the flue , pressurize it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it stays there .
and in a miracle , he lifted his own violin and he started playing , by ear , certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete -- mendelssohn , tchaikovsky , sibelius .
i committed to his brother and his father right then and there -- i &apos;m like , &quot; all right , here &apos;s the deal : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to get him a machine , and we &apos;re going to figure out a way for him to do his art again .
now i have to confess , when i was a college undergraduate , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but with each passing year , i &apos;ve come to have increasing doubts .
i &apos;m a historian by training , and what i study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy -- meaning human bodies , animal bodies -- how they dealt with bodily fluids , concepts of bodies ; how have they thought about bodies .
because i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the secretary of hhs who &apos;s saying , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts on mammograms , &quot; or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas .
so when i now that &apos;s what the what profilers do at a crime scene , they go there , collect some hair samples , and then they make these implement this method , and then they can say , okay , this hair belongs to this person , like that .
he skinned the dog and improvised a harness , took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled , harnessed up an adjacent dog , and disappeared over the ice floes , shit knife in belt .
the reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it &apos;s dwarfism , or it &apos;s conjoined twinning , or it &apos;s an intersex type -- are often normalized by surgeons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health .
because -- in the end it &apos;s like this , o.k. -- centuries ago in the deserts of north africa , people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours , until dawn .
so i wrote a story about that too , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; frankenfoods , &quot; why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a haphazard way , was trespassing on nature &apos;s ground .
then came the next ones , which already worked with a neural model or mental model , as software ergonomists say , because you &apos;d have a conception of something , a metaphor , a metaphor of a desktop , to make the computer usable .
the spirits can be invoked from beneath the great water , responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living , so that for that brief shining moment , the acolyte becomes the god .
it happened at a piano course for music students given by my beloved old teacher professor j<<unk>> gen ude , a well-known beethoven specialist , concert pianist and longstanding professor at the conservatory here in stuttgart .
but that &apos;s my my prototype , which looked pretty wild though , on a branch and that , that thing on it , put the electronics into it and connected pressure to it and that was but the pressure was too high , and the thing broke .
we took a ps3 camera , hacked it open , mounted it to an led light , and now there &apos;s a device that is free -- you build this yourself , we publish the code for free , you download the software for free .
we look into this network , see the fifty hertz , and if it turns into forty nine point nine hertz , we start to open a few small valves , then a little more steam can enter , and then it goes up again .
so a couple of years ago i started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to hate ; we have them work in government .
by doing that simple thing , there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent .
there &apos;s evidence that neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury , and perhaps it &apos;s because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community .
and so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle , for low-level property crimes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victimized .
and the idea here is , imagine , again , we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to impart what we call cloud raising -- like barn raising , but with a cloud .
but always always with this this approach , that it should be simple and accessible .
and the question to me becomes : what do we do , as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy , that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that &apos;s been based on anatomy might start falling apart ?
to finish , i brought along , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which are the final bachelor &apos;s projects by michael burk , ann-kathrin krenz , joris klause and jan-moritz <<unk>> ller .
better than that , the things that you and i spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- gps , hd video and still images , libraries of books and music , medical diagnostic technology -- are now literally dematerializing and demonetizing into your cellphone .
henry , by virtue of being assumed to be male -- although i haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s the xy one -- by virtue of being assumed to be male is now liable to be drafted , which mary does not need to worry about .
finally , one consequence of buying a bad-fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear : the world is responsible . what could you do ?
he said , &quot; when we were in eastern europe and dealing with oppression , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an orientation of the spirit , a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and be a witness . &quot;
in this way certain words come into being that we also use again and again in the language of political correctness .
i think that interactive media address archaic , cognitive models in us , in other words thought patterns that were programmed into our biological memory a very , very long time ago and can be elicited through interactive media .
descendants of the ancient tairona civilization which once carpeted the caribbean coastal plain of colombia , in the wake of the conquest , these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the caribbean coastal plain .
and against that background , within the area of natural user interface design , so the next generation of the interaction between humans and computers in the i mean in the relationship between humans and computers , i looked into how our tools , or how the computer has successively transformed itself from a calculator to a digital assistant .
and i know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; great , let &apos;s make that language yoruba . let &apos;s make it cantonese .
so , she &apos;s running to the house and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the poem passes through her , and she grabs a pencil just as it &apos;s going through her , and then she said , it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it .
i mean , from this entry , it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them , when in fact , today i &apos;m celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life has procured .
this is was the problem : transparency -- free from pretense or deceit ; easily detected or seen through ; readily understood ; characterized by visibility or accessibility of information , especially concerning business practices -- that last line being probably the biggest problem .
we have this bucket list , we have these things we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to reach out to that i didn &apos;t , all the fences i wanted to mend , all the experiences i wanted to have and i never did .
if we change the plastic , so it can go into biological systems , if we change the water tank , inside , so they can go back to a cellulose base , you &apos;ll be able to plant one hundred and fifty trees in israel or tunisia with one baby .
and it turns out that , below an income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans -- and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , like 600,000 , so it &apos;s a large representative sample -- below an income of 600,000 dollars a year ...
so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it , embracing it , grappling with it , to use a wrestling term , maybe even dancing with it .
the congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the first world war .
so this whole discussion as to how things will be moved , the energy revolution , how to bring that about , on the island , for example , we have twenty-five-thirty percent excess energy , so we have to limit the wind and sun .
so we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped us in seattle , just over a year ago , to tag what they were throwing away -- different types of things , as you can see here -- things they would throw away anyway .
tan le , anonymous footscray resident , was now tan le , refugee and social activist , invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined .
they knew that about 75,000 hondurans every year would leave to go to the united states , and they wanted to ask , what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in honduras .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m italian originally , and every boy in italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom -- but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is that something very interesting happened in formula 1 racing over the past couple of decades .
as we did some of our subsequent expeditions , i was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them .
we think that polemics -- -- we think that polemics are not persuasive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world . we get 35 million hits on our website every month .
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans , because , i have to admit , that there are some golden retrievers i know that are probably more deserving of social services than some humans i know .
and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem-solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century -- the face of someone who , against all odds is on the verge of an epic win .
what kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , successive prototypes , always keeping the marshmallow on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way .
and then there are things that have already become part of everyday life , although most people are not aware of it , such as washing powder enzymes , which allow us to wash clothes at forty degrees , which are also genetically optimised enzymes .
and then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system -- speakers , cd player , tape player , tuner , amplifier -- and in this one single consumer electronics store , there are that many stereo systems .
i mean , they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did that i find myself watching that cheesy musical &quot; 1776 &quot; every few years , and it &apos;s not because of the music , which is totally forgettable .
and what we know from cross-cultural studies is that females , on average -- not everyone , but on average -- are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group .
i &apos;m glad to say we don &apos;t have the kind of situation with -- a surgeon i talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of conjoined twins in order to separate them , partly to make a name for himself .
in order to get target theories , we remember that it &apos;s definitely hardcore sabotage , it must be a high-value target and it is most likely located in iran , because that &apos;s where most of the infections had been reported .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s wise , given the importance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the geoengineering discussion about -- should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster , or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect ?
that was a massive outcry at the time , because of course it was when the lively language started to manifest itself in writing , meaning that i took something fluid and alive and started to carve it in stone and so manipulate it .
when the golden cat corporation got rid of their 10 worst-selling cat litter products , they saw an increase in profits by 87 percent -- a function of both increase in sales and lowering of costs .
so the tedtalk laid out in very simple terms , a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land , a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in , to go live under those rules or not .
we traced genealogies back eight generations , and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it , they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we speared him anyway .
when we look at its metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me , this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would yield a living cell .
if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- i could pick who &apos;s president , i could pick a vaccine , which is something i love , or i could pick that this thing that &apos;s half the cost with no co2 gets invented -- this is the wish i would pick .
here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fighting fires when he &apos;s covered in four feet of snow .
and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be captain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explosion , doubled demand and things like that .
and then there is a remembering self , and the remembering self is the one that keeps score , and maintains the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question , &quot; how have you been feeling lately ? &quot;
now in the financial savings world , i think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offerings has actually been something that david laibson was heavily involved in designing , which was the program that they have at harvard .
about an hour after she had arrived home , after i &apos;d sent her home , she collapsed and her family called 911 and the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in severe shock .
but i do remember the lights on the oil rig off the malaysian coast and the young man who collapsed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first apple i tasted , given to me by the men on the rig .
now what this thing does is it intercepts the input values from sensors -- so for example , from pressure sensors and vibration sensors -- and it provides legitimate program code , which is still running during the attack , with fake input data .
how , in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants , do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way , created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
and there was a time when jeans came in one flavor , and you bought them , and they fit like crap , and they were incredibly uncomfortable , and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times , they started to feel ok .
and we could talk about why this is deceptive , why you don &apos;t notice there are only three fingers down here , because the mind , and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three . it groups them .
and these sounds and this rhythm depicted the geology and topography of a region and that of course also made it possible to defragment these songs and rearrange them so that you could move to the left and the right and could also return to the starting point .
and i think that there &apos;s theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them .
now how many times have we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected -- and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
that could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas before they &apos;d built these special information processing structures , that would have had to be learned evolutionarily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit .
for example , the anecdote that some present , as captain so-and-so observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
you know , genocide , the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned , but ethnocide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not condemned , it &apos;s universally , in many quarters , celebrated as part of a development strategy .
what if you could change the sperm and the ova , or change the newly fertilized egg , and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life -- eliminate the diabetes , eliminate the hemophilia , reduce the risk of cancer ?
at the bottom of the ocean , bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce , if fish were there , sous-vide cooked fish , nevertheless , have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them .
the great 20th-century geneticist , t.g. dobzhansky , who was also a communicant in the russian orthodox church , once wrote an essay that he titled &quot; nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution . &quot;
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experiencing self of patient a worse off , and you have the remembering self of patient a a lot better off , because now you have endowed patient a with a better story about his experience .
so , not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water purification plant -- and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
everybody who has anything to do with foreign languages knows that a translator can &apos;t just simply render a text in another language word for word , but must also understand the deeper meaning of the words and the context in which they appear , so that a meaningful translation can occur .
and , if i want to step back and look at everything , i can slice and dice my history , perhaps by my search history -- here , i was doing some nepotistic searching , looking for bing , over here for live labs pivot .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually extend the colonoscopy of patient a by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much .
you &apos;re doing it for the task itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is -- for the thrill of discovery , and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team .
and taking them down so that they had access -- astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments -- taking them down to the vents , and letting them see , and take samples and test instruments , and so on .
understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they don &apos;t have enough money put away , it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer .
and for this entire time , they are inculturated into the values of their society , values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic -- or we might say the ecological -- balance .
because the leaders in the government there in honduras would need help from partner countries , who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement , so everybody can trust that the charter really will be enforced .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video &apos;s really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play -- such as testicles -- and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust -- while at the same time being tremendous fun .
and he &apos;s speeding along , and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of melody , that comes into his head as inspiration often comes , elusive and tantalizing , and he wants it , you know , it &apos;s gorgeous , and he longs for it , but he has no way to get it .
another example : a few years ago i got a call from a man who was 19 years old , who was born a boy , raised a boy , had a girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside .
but with only one company , one agency willing to help me -- and that &apos;s only because i knew john bond and richard kirshen<<unk>> for years -- i realized that i would have to go on my own , i &apos;d have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team .
in fact , most of my career , i &apos;ve been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging , that make them interesting , that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience .
and you know , that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever i wasn &apos;t in school i was out in the woods , hiking and taking &quot; samples &quot; -- frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water -- and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscope .
and she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her , she could collect it and grab it on the page .
over the next few weeks , i beat myself up and i experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where i felt alone , isolated , not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues .
now , i may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appetite i have for consuming memories , but even if you do more of this , there is a genuine question : why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere , and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations , intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness .
so whereas the fathers were extremely attentive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept , what we would have is more of a concept of , not just how to protect , but how to care for each other .
the main reason for this is because , we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls of mayonnaises , mustards , vinegars , jams , but we can &apos;t actually do the math of comparing and contrasting and actually picking from that stunning display .
and through playing music and talking about music , this man had transformed from the paranoid , disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown los angeles to the charming , erudite , brilliant , juilliard-trained musician .
and we were talking about this , and you know , tom , for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist , trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses that were totally internalized .
now i &apos;m going to describe to you a study i did with gur huberman , emir kamenica , wei jang where we looked at the retirement savings decisions of nearly a million americans from about 650 plans all in the u.s .
well the answer is , if i drew it on a normal curve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that i &apos;m trying to graph , the graphs look sort of silly .
and when i think about that , i think about a vacation we had in antarctica a few years ago , which was clearly the best vacation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think of it relatively often , relative to how much i think of other vacations .
and it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-human futures that i can imagine , as a science fiction fan .
most companies tend to -- and it &apos;s human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure of , avoid fear , those elements , and you really embrace those , and you actually turn them into positives for you , and it &apos;s a neat thing to see .
we don &apos;t have a situation that iran has , for example , where a man who &apos;s sexually attracted to other men is liable to be murdered , unless he &apos;s willing to submit to a sex change , in which case he &apos;s allowed to live .
and they will get healthier by using the tricorder , and they &apos;ll become better educated by using the khan academy , and by literally being able to use 3d printing and infinite computing &#91; become &#93; more productive than ever before .
in fact , we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn &apos;t draw the line for us between male and female , or between male and intersex and female and intersex ; we actually draw that line on nature .
there are technical concepts such as <<unk>> augmented reality <<unk>> .
for some time i have been interested in the placebo effect , which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that i do , which is , &quot; something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . &quot;
we &apos;ve been working with roberto bolle , one of today &apos;s top ballet dancers -- the étoile at metropolitan in new york and la scala in milan -- and actually captured his movement in 3d in order to use it as an input for flyfire .
now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full percentage , that will be very tricky , and agreeing on where these co2 quantities should be put will be hard , but the toughest one here is this long-term issue .
so what you were getting was this : your name here presents : my ted talk that you have no idea what the subject is and , depending on the content , could ultimately blow up in your face , especially if i make you or your company look stupid for doing it .
and it &apos;s within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish . and there are great moments of optimism .
and these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; mr. stevenson , you give talks , you make speeches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot;
people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , &quot; well yeah , that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there &apos;s a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be bleeding .
but as a result now , he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes , the worst of which can manifest themselves as and then disappearing for days , wandering the streets of skid row , exposed to its horrors , with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him .
he was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and how the dodgers were never going to make the world series , all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape , we either invoke rousseau and the old canard of the &quot; noble savage , &quot; which is an idea racist in its simplicity , or alternatively , we invoke thoreau and say these people are closer to the earth than we are .
i wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep , the three of us still in the same bed .
but we don &apos;t even blink when we hear somebody say this because we &apos;ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we &apos;ve completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry , in the end , will always ultimately lead to anguish .
and what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been deployed all across the world -- that &apos;s a cellphone network -- and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network , that &apos;s collected anyway by the operator , in order to understand how the city works .
and then the renaissance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was let &apos;s put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine .
in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or , indeed , a prognosis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don &apos;t put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable someone .
i have talked about four techniques for mitigating the problem of choice overload -- cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives ; concretize -- make it real ; categorize -- we can handle more categories , less choices ; condition for complexity .
because we want this self-deception , this feeling of being brilliant , descended from the highest beings , not from that natural level , from something as unpredictable as an organism that exists much like a stone and other such things , that &apos;s unbearable for us .
and that &apos;s that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the dmv and all those other things that we &apos;re really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of tim o &apos;reilly , &quot; what we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
so , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea , so i &apos;ll say it again , let it sink in : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , obesity , i believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade .
and our aim was , we wanted to reach seventy to ninety percent renewable energies and then this remainder is still here , the last remainder , the last ten , twenty percent renewable energies with , that will will be very , very expensive and generating this from batteries won &apos;t work either .
but we did get 17 brand partners who were willing to relinquish that control , who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn &apos;t be able to tell -- stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind .
in fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not , and so it &apos;s through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that , yes , with the right material &apos;s approach , this looks like it would work .
but the process , and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie , the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble , and released it kind of back where it came from , and realized that this didn &apos;t have to be this internalized , tormented thing .
and the peculiar thing is that i recently wrote this book , this memoir called &quot; eat , pray , love &quot; which , decidedly unlike any of my previous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , mega-sensation , international bestseller thing .
there &apos;s always one continent left out , the assumption being that sub-saharan africa had no religious beliefs . well , of course , they did and voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic diaspora of the slavery era .
but in fact , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those extraneous redundant options , well there &apos;s an increase in sales , there &apos;s a lowering of costs , there is an improvement of the choosing experience .
and , one day , he came in to my session -- exhaustive and unforgiving , these sessions -- and he said to me , &quot; wow . aimee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , i think you &apos;re going to break one of those bands .
and we simulated wind and sun and the load , and the result , a very exciting result , was that compared to the conventional system , which needs a medium electricity price of about fifty cents per kwh after twenty years , you &apos;d arrive at about forty-four cents .
and a problem , so not only a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also just be an access problem that simplifying things , so any way of looking at a problem , of posing a question , asking how you could do something differently or better .
feed grain to herbivores , pesticides to monocultures , chemicals to soil , chicken to fish , and all along agribusiness has simply asked , &quot; if we &apos;re feeding more people more cheaply , how terrible could that be ? &quot;
not by the latest combine and tractor invention , but by fertile land ; not by pumps , but by fresh water ; not by chainsaws , but by forests ; and not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
those are it has a more arty character , so it &apos;s many artists and philosophers are working , together with scientists , on examining these technologies and asking questions and processing the knowledge creatively , there are museum exhibitions and , well , all sorts of things .
if you sum up the co2 that gets emitted , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects : the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the indirect effects , in that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adjust to these rapid changes , and so you get ecosystem collapses .
up attributes are things like being playful , being fresh like the fresh prince , contemporary , adventurous , edgy or daring like errol flynn , nimble or agile , profane , domineering , magical or mystical like gandalf .
and other times she wouldn &apos;t be fast enough , so she &apos;d be running and running and running , and she wouldn &apos;t get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape , looking , as she put it &quot; for another poet . &quot;
those may make some contribution , and if they can do better than i expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look daunting , because they all have significant challenges .
and when you see how far removed we are from what we wanted to and could achieve , and how sad we are to be on this planet in the first place , you can understand why offenbach , for example , has a program to be climate neutral by twenty forty , right ?
in my 20 years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism , i &apos;ve made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors to learn everything i can , from one of the first articles i wrote for the toronto star to my show &quot; white coat , black art . &quot;
with its complete transparency , which is the new kind of thinking that clashes with the old kind of thinking : don &apos;t say that there &apos;s now horse meat in the lasagne and not beef or other phenomena , because i want to cover that up and not confess to it .
so , not exactly what i was hoping for , but off i went -- up the stairs , down the hall , past the &apos; real &apos; firefighters , who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point , into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes .
i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick , elastic bands -- different colors , you know -- to help build up my leg muscles , and i hated these bands more than anything -- i hated them , had names for them . i hated them .
but we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome -- it &apos;s over 580,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we &apos;d build them in cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are .
and the conversation i had with dean kamen this morning , one of the great diy innovators , i &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me permission to do so -- his technology called slingshot that many of you may have heard of , it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator .
cloud computing , what my friends at autodesk call infinite computing ; sensors and networks ; robotics ; 3d printing , which is the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet ; synthetic biology ; fuels , vaccines and foods ; digital medicine ; nanomaterials ; and a.i .
so you see these astonishing demonstrations : voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity , a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation .
and it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience i &apos;ve ever had , because i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it , because i had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush with a center branching out in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms : it has survived ; it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment .
and so with this premises with this premises , brian degger in england , for example , tried to set up a mini-laboratory , took a pressure cooker , a hot plate and , yes , soup stock , and bred bacteria with it , working like this .
we really need to meet up now , meet up personally , and he organised two events , one in london , in two thousand ten , and shortly after that in the usa , in san francisco .
this equation has four factors , a little bit of multiplication : so , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , co2 , that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the services each person &apos;s using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the co2 being put out per unit of energy .
and the insight of president lobo was that that assurance of enforcement that i was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust .
i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing , it was so ludicrous , but i &apos;d just gotten past &quot; mangled , &quot; and my voice broke , and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed .
a group from ankara , that i came into contact with a while ago , they have they are a student group that wanted to inform the public more about what what they learn about at university , and they organised these these little actions at street festivals and tried to explain dna to people .
175 salad dressings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 extra-virgin olive oils and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings , in the off-chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you .
and that was really very , very bitter and then you end up in one of these phases just now you saw that image with don &apos;t give up written on it , where i asked myself after ten years , whether the one thousand <<unk>> mark it was at the time , the basic pay , a uniform pay in the collective of course , whether that was really such a great thing .
what i &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as i can , is some foundational work , some new technology that we brought to microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago . this is seadragon , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data .
firstly , when you are growing up as a child , as a baby , the thing you are interested in is which what sort of excretions you have , right ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed you to more or less play with your potty and stir its contents , your curiosity is of course awakened .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i calculated , you know , the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 600,000 -- most of them don &apos;t leave a trace .
bil gates : to actually do the software , buy the supercomputer , hire all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
that really works , it &apos;s done in an academic setting , and then we thought , okay , we might manage that , and took a webcam , dismantled it , took off the lens , turned it around and then we have a microscope , which has a four hundred fold magnification approximately .
if i show you 600 magazines and i divide them up into 10 categories , versus i show you 400 magazines and divide them up into 20 categories , you believe that i have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if i gave you the 400 than if i gave you the 600 .
it &apos;s friday , friday . gotta get down on friday . everybody &apos;s looking forward to the weekend , weekend . friday , friday . gettin &apos; down on friday . so you didn &apos;t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video i hope .
i believe a significant -- not the only , but a significant -- contributor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they &apos;re at fault .
the neolithic revolution -- which gave us agriculture , at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed ; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood ; we created hierarchy specialization surplus -- is only 10,000 years ago .
this is when you focus a laser beam on a in a space , and then you can catch little particles in the air with it or in in liquid and then move them in this focus , so , they &apos;re then trapped in there , so it &apos;s basically like a tractor beam .
if we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility -- or potency , to be even a little bit more dangerous -- we can release the power of so many more children , and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
you know , when michelangelo sculpted the moses , at the end it said that he took the hammer , threw it at the moses -- actually you can still see a small chip underneath -- and said , shouted , &quot; perché non parli ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
but today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , he could tell you much more about sensing and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing , but i wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning , and that &apos;s actuating our environment .
now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
i then tried to expand this at my laboratory back home , and so i bought some secondhand equipment on ebay and did a little dna analysis , and tried to do a paternity test , so dna fingerprinting in other words , at home again .
and if you would choose a different vacation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in terms of memories , you might get another answer .
in the early &apos; 80s , i had a really astonishing assignment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to haiti , infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of duvalier &apos;s strength and tonton macoutes , and securing the poison used to make zombies .
the human ability to adapt , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity , and i &apos;m going to make an admission : this phrase never sat right with me , and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and i think i &apos;m starting to figure out why .
and if i now transfer this , if i let orient take shape as an overview , select as a selection , inform in the case that it comes up close to me , and i can look at in detail , and yes , transact means i can put it somewhere or send someone or do the shopping , etc . ,
i encourage all of you to read steve &apos;s book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bond , and ultimately was instrumental -- if you &apos;ll pardon the pun -- in helping nathaniel get off the streets .
that here is biocurious , the hackerspace i mentioned just now , this yes , basically a kind of adult education centre for for molecular biology .
no biologists , for example , would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity -- scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity .
bg : well , we haven &apos;t picked a particular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear , &quot; so we &apos;ve got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in russia , india , china -- i &apos;ve been back seeing the secretary of energy here , talking about how this fits into the energy agenda .
the computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots -- all taken near grassi lakes in the canadian rockies -- all these shots were taken . so you see elements here of stabilized slide-show or panoramic imaging , and these things have all been related spatially .
and if you look at some of the software in those terms , then you &apos;ll understand why ninety-nine percent of today &apos;s software is less intuitive or not instantaneously usable , including the ipad in many areas or the iphone , although it &apos;s already a lot more intuitive than classical software .
and the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy , &quot; which makes it sound like a good thing , but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision-making from somebody who knows something -- namely , the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions -- namely , the patient .
this idea , it saved me when i was in the middle of writing &quot; eat , pray , love , &quot; and i fell into one of those , sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , this is going to be the worst book ever written .
we also brought one of these diesel aggregates to the hall , in the same size as it is there , for the complete dynamic behavior of this network to actually be , so in the hall it looks like this now , the diesel is behind it , here &apos;s the big battery , here are all the converters , with which we simulate the network .
they believed that a genius was this , sort of magical divine entity , who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio , kind of like dobby the house elf , and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work .
if i can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about information overload , what i &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible .
so a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro previtero , we did a study with people at ing -- employees that are all working at ing -- and now these people were all in a session where they &apos;re doing enrollment for their 401 plan .
curious historical footnote -- when the moors invaded southern spain , they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from &quot; allah , allah , allah , &quot; to &quot; ole , ole , ole , &quot; which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances .
now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this -- something that monitors the car in real time , has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car , transmitting this information into the system , and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected .
and i was afraid , not for myself , but i was afraid that i was going to lose him , that he was going to sink into one of his states , and that i would ruin his relationship with the violin if i started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy .
well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
so , i wrote this piece called &quot; avatar , &quot; which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects , of cg effects , beyond , with realistic human emotive characters generated in cg , and the main characters would all be in cg , and the world would be in cg .
i probably belong , are those two friendly girls still here , i probably belong to the generation that created this bad ecological image , because i already started to study engineering at the technical university in karlsruhe in nineteen seventy nine , i think it &apos;s called kit today .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a question-and-answer session after one of my lectures reported a story , and that was a story -- he said he &apos;d been listening to a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording , there was a dreadful screeching sound .
you know , i think that allowing somebody , one mere person to believe that he or she is like , the vessel , you know , like the font and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , unknowable , eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile , human psyche .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the co2 constraints , then the skeptics say , &quot; ok , i don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out co2 , i kind of wish it did put out co2 , but i guess i &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than what &apos;s come before . &quot;
it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose , then the one that chooses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be chosen .
you know that healthy kind , when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then your best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions , but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say , i &apos;ll never make that mistake again .
you know , one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stones polished by rain , taste it in the bitter leaves of plants .
if you should ever have the chance to staff your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow scott silverman did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an opossum stuck in your house .
the nice thing about that is that when you do that , so when you practice agriculture , generate biogas , on one hectare of land with five thousand inhabitants in the favelas , a farmer can earn about one thousand five hundred dollars and maintain the plot with it , raise chickens and pigs and ducks and grow vegetables and farm fish .
we &apos;re on the verge of amazing , amazing events in many fields , and yet i actually think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the enlightenment , to find a time when we battled progress , when we fought about these things more vigorously , on more fronts , than we do now .
so by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic defects like depth of field , desaturated colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
if i were to walk into a room filled with my colleages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what i &apos;ve just told you right now , i probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable , somebody would crack a joke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .
now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid , take out your personal communications device -- i give you permission -- and perhaps take another look at kathryn schultz &apos;s book on being wrong , because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you .
a couple of years ago , the lasker prize was awarded to the scientist shinya yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell , a fibroblast , and by manipulating just four genes , he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell -- a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body .
and , to dimensionalize this , i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made -- for cars , for computers , for phones , for flashlights , for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses , and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
now let &apos;s take a step back in time to the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years -- the first signs of proto-life , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first multi-celled organisms , perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species , finally emerging in the last 130,000 years .
this is a reconstruction of notre dame cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from flickr . you just type notre dame into flickr , and you get some pictures of guys in t-shirts , and of the campus and so on . and each of these orange cones represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we execute people -- where you &apos;re 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white -- in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched .
i once travelled 6,000 miles from chengdu in western china overland through southeastern tibet to lhasa with a young colleague , and it was only when i got to lhasa that i understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes , 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the cultural revolution .
and so , when you have all sorts of urgent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later , and a somewhat uncertain pain thing -- in fact , the ipcc report , that &apos;s not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at ipcc and say , &quot; ok , that isn &apos;t that big of a deal . &quot;
we purified a chromosome from one microbial species -- roughly , these two are as distant as human and mice -- we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome , we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins , and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell -- and you &apos;ll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here .
margaret mead , the great anthropologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities .
i would like to jump straight to one of noah &apos;s original data-sets -- and this is from an early prototype of photosynth that we first got working in the summer -- to show you what i think is really the punch line behind this technology , the photosynth technology . and it &apos;s not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments that we &apos;ve put up on the website .
in other words , sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies , the placebo effect , just because the person thinks that what &apos;s happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a -- for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
if one person said no , there was the veto principle , which was totally demoralising , for ten years , i i had grave doubts as to whether i was perhaps really wasting my great engineering degree on something ridiculous , also because all my father &apos;s colleagues had told him , you wasted your money on your child .
i had this encounter recently where i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone , who &apos;s now in her 90s , but she &apos;s been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural virginia , she would be out working in the fields , and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape .
it means that a young kid from the andes who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined .
because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and i thought that , since i was among friends here , i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it .
and so , that would be your response to the bjorn lomborg argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth , it &apos;s a stupid waste of the earth &apos;s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
these guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
and ms. parks used to come back to montgomery every now and then , and she would get together with two of her dearest friends , these older women , johnnie carr who was the organizer of the montgomery bus boycott -- amazing african american woman -- and virginia durr , a white woman , whose husband , clifford durr , represented dr. king .
and they have there were two two tinkerers who went to work on it and said , okay , we can make this easier and cheaper , and put together this this piece of equipment from open source stuff , so freely available hardware and electronics and they &apos;re now the they &apos;ve now managed to make it ripe for the market and are currently the the cheapest providers of these devices worldwide .
that made me a different human being than my friends amongst the kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of huxwhukw and the crooked beak of heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world , spirits they would have to engage during their hamatsa initiation .
just a week ago , the national academy of engineering awarded its draper prize to francis arnold and willem stemmer , two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way -- what frances arnold calls &quot; directed evolution . &quot;
and so now you find it in biology , and i &apos;d like to take a metaphor from synthetic biology , biology is actually an information science because the dna code is an abstract code that yes , it &apos;s not exactly like a computer , because it &apos;s more dynamic , because it &apos;s material , i mean real material , and not just cybernetic .
and has nothing more to do with reality .
that &apos;s right , some lucky individual , corporation , for-profit or non-profit , was going to get the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let it happen again -- to buy the naming rights to the talk you &apos;re watching right now , that at the time didn &apos;t have a title , didn &apos;t really have a lot of content and didn &apos;t really give much hint as to what the subject matter would actually be .
implicit in this phrase of &quot; overcoming adversity &quot; is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience , as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics , or what other people perceive as my disability .
and when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world , it wasn &apos;t an mit professor , it wasn &apos;t a caltech student , it was a person from england , from manchester , a woman who , during the day , was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic and , at night , was the world &apos;s best protein folder .
now , of course , this was a simple ploy on dr. p &apos;s part to get me to do the exercises i didn &apos;t want to do before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward , but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me .
and , as i &apos;ve been looking over the last year for models for how to do that i &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people , sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity .
so what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes , the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable anatomical categories that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fuzzy than we thought .
so i went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this , and we were like , &quot; well wait a second . if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things , why don &apos;t we figure out a way for tempt to control a laser and he could do graf again ? well that would be awesome . &quot;
and so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of , say , coal , and so -- if you can deal with the negatives , which are essentially the radiation -- the footprint and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
certainly , from a medical standpoint , my legs , laser surgery for vision impairment , titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them -- not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self-identify , to claim their own descriptions of themselves , so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing .
&quot; disabled , adjective : crippled , helpless , useless , wrecked , stalled , maimed , wounded , mangled , lame , mutilated , run-down , worn-out , weakened , impotent , castrated , paralyzed , handicapped , senile , decrepit , laid-up , done-up , done-for , done-in cracked-up , counted-out ; see also hurt , useless and weak .
i will leave the final word to an english scientist , humphrey davy , who , i suspect , when defending his protege &apos;s useless experiments -- his protege was michael faraday -- said this , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our triumphs are complete , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . &quot;
and what we &apos;re doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradually , one by one , the central revelation of anthropology : that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being .
one of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , you know , what salad dressing is ? -- it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better . and what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made , and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made , even if it was a good decision .
and at the end of this amazing initiation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sunrise . and in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory . and the priest steps back and says , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really as i &apos;ve told you .
the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood , whether winning a second grade spelling bee , marching with the girl scouts , you know , the halloween parade , winning my college scholarship , or any of my sports victories , and he was using it , and integrating it into teaching resident students , med students from hahnemann medical school and hershey medical school .
and now you see the soul as having something of a cloud like nature , an airy nature , it &apos;s called anima in latin , being like a breath of air .
so , as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects -- along with my adviser pattie , and my collaborator jeevan kalanithi -- i started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop , what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically , arranging it the way we wanted ?
right , i &apos;d like to summarise my my presentation by stating that the characteristics and abilities that we acquired during the age of feudalism , and which went a little lost during the machine age , that they can be reactivated with the help of the so-called cyber age and so that we can , in this way , actually go back to our roots rather than the future through complex , technological , new products .
the young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years : two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s womb ; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother .
at one point , javier said to octavio , &quot; what if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an embassy -- give some to the u.s. embassy ; give some to the canadian embassy -- and then if people want to go work under the rules of canada or under the rules of the united states , they can go get jobs , do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to canada or the u.s. to do ? &quot;
i &apos;d like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth-century persian poet named hafiz that my friend , jacques dembois told me about , and the poem is called &quot; the god who only knows four words &quot; : &quot; every child has known god , not the god of names , not the god of don &apos;ts , but the god who only knows four words and keeps repeating them , saying , &apos; come dance with me .
if somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are , then my photo of notre dame cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data , and i can use it as an entry point to dive into that space , into that meta-verse , using everybody else &apos;s photos , and do a kind of a cross-modal and cross-user social experience that way .
a huge success story , but there too we have the problem of a growing company and then in two thousand and six , we , a small group , decided that we would start small again and go back and would dedicate ourselves to the next topic of the future , which , in my opinion , and in our opinion , and it &apos;s crazy again , it starts with people saying , what &apos;s this nonsense about , that won &apos;t work . i &apos;m talking about storage .
there &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the asmat or in the chilling winds of tibet , but they have , nevertheless , through time and ritual , forged a traditional mystique of the earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it , but on a far subtler intuition : the idea that the earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness .
so the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fosters in a loving , supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mistakes , we &apos;re rewarded for coming clean .
in fact , i used to argue with my professor , richard evan shultes -- who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the 1930s -- i used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hallucination .
and i &apos;m telling a story that many of you know , because steve &apos;s columns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with robert downey jr. acting as steve lopez , and jamie foxx as nathaniel anthony ayers , the juilliard-trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia .
what happened was women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the founding fathers &apos; concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and said , &quot; the fact that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn &apos;t have the right to vote , the right to full citizenship , the right to own property , etc . , etc . &quot;
now we all , or a big part of us , use gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents use foreign services like gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over ssl connections , so the local government can &apos;t snoop on their discussions .
and i wound up getting involved with the space community , really involved with nasa , sitting on the nasa advisory board , planning actual space missions , going to russia , going through the pre-cosmonaut biomedical protocols , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3d camera systems .
on my show , on &quot; white coat , black art , &quot; i made it a habit of saying , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everybody from paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about yours ? &quot; and i would point the microphone towards them .
when you come back to the shore and you say , &quot; we had to do this , and the fiber optic , and the attentuation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the difficulty , the human-performance aspects of working at sea , &quot; you can &apos;t explain it to people . it &apos;s that thing that maybe cops have , or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away ; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to : whether it &apos;s the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the penan -- a nomadic people from southeast asia , from sarawak -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers , where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of borneo away to the south china sea , where the japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest -- or , in the case of the yanomami , it &apos;s the disease entities that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
the oil shortage is fictional , but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve run out of oil . so when you come to the game , you sign up , you tell us where you live , and then we give you real-time news , videos , data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs , what &apos;s not available , how food supply is being affected , how transportation is being affected , if schools are closed , if there is rioting , and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true . and then we ask you to blog about it , to post videos , to post photos .
what makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation , but the elaboration of it . it &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines , harmine , harmaline , mildly hallucinogenic -- to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness -- but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called psychotria viridis .
just to know that jaguar shamans still journey beyond the milky way , or the myths of the inuit elders still resonate with meaning , or that in the himalaya , the buddhists still pursue the breath of the dharma , is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made , albeit successfully , many generations ago .
how can i speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations , about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four-year-old girl huddled with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the china sea more than 30 years ago , bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in san francisco and speaking to you today ?
and whether it is the penan in the forests of borneo , or the voodoo acolytes in haiti , or the warriors in the kaisut desert of northern kenya , the curandero in the mountains of the andes , or a caravanserai in the middle of the sahara -- this is incidentally the fellow that i traveled into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of qomolangma , everest , the goddess mother of the world .
