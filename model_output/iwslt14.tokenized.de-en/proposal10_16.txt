thank you .

thank you .
thank you .
from seattle ...
i don &apos;t know .
because that &apos;s the singing .
but it goes .
it &apos;s not going to happen .
yes , hello .
we love innovation .
solar technology is ...
that &apos;s not ...
we were poor .
are all that ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
after a week .
great trick ?
that &apos;s what we were .
a few less .
and he says ...
we know that .
ta-da !
twice .
here it is .
that &apos;s going fast .
they need time .
music as language .
that &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... not yet .
thank you .
what a fish .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
that &apos;s efficient .
wonderful , isn &apos;t it ?
completely efficient .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much .
bern them .
the only chance .
not a hospital too .
thank you very much .
stephen watts .
three out of 10 .
that was incredible .
thank you . thank you .
yeah , sort of .
it &apos;s terrible .
long , yes .
fantastic , right ?
the sun goes to the sun .
oh my god .
we love entertainment .
we pick up .
after home ?
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we lose them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
a whole lot .
does that sound good ?
all the environmental discussion .
sounds familiar , what ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
that &apos;s great .
that was fascinating .
can i be honest ?
the farm is incredible .
what did they do ?
robert gupta .
that &apos;s the system .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
yes , good day .
lento , slowly .
that &apos;s all interested in me .
we can do that .
so what do you say ?
not very sustainable .
yes , milliseconds .
that &apos;s our present .
they have similar principles .
yes , good day .
good work ! yeah !
just do your job .
this was the result .
thank you very much .
and she did .
so they meet al .
it &apos;s essential .
they &apos;re all important .
very different term .
unbelievable .
that &apos;s me even .
besides shell .
yes , that &apos;s going .
flying cat .
this is the last one .
can we change it ?
these days are over .
these people deserve money .
what happened here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
consider them again .
and that &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know .
centers were built .
what happened here ?
but you know what ?
what was the result ?
i was amazed .
it &apos;s generic .
so they knew everything .
you could see manhattan .
here &apos;s the video .
it has sensors .
why not live longer ?
he opens the door .
a couple more .
that &apos;s very good .
oh , so the one .
there &apos;s no normal .
yeah , i know .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
but you know what ?
i have a question .
okay . thank you .
i was standing to him .
players don &apos;t sit around .
so you can do that .
they &apos;re bad . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
what do these people need ?
i don &apos;t think that .
i thought about it .
i think it &apos;s interesting .
they use their hands .
so how does this work ?
how they &apos;re interested .
that would have been okay .
what are media today ?
you can go into it .
so where do we go ?
so it &apos;s true .
how do we know that ?
because you know what ?
it &apos;s not a country .
why do we do that ?
not very often happens .
bg : thank you .
that &apos;s a wish .
and i was an artist .
let &apos;s call him don &apos;t .
not school school management .
and it &apos;s got to go back .
we can do it differently .
they even do weather .
and i understand that .
a tremendous challenge .
there &apos;s no food .
it &apos;s against justice .
but the wrong things .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
i &apos;m a writer .
here &apos;s another example .
i stayed children .
it feels great .
i swear it .
i wonder .
that &apos;s not going to be done .
thank you for listening .
why should we do that ?
thank you .
here &apos;s an example .
you see it immediately .
not toxic in it .
but i kept working on .
or bombs .
i &apos;m going to go there .
there are two options .
we need energy miracle .
why does this happen at all ?
oh . a moment .
i want to tell you .
what do you want to do ?
this is what happens to us today .
and i went on to work .
so she was back .
and that &apos;s how it was .
yes , here it is .
i agree to you completely .
and why is that ?
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what would everything have to be done ?
i mean the soul .
you do the same thing .
in china , it was different .
luckily , yes ?
but that &apos;s not a protection .
poor pee a chance .
does anybody see something particular ?
and i always had .
very expensive mobility .
people were playing crazy .
what creates the illusion ?
my gut feeling again .
after just a journey there .
first of all , limited .
i created one .
yeah . well . well , good .
imagine the camera .
jk : both of that .
but it &apos;s even worse .
here you see it .
thank you very much .
be a mentor .
maybe 10 times as many .
but it wasn &apos;t .
the data came in .
this is a great question .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
it has billions of those .
have you seen these guys ?
but there &apos;s something else .
here &apos;s another example .
is it photography at all ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
ohh .
and then it became international .
there were remixes .
let me summarize .
okay , a few more .
the answer is no .
just further . much fun .
my name is amit .
he had the experience .
it holds you fresh .
this is a great question .
is that your opinion ?
a almost identical structure .
and it was getting better .
that &apos;s what she was hot .
it has very much enjoyed him .
here you see the city .
good day , all together .
am i going to like the color ?
ooh , thank you .
some have come and went .
i think rather than that .
dk : 60,000 .
there &apos;s an old study .
it &apos;s not disappointed .
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s not true for emotions .
he &apos;s called paul open .
now , what do you think ?
who will make it safe ?
we first have the population .
i don &apos;t like that question .
but what &apos;s your fish ?
we call him a don &apos;t .
that &apos;s precise .
the work of the interpreted .
but where are we useful ?
they had no mass media .
how do we actually work people ?
... his own story .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
so what does that mean ?
well , what does that mean ?
privacy has to be given .
there are online criminals .
we have three main groups .
it was still fish .
he always showed up here .
and then it happened again .
i felt really good .
and many people forget this .
crisis . death . disaster .
it would be inerable .
it &apos;s not our fight .
it &apos;s not our problem .
we lost the contact .
why not think about it ?
we love technology and creativity .
it would be knowledge .
we &apos;re constantly pushing each other .
and this opens a map .
but what do we do with that ?
that &apos;s about it .
what am i looking at ?
his name is tempt .
will it have my size ?
that sounds crazy , right ?
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
we need to spread the message .
that &apos;s what most of us know .
you also have to understand that .
this is what you see down there .
i want to ask you something .
i &apos;m going to stop this .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
i find this fascinating .
i find this fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was destroyed on the ground .
and then it looks like this .
is it about light ?
i grew up in india .
that &apos;s the short-term .
you can see the water .
i had a good life .
so what happened for years ?
who are these relatives ?
i wanted to keep us healthy .
these changes are coming in .
how about fitness ?
that &apos;s exciting .
but the key thing is ...
it works like this .
and then they put them up .
what &apos;s actually happening there ?
the orange trajectory .
they really loved it .
but i felt bad .
the two smells me .
woman : survivors technology .
very horrible .
what &apos;s the soul ?
we &apos;re not producing anymore .
i can say everything .
he went down and down .
what else can we do ?
this is what the graph looked like .
now i &apos;m going to get to the end .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
it might sound sounds silly .
we were 20 people .
so we &apos;re too many .
you can &apos;t have bones .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
or may it be possible ?
from conflicts of conflicts of creativity .
so what do we need to do ?
they didn &apos;t have books .
this is felix .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
thank you for your attention .
that was the beginning of the journey .
i &apos;m terrifying .
and then everybody went down .
they saw the big exposure .
first versions , second .
well , i was the next one .
let &apos;s face -- who &apos;s normal ?
and finally , episode .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
the same thing , just bigger .
who is the most successful ?
you want to feed the world ?
i wanted to support them .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
i just loved two .
one place is south korea .
again , you &apos;ve got it again .
this is a natural thing .
my wife told me .
and how did that feel ?
that &apos;s what you can train .
does it make curiosity ?
so it &apos;s circle .
so why now hackers ?
this happened around christmas .
what is that for a thing ?
so , you know .
they could have done better .
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
i don &apos;t have to worry .
and that &apos;s not something else .
is that reasonable ?
so that &apos;s the good news .
it was a huge success .
so they saw something magic .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
but can &apos;t be a problem .
they always say , why ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
it was just not invented yet .
columns should be able to work .
anybody know what this is ?
for example , this perception in context .
this is a game for outside .
this is god , you know ?
but it was very sad .
so let me remind you .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
and is the ix .
sometimes i get too much .
but they &apos;re doing the job .
they connected these two people .
her mother moved them alone .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
think of your own decisions .
this picture is from this place .
i see this plushing sign .
and it took 18 months .
tell me about this world .
that &apos;s very risky .
and that worked very well .
and the again showed him four .
i learned everything .
and there are hundreds of them .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there &apos;s good news .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
that really made me sad .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
but it &apos;s not that fast .
how can we help you ? &quot;
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
no had never been an opportunity .
the story is not over .
what happened on this day ?
well , then we want to .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
they come from the artists .
i should not say that .
the power plant can explode .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
she did it for three years .
you can have this cloud .
the data was not available before .
game is not silly .
well , how could this happen ?
is this all just education ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
so that &apos;s what we can do .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
they don &apos;t have changed the story .
everybody talks about happiness today .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
play is not just child games .
and that was 19 years ago .
what would you love most ?
they create a episode story .
they have so much uncertainty .
the data lights it all the time .
no one ever said that before .
so paul is a terrorist .
and that &apos;s actually what he says .
don &apos;t take anything for you .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what should our beliefs look like ?
this is a lot of volume .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
i never cook with it .
she was back and dying .
and of course , this is incredible talks .
and here &apos;s the exhibition .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
a autistic student .
when you &apos;re at the moment , the waste is .
so not like detox .
and that &apos;s what we take .
we depend by two countries .
everybody needs a gold glass glass .
let &apos;s be your nei . &quot;
people were still happy .
it was my first sunbrand .
in fact , he collected fish .
my name is brian goldman .
they share their experiences with others .
the white lines are for population .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
he showed up on the algae .
it &apos;s just not technological .
there are four and a half thousand people .
and you have a problem .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
every waste is nutrients .
and we &apos;re too many .
so the question is : how ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and it was an incredible experience .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
but there are two problems .
i started feeling better .
but , you know what ?
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
that was a very good dio .
i &apos;m going to talk a lot about these questions .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
we &apos;re in a field .
and that &apos;s what we did .
basically , they do the same thing .
this is one of the images .
what other marks do ?
and then something weird happened .
you can play with different types .
the whole building was made of water .
item wins . yeah .
on the morning , before the game .
that wouldn &apos;t have any problem at all .
creativity had to be kind of out .
today , everything is easy to have .
the nurse asked the nurse .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
maybe even in our cell phones .
and it starts with a doctor .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
we use the energy of the sun .
these are all metadata .
i can say everything .
it will always be more similar .
slowly , it was safe .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
what are they trying to do ? &quot;
we &apos;re not going to go further .
what lessons do we have learned ?
and the shape plays a role .
you can &apos;t store energy .
then i can translate the whole thing .
okay , that really makes the courage .
once we started a living .
my second mistake was worse .
and it &apos;s a 257 .
we all love baseball , right ?
somehow , the kids don &apos;t do it anymore .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
they become free in the computer .
because does anybody have masses ?
and then to reconcile it .
among other things , things shouldn &apos;t suffer .
this has the biggest impact .
the reasons to write it .
anyway , not to navigate .
and that &apos;s pretty much in the beginning .
the truth is more like this .
do you want jeans with holes ?
so you can &apos;t do anything .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
her family gathered .
thank you very much for your patience .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
what else is risky ?
be simple who you are .
i remember my first fire .
what does a story mean ?
dark . dark . dark .
i was trying to do something more exciting .
but very much and effective , yes ?
but we need the total .
nulleversions , yes ?
that &apos;s completely inbelgious .
let &apos;s leave that quiet .
hmmm , my brand ?
that &apos;s frightening .
that sounds scary .
next : nuclear energy .
also a very exciting phenomenon .
i wanted to be normal at the time .
this is what i &apos;m going to show you now .
as soon as the judge saw me .
we can &apos;t just do that .
so i went to the court .
i got something scared of technology .
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
and there are several reasons for this .
they sell certificates .
but it &apos;s not documented .
why am i going to medicine ?
it can know where we are .
she spreads out of race .
all adults were aware of the risks .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i like things that are different .
i went to prison -- hard .
that didn &apos;t make sense of my eyes .
this is a child game , right ?
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
and this video is in real time .
the game begins -- swimming .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
what about longevity ?
they &apos;re just better than reality .
so the correlation is lower .
so , see what happens .
it was really changed the dynamics .
so i just started to play .
and then we said , okay .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
i &apos;m going to shoot something through the head .
have you been neither disgusting ?
that &apos;s how to learn fights .
because for me , it means memory .
how and what did he recommend ?
we say in germany , sustainability .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
music is medicine . music changes us .
it turns out to be really difficult .
and you know what i learned ?
these will be unresilient .
but what will happen in the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
this has nothing to do with science .
and that can make a big difference .
but there &apos;s another reason .
anyway , we need a solution .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
thank you very much . thank you very much .
they flew the channels .
maybe two percent .
we started with this 15 years ago .
how far do you get there ?
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
you know what neither is ?
so the first step to a interpretation .
and still it &apos;s not a interpretation .
that has to be the aging difference .
if you come to that , yes ?
you can show me , i was there .
that &apos;s just the minimum .
we can win our nutrients .
somebody knows what three seconds are ?
on the book , and on the picture .
this image reminded me of something .
i find them off .
sunlight and co2 is a method .
but perhaps this is not the case .
and what does this mean for the designer ?
i want to prove that to you .
it was a pretty destiny project .
here he leaves the sun .
this is the memory .
these rivers are going to be riding .
a has these benefits and risks .
our newspapers are read by millions .
lego made it possible for everyone .
privacy is not the debate .
they were genetically erased .
i &apos;m the new doctor .
i don &apos;t take the same lost .
baseball is full of great statistics .
because we live on a water planet .
do we really want to go into this direction ?
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
and these are the neural structures .
they didn &apos;t give the government .
oh , my time is over ?
there &apos;s something coming into me .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
so we measured his movement .
this is a picture of the object .
it was pretty popular .
you see something fun here .
i really like beautiful clothes .
he can only use his eyes .
but the truth is far away from it .
you can do that all the time .
so this crazy story could be true .
who would ever have a wish ?
the dutch would have been too simple .
her father died shortly after her birth .
for a year , we had no cents .
we have to increase complexity slowly .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
here &apos;s her marrow curve .
it &apos;s the experience of experience .
but then they really want to go into it .
you want to be oriented in the museum ?
that was more to concrete .
okay , you really want to know that ?
and i had to go out of the city .
we won some prices .
who doesn &apos;t want to change kids ?
it makes people cheese .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
no , i mean it really serious .
i think that &apos;s my hand in my hand .
and the goal is very simple .
i shoot my era back .
architects and engineers , for happiness .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
now i see greg &apos;s moon .
a billion people will be hungry today .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
i loved this fish .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and this sounds very different than before .
he was already over sixth .
i started a institute .
they even get funding with funding .
the movie hasn &apos;t been done yet .
we need to think about what marks are .
what do you do with that ? &quot;
i call this the chunky .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
this is ideology , not science .
and that made me through that one another .
today , 6.8 billion people are living .
it &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s going to come .
it &apos;s busy .
the hot projections today .
automatically goes to the right idea .
that &apos;s how the natural things are .
but it requires a lot of planning .
we can reinvent everything again .
as we think of north .
and it depends on phosphorus .
often again , again , again , forget .
it &apos;s longer than these other networks .
the stones are colored .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
it &apos;s about changing values .
i started with my usual talk .
this is a very sensitive question .
i learned this from my grandmother .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
we haven &apos;t written this app .
and every morning i jump to that .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
this is more than a thousand tomorrow .
the errors are very good .
what would you describe ?
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
there are also worlds of worlds .
to ask , what &apos;s the right ?
people are talking about the urges .
i don &apos;t know who knows what .
the living gestures are the spirits .
they gave their blood pressure up .
thank you , but the best is coming .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
happy productivity . fantastic !
the result of that was disaster hal .
and everyone in this room needs to be in .
here &apos;s the oveness oil .
bjim sins .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
risk is not a simple game .
in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
i think there are possibilities everywhere .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
we have a lot of procedure .
this is perhaps being transmitted .
my brother started me .
this is the apple saras .
i talked a lot about magic .
who would have been able to look at everything ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who do you actually want to inform ?
completely on a particular goal .
what do you think happens next ?
they have them . they always have them .
so this is a hardest thing .
it &apos;s constant .
they literally put the heel .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
most of all , when he died .
so there are two circles of circles .
the side of the product is clean water .
that sounds very unusual .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you always lose rare animals .
she &apos;s going to touch it .
he died by the story .
here you see how the building works .
they went through each other .
tell you what you feel .
the other one had died .
let &apos;s do a little intersection .
here you have this little mechanism .
there he was gathering .
the interested in making fire care .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
students will divide grades after grades .
these things are logically correct .
and here you feel it .
for energy , i noticed this one .
i tried to understand them .
all of these generations need just a few milliseconds .
and there &apos;s no one seems to rain .
that i wrote these crazy things .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
this is also a paradigm shift .
a dalmatintiner , right .
you look at the front of the back .
so from modern society .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
we need to get too far , and very quickly .
it &apos;s about a new supply of america .
they &apos;re all involved questions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they &apos;re the home countries of somebody .
we go through initiational rituals .
now look at this curve .
withird skills just belong to our lives .
i stayed people in death .
they were inspired to be inspired by it .
leaders may be a few mutations .
so scott gets this anesthesia .
we worked until late late in the night .
so i followed my building .
he moved back to silence .
now we saw the reverse effect .
so , you have all the audiences .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
... so , not so optimistic .
he switches the tips .
let &apos;s start with the real thing .
it stepped 2.7 billion dollars .
they had a concept of blue blood .
i believed that everybody could do that .
i never met him personally .
even cats look at this video .
there was jimmy kimmigrants .
let &apos;s think about atoms .
how do you describe your brand ?
we &apos;re talking about kitchen , fresh .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
no , that was what i thought .
i &apos;m a speaker person .
that &apos;s not the route .
this is a painting of a circle .
the roof was also covered with water .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
and women argued the successful .
we can support them to be good .
look at what she does .
the main man winds me .
sexually reproduction is going to the picture .
i read you the invitation .
this is &quot; the world without oil . &quot;
that &apos;s the truth . i think .
we &apos;re talking about twenty of them .
it was really unprofound .
he shaped his head , no .
this is going to happen in april in april .
we also got very accurate data .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
the mechanism comes from the gap .
but with the right design , please .
we can support them to be good .
just to say , what &apos;s information ?
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
there was never been a time like this .
and even lomborg thinks about it .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what then ?
also , these sources are underlying .
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
this is an ecological network .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
the chef had coded him .
you put it in the box .
this is such a tragic part .
which has just been represented .
what takes five million-dollar seconds ?
i see the dalmatiner .
it might take , until it &apos;s invited .
maybe you have to look at it again .
no , no , far away .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
156 nations send our television channel .
they called their internet connection .
but today we are far beyond that .
she was not drunk yet .
i &apos;m a human . i do error .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
but i was continuing to these questions .
and that was what i felt .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
what are these three billion people going to join ?
you also want to give you some wishes .
something very strange is happening here .
and that was the outbreak of the war .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
it can know how we hold it .
so it creates a feedback recovery .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
this is a humble little app .
the ufer comes from another place .
&quot; they didn &apos;t leave them . &quot;
i lived in parallel worlds .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and i &apos;d like to read the lectures .
there &apos;s another aspect in history .
you can be logically and intuitive .
tell me a little bit about this part .
make it possible -- all of you here .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
does anybody even know what this is ?
so this is the reason for this project .
it &apos;s called &quot; i jump with me . &quot;
let me tell you a little bit about it .
in fact , these kinds of ways , we don &apos;t exist .
we &apos;re still coming back to these people .
we can get ourselves like this .
so the first exciting was primat .
and there &apos;s hesive staff .
daniel kahneman : sure .
everybody would like to make people happier .
also , the domain is a role .
and why ? biologically changed food .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
we now have masses in this country now .
not the truth will be free .
because now you can apply a three-sentence .
you &apos;re going to see the timeline .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
thank you , danny kahman .
we get an absolutely flat line line .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
because we don &apos;t want to shoot around ?
we don &apos;t want companies .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
they make the process , they understand him .
there &apos;s a lot that needs to come together .
and what do you do with the waste ?
bad ? i was completely confused .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and then he can run away from this .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
his personal versions of searchy .
i &apos;m trying to make this a bit more unprecedented .
that &apos;s what he has to do as an present .
but we start to see a change .
this is an annual river .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
it &apos;s a little virus killing bacteria .
now this level of intuition is going to be very important .
so littlegendary open source .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
they grow five centimeters .
maybe i did it with guest reason .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
now let &apos;s get something else out .
it &apos;s all from our own bags .
normal people are not accessible . &quot;
as an artist , the relationship is very important to me .
here you see roberto dance .
and no matter , italy won the end .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
but the game is a formula .
thank you . i have a question to you .
he had 20 minutes of music .
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
that &apos;s just an insurance method .
it should contain the two elements .
shake the environment , make less waste .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to talk about again .
yes . it doesn &apos;t make anything else .
the goal of the film is transparency .
a language is the expression of human mind .
it was an acute barrier .
what you need is a new medical culture .
alone , shy and support without support .
do you want to come and listen and listen ? &quot;
i think our identity is threatened .
many of my mandarers are very young .
my cousins around everywhere .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic representations .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
here are two different jets .
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i have him on my laptop here . &quot;
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
a whole cool pip food .
the difference is then perceived as loss .
in two hours , they rebuild everywhere .
the emergency room moved all the strands .
no insurance can create queues .
there &apos;s a lot of great books to this topic .
so this was a problem for supercomputer .
this country is different from 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
you can predict that . why is that ?
for what exceptions i do ?
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
isn &apos;t it enough or a quarter ? &quot;
so what can we end up with all this ?
so basically , a translation of translation .
no tree is carbon neutral .
and further , now look at him .
now the next step was happening in this communities .
he had invited a lot of natural videos .
this is just the labor of labor .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so , it &apos;s here . right .
that really causes the fuel problem .
and ecologist was a disaster .
this is a part of her .
it just didn &apos;t come before , you know ?
in other areas -- the world of communication .
this is my supermarket . no big .
but western governments also help themselves .
sleep is ubiquitous .
i &apos;m going to be tired of how we all .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
if you burn coal , no .
they say there &apos;s no prediction .
can you play them in blue ?
no , we find what &apos;s in there .
and there &apos;s a central point in it .
you know , everybody &apos;s got a cake .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
now , what are the archaic models ?
and the list can be more advanced .
so that was my primary motivation .
providing america . find more .
and the problem isn &apos;t the technology .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we asked them , and nobody knew it .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
monday : color is something full of power .
it &apos;s made us shrinking .
and then it looks like this .
do you remember the winds ?
so , help me a little bit .
imagine mozart efficient .
i &apos;m happy that i &apos;m there .
the water amounts have increased .
they worry about the bad thing .
man 3 : i &apos;m the shame guy .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a lit box .
in between , the instruments have evolved .
i want to explain this just a little bit about a minute .
in fact , no viral video wanted to make a viral video .
in this three-sentence , three sentences come from .
thirty-three sentence you &apos;re still from school .
you can zoom in and zoom out .
now i add a bass to it .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
if not , jellyle someone else today .
this is the machine underneath the gene .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
they laughed more than they do here .
your problem is you have too little .
third : escalation of expectations .
the official dogma of what ?
you just stop talking and then start talking .
let me show you how they work .
it &apos;s a game called the following .
i call them &quot; the income billion . &quot;
we &apos;re thinking about energy needles today .
it &apos;s about it . thank you .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
you go around and you get amed .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
imagine an airplane full of rings .
that &apos;s what &apos;s built in the city .
second half-time . the normal game time .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
imagine that just for a moment .
raise your hands . let me see .
maybe we can see a change as change .
dumb is not much better .
people suffered . people fighting .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
you know that science is not a company .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so , that really got me around .
i tried to preserve the body .
life had not changed since centuries .
but so many of the years of aid .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
my fourth technique : predictions for complexity .
the third technique : categorization .
it takes a thousand square miles .
you come to two because of them -- very simple .
you &apos;re supposed to tell me something about my brand .
it was something that we knew .
but reality is always unpredictable .
the summer was a happy summer summer -- 2006 .
donnership : self-confidence is the key .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
i wanted to restore health after a disease .
now , if you think about a little bit further .
what ? that really made me flip .
we &apos;re changing nutrients of nutritional food .
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
we forced them . puff .
my parents are the 80 on the ferences .
and there &apos;s the latin problem .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drinking information . &quot;
they can jump directly to a certain exception .
you can go into a particular year .
because that &apos;s because it &apos;s lighting , right ?
shake the environment , it needs less energy .
that &apos;s what &apos;s called the osit model .
now you can see the dalmatiner .
and the two previous ones are here today .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
this has to go down , down to zero .
but i didn &apos;t get out of it .
it &apos;s great , but i was love .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
and in time , you can react other things .
our goal was to just say , okay .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go back again .
everything is compatible .
it &apos;s everything in it , it &apos;s useful .
this is being exposed in china in a second .
the phosphorus problem is a lot critical .
anyway , they do that in the middle .
the permanent ice is marched with red .
and if not , dance still is your dance .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
my mother asked us to touch their hand .
seriously -- the bottom line !
well , this cartoon does some of the things .
here &apos;s a few on the hamplet .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
i thought i could integrate myself .
we still think they &apos;re originally original .
the three words said , do you remember ?
i remember it was yesterday .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
well , i checked the court .
i said , &quot; ok , oma . &quot;
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition .
i work in the solar industry .
and let me show you a simple example .
but it has an unexpected waste .
so that made sense , it would be fit together .
yet , we seem to be very satisfied with it .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
scott entertained from human being to human .
and here &apos;s a very good piece of gear .
after that , it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
is it about the details or the colors ?
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
no one has to give up ideas .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
i think maybe i &apos;ve heard more hands .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
eee ! no , thank you .
and this is a million-dollar concern .
so this is where we need digital security systems .
so again , the appropriate really well together .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
internality comes in many different forms .
so they sit down ; they save the shoes .
that &apos;s about a percent of the population .
we &apos;ve been here for 130,000 years .
what we want to do is create the future .
i don &apos;t get the real life of this feedback .
there &apos;s a lot of happy coaching .
so let me show you from here .
it &apos;s kind of like a potatoon .
damaged . damaged .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
they were just like the people in this room .
my grandparents got this number 70 .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
we need to be able to use for more research .
there &apos;s every footprint .
i would normally take the needle out .
there &apos;s somebody sitting in there who had no childhood .
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we would do this as we had a machine here .
what do you think about these design students ?
this is going to be a key element of this believer .
they live with chemosynthesis .
i was totally excited about knowledge , you know .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
and every night they fly 240 miles back .
every morning they fly 240 miles to farm .
how is the fueling ? &quot;
natural light then offers smartly .
no one has done that in the world .
picasso is answering them only .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
that the theme of ecology is a global scale .
now i &apos;m going to do something else about it .
they &apos;re all back to their way back .
and they had to remove what we did .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we just signed down .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
so you can &apos;t put them wrong .
what do you do with certificate ?
this is alfred gonzalez .
there can be a sequence of changes .
and this is very important in medical research .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for this .
what would you tell someone who believes this ?
then he flipped me into the ear .
the rest of the time , they &apos;re deleted .
i start with some simple examples .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
the question is why people accept that .
and i went back to work .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silicon .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
then i wonder : how could that happen ?
first , i thought that this would be a game .
the storytelling always takes more senses .
and trying to do that again with another generation .
today , a lot of people have given the government .
the next week is coming down to the market .
it has a button , it has a button .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the process .
the first is a classic , apple .
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
these things have a positive effect .
none wanted to do something with the film .
what do you think the answer will be ?
on the left , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s why i think we need to be leadership .
so we have this terrible idea .
so two pairs , every baby .
ladies and gentlemen , their relations .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
it was hunting beyond the imagination .
but the best thing is -- in one second .
so every concert is a different concert .
so not saving , avoid , avoid .
and everything is packaged or content .
i could get right in front of my house . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
they support other mistakes when they talk about their mistakes .
i put them and made me care of the treatment .
do you know how to call a 4,000-year-old ?
notice two things about this curve .
and i have to say , there was power .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
at 16 , i started to illustrate books .
that our contribution to the system is vote .
there had to be another piece of puzzles .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
he &apos;s not coming out in other countries .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
i never want to change something more different in life .
so i spoke a few months later at a conference .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- they walk along their fingers .
i want to show you something here .
and then , of course , it made click .
it was summer , and i had repts .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
and they &apos;re not just going to die of masses .
what happened is that we could do that .
they don &apos;t spend time in power .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . i put on .
these are absolutely logical and correct .
anyway . that &apos;s what i want to do every case .
technical circles are just the same thing .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for nine .
i put it in particular .
at the beginning , the tribal society is through language .
compassionate , dance with me . thank you very much .
so she &apos;s supposed to come from people to the outside .
we don &apos;t make identity , we invent them .
it was much less , and i was in eggs .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
now everyone is trying to see something out of this pattern .
he came to me and hugged me .
all of them were so , they started sharing .
but it &apos;s definitely not a optimal situation .
do i &apos;m really sorry . do you do that crazy ?
the country would roll up to them .
so smartly , a giant topic everywhere .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
we want something against the death penalty companies .
there &apos;s a couple of interesting developments .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet , a realistic level is a realistic level .
so the theme of the day : financial saving .
in fact , no , that was not the mistake at all .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
and we need to improve a lot more on this device .
it was formed four and a half years ago in italy .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
this is a problem that many players have .
the last three of the five i &apos;ve been summarized .
let &apos;s just look at the ecological model .
memory goes down , lions the rest .
and that &apos;s what these marks did .
well , what &apos;s the marke gerry ?
i want to help you to calm .
both of them are survival , both of them .
as i said , amanda asks our elephants .
there were no canal peouts .
do you have taken all your vitamine tomorrow ?
so that was a very strange experience .
i can &apos;t do it , but this guy can .
we have 20 percent in germany .
all of these windmills are all over the place .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
the only thing they had was their head .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
this is a dead turtle .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
i have something that i want to show you .
how would it be longer to live in good health ?
we don &apos;t want companies to patent life .
and i found this incredibly exciting .
they have reverse the flow of the water .
so , we can &apos;t help these things .
in the countries where people come to money .
and what does it look like in there ?
we understood that the weather is global .
and in this head , the memory played down .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is a completely unsustainable development pattern .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
everyone in my home neighborhood is gone .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
well , would you choose the same vacation ?
there seems to be an imperative .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
now they understood the advantage of &quot; prototyping . &quot;
this is the u.s. for hundreds of years .
i think the first place is the curiosity .
the floors eat the shrimp .
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
but maybe you can see them again .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
not everything should be compatible .
if you love in somebody , efficient ?
and we see that it &apos;s coming through .
because it doesn &apos;t feel effective for us .
yeah , so what should be biohacking ?
here &apos;s a few people who test it .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
there are the ones that are much more resilient .
the headquarters is right here .
i thought he would have kidney stones .
and feedback on my top of my top doctor .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
we want the number of crops .
the swiss is oilty .
that was an interesting step of dna .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
but what happens to &quot; shoot &quot; is different .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the eticket .
no apple ever shrugged again .
good night , sweet threshold . &quot;
now he gets a tractor into the scene .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements , and they &apos;re insane .
if your job is dance , dance .
so we made about 50 of the magnets .
these are images about a thumb of six seconds .
but let &apos;s not always be such a bad thing .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
they &apos;re going to be rare because we &apos;re going to catch them .
so you don &apos;t pretend to do a lot of these animals .
all of these things are inevitably inevitable .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
i remember if it was yesterday .
and i &apos;m going to be a character in the book .
sag , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
so each of them was a little different .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
i put my job at 95 .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
we found that it &apos;s really weird .
they wanted to do absolutely nothing to do with the project .
the answer will probably be &quot; no . &quot;
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
because otherwise , our problem is even bigger .
this is something like our fight .
so you can pull the whole movement .
here are the results that we &apos;ve just got .
but how do you do that in practice ?
and it &apos;s not just about gender .
i want to do it by not being stered . &quot;
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
that &apos;s not how happy a person lives .
and they ask : what happens to these moments ?
... also , the doses play a role .
probably many of you in the room are familiar with this trick .
yes , they &apos;re right . we &apos;re going to fix that .
and i &apos;ve got all kinds of little props here .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
well , i understand that . i do that .
the marshmallow has to be up on the top .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
these blocks don &apos;t make us a money .
i can reverse the sequence while it &apos;s going .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
for nathaniel , music is soul health .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
because in fact , this man is not interested in prove .
because we can &apos;t live this lifespan without life .
he just fails her and not himself .
why do i have to afford this little car ?
a phrase with his own breath .
over interpretation of interpretation , barely is spoken in class .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
it &apos;s kind of a biope .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
or they didn &apos;t have a pie gray gray .
and that leads us to the one big question ...
they virtual reality the reality , and without computers .
yes , what do we do now ?
and the world we lived in was this .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
if you put it together , this is what happens .
and that wasn &apos;t hard to diagnose diagnosis .
i was a forced obsessive student .
good , really good , maybe a all-star star .
empathy , not debt , affects the outcome .
she had the last word in every family argument .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we &apos;re using this word with such versions .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and that worked . applause for scott .
i met the decision to pull in the united states .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
in 2010 , there was 23 million times .
and that was an experience in decourage for me .
and finally , we should come up with transparency .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
or are they more download ?
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
so what are we going to see in the movie ?
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
i want to tell you how we found that .
and this is the planning behind the stuxy .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
every polberg has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
look , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
it &apos;s natnatocracy , it &apos;s just natocracy .
we have the passion of a diy innovators .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
we want to create mass infections . &quot;
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
now we &apos;re doing this with drill and machines .
this is the call center for service and information .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
we have all navigation systems in our cars .
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , let me show you a little bit more about it .
here we were , and this is the painting .
emc presents &quot; use transparency . &quot;
there was a lot of crazy things going on .
from the bird age to the machine age of machine age .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same with disabled movement .
but are we going to make the best of our game ?
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
you expect an extra billion player in the next decade .
but one of them is worse than the other .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
i thought we &apos;re going to bring the pot up .
there is a connection that creates each other respect .
and so i then met a slightly unusual decision .
so , my two passions were kind of going on .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
i don &apos;t know who knows this picture .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
it seems to me that it seems to be both .
the question of death row is an interesting question .
the kid in me is really excited about this opportunity .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamics .
al is a hydrant in boston town .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
the underwater part comes from a stone breakdown .
when i say reality , i &apos;m talking about reality .
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
and how was that for you ? what &apos;s it successful ?
a little bit more about you , that &apos;s not you .
it was &quot; forever , forever . &quot;
tuesday : adapting adaptations will be completely overwhelmed .
the dog ! i was linguistic .
do you want to be more attractive and self-conscious ?
she did hardly and was blue .
the people in the side are now coming in .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and some of them didn &apos;t work and manner .
so we &apos;re going to run away , and where are we going ?
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
we wanted to develop a learning tool for language learning .
i may have another 40 years of work .
you know what the answer to this question is ?
if you want to create hyper-left left left between the images .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not perceived as big loss .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
this is the kind of teachers &apos; kind of richer .
and fortunately , there &apos;s also a whole lot of studies .
so we learn trust and the rules of the game .
probably one of those numbers has to get very close to zero .
and i said , &quot; yes , very much . &quot;
you can say things that have impact around the world .
... could you just show the slide .
just like , i think we &apos;re going to play games today .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the aid doctor .
and i went over and i just heard .
it also shows in other places of the book .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
another favorite image of me , star night .
these results were achieved by several weeks of hard work .
this player is just a episode of an episode .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
there &apos;s a program that might be familiar with some of them .
i &apos;m very grateful for the recommend here .
you know that he was 1835 here .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of it yet .
my mother litt lifts from the boat .
these are the people who shape my view .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the border .
we see this in all sorts of areas of human life .
and it was just after the three months .
it &apos;s right , morality , patch .
the main problem here is like aids .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell you about reality .
it &apos;s a nice example of it .
then i say , heart beige , yes ?
and we can invent ourselves as much as we want .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re going to bring kids to the world .
his whole employment has changed after that .
i said , &quot; forgive , oma . &quot;
it &apos;s inverted and strange programs .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
but that , what this picture is , is a problem .
there are some places that we can apply to .
we called it the digital water of civil coulion .
because they have special skills of processing .
so here &apos;s a couple of natural fireflies .
the second factor are the services that we use .
this changed my way to make movies completely .
it &apos;s hard to overcome the destruction .
so you could feel like you could sell him .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
that means that the ants weigh much more than us .
and we can now look at this .
geh and jellyard cows .
so , raise them and start inventing them .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
imagine only two other little changes .
how many would you decide for a good memory ?
and this is the message of the message .
so please listen , if a music is played .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what &apos;s true .
the first two sentences that are logically correct .
in fact , we know that something else is the case .
now this should actually be a joke , but it &apos;s not a joke .
do that once , and then you experience the sentence .
we can do these things in different examples .
what we love is , it &apos;s a mystery .
they moved to a natural concept .
so these women met , and they just got up .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and we designed an ipad app .
dars and sponsors were healthy .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzles .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you zoom in . you can actually go into it .
you can see in all these mulakes here .
how much money is needed to reconcile that ?
think about it . this attack is generic .
and if it doesn &apos;t , it doesn &apos;t do anything .
so we start with a windy drug .
he says , &quot; go to the proust . &quot;
imagine a soundscape airplane .
it &apos;s a completely denial of error .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to develop ourselves .
this is another look at the tree of life .
they divided the kingdom in two .
this is one of the classical expressions in playing .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
we had no child paralysis yesterday .
and i &apos;ve been using a while to figure that out .
we repeated this practice with the same students .
you have to be ready to take those risks up .
&quot; look at your legs , pink .
there &apos;s no population problem of trees .
then you &apos;ll notice that it has a change .
and the third area that actually explains itself .
i &apos;m happy to talk to you .
every big picture is the beginning of a dinner .
you wouldn &apos;t be hungry , and you know what ?
or are they more like a downlover ?
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
that &apos;s the consequence that we need to do .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
wednesday : kill your inner child .
play is the tickle that keeps us .
if you have to give something , you give it a little bit .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re right now ?
they teach them to open up themselves .
antony : healthy , strong , strong , powerful . &quot;
and here are two patients . these are their records .
i mean , this is a real cognitive piano .
i think that &apos;s true for everyone on the planet .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
so , a climate change will be terrible for you .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
it grows in winter and rubber in summer .
not just bad , but the worst of all times .
everybody knew her genius was something worthy .
we repair them , repair them .
and the world we &apos;re now looking like this .
but these are all roads in the u.s.a .
we dance in the temple and we become god . &quot;
child mortality has declined for a tenth .
that &apos;s also where it comes back .
maniok , something that &apos;s half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s not an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
we walk into the arms of the placebo industry .
in nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
where is the largest interest in doing that ?
also , the energy curve is very important for you .
we went back to the shock of titanic .
because artists have a local relationship to lie .
and at all , you work a lot less than me .
or b , because you don &apos;t have learned to sing ?
i will never play as much as in this moment .
it &apos;s the form of real behavior , yes ?
and less usable or user &apos;s friendly , it &apos;s .
how can i do something to use friendly ?
i don &apos;t see any reason why that should not be that .
so how do we work if we put in there ?
every society is preferred by a primarily media .
and these interactive portraits are looking at each other .
we &apos;re now focusing on fuel generation .
you may have heard that we built watersigns .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
you get a model that comes out of the earth .
the grandfather of this old manner refused .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
the only problem with that was that she had 10 children .
so in other words , i first want to define what i want .
and i see the same process in combination of photos .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it became almost 200 million times a year .
they had 348 different kinds of marks .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
he described one of them as a very usual .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
in a place , the screen goes on with leaves .
so , the pythesia movement has done it .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
this year , it was looked almost 50 million times .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
i want to talk about the problem , and about some possible solutions .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
we should put the bear in the cheese .
are you eight and monkeys like seven ?
the living self has no voice in this election .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
and in the world , everything gave me a sense of me .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
dane , in a moment of head .
you can look almost great for less than 50 dollars .
so gender can come up in many different varieties .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
and no , it &apos;s not clear or san francisco .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open them ?
here &apos;s the latest version of this contract .
it was a extreme situation . you needed a extreme solution .
and this was kind of the first of people developed toys .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
you never get a job that you can &apos;t solve .
i mean , i was rarely seen as flat lines .
i &apos;m going to take this hand . and here &apos;s knife .
and the movie is called &quot; the cycle . &quot;
well , in this area , there are not several thousand goals .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
well , we hired the mayor hole .
now , today we know everything about where our things come from .
france makes a tor . italy makes a tor .
how do you judge people because of their characteristics ?
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressive .
he stops every fifth of hope from my consciousness .
is it good for others , or does it affect us ?
so i say , let &apos;s start the world &apos;s changing games !
edward caint ova is a volcano scientist .
we spend three billion hours per week playing online .
the biggest difference between you is the transition with time .
we tried to get the point of automation .
bg : a energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
and i say , &quot; shake don &apos;t even get you .
with pivot , you can put it into a decade .
but for many people , this is a little too radical .
so , i &apos;ve carried lots of fish in my life .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
in fact , the notes are very vary and unprecedented .
because we don &apos;t make things more free .
that &apos;s where it &apos;s going to be more like my glasses .
as i said , it &apos;s just started .
this is an interactive film .
and olt : make it clear for you despite the alley .
i &apos;m still going to write on , because that &apos;s my job .
and everybody knew it was working , right ?
i would rather want to do this work that i love .
and the question is , are these good news or bad news ?
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
here &apos;s , &quot; look at your fingers every single light . &quot;
the next step was to find the apps for it .
we know another one where everyone is going on .
so you &apos;re just going to google project t.com .
what other metamorsen did you walk through ?
so we don &apos;t have a budget like another brand .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look awesome .
this constant feedback is not in real life .
i &apos;m going to explain it for you , and then i &apos;ll explain it .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
a research mester about interface design .
i &apos;m also going to solve the same thing that &apos;s in there .
you don &apos;t know anything possible in this goldfish . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great dwarriors .
in the future , most crime are going to play online .
we had no words for what we started there .
now he &apos;s standing on the red list of dangerous species .
30 years ago , this might be ridiculous .
but i really believe that after us , there &apos;s something else .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of this communities .
the cell communities began to abstract information again .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital physical .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacines .
&quot; don &apos;t go , &quot; it &apos;s as untrue .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the steam .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s being put together .
urban designers and construction are very interested .
there &apos;s not even a long time . there &apos;s no extension .
so that doesn &apos;t work for the memory itself .
our steps in digital life were exponentially exponentially .
this is star night , never seen that before .
over the course of this discovery , i learned a lot .
as a kid , i was constantly drawing comic books and so .
if we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing now .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
we were only silent around the way we did .
many talk from a 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
i was quite obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
so when sound says , there &apos;s no soul .
this is the most difficult part in my talk .
i can &apos;t play as much as in 20 years .
both accidents were going to me , ask me .
so much testosterone , but no reaction to it .
so growth is accelerating itself .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my own .
1m is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
that &apos;s because of the weighs to think about .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
well , how do people die in such a hack ?
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and you can see this green point there in the middle .
i sold museum in the whole country , around the world .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can turn it around .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
no , that &apos;s exactly the right thing , yes ?
many of you are covered by faces .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
in both cases , it was operated , and it was very good .
she didn &apos;t have an infected brain damage .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
and the fish also had the fortune to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the numbers of language .
it was the errors of drugs against drugs .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
there &apos;s more still behind , it &apos;s even deeper .
but we just know a little bit about where things go .
ok , imagine how extreme self-assembly motivated .
i know what people think if you see that .
ask , ask the evidence , ask evidence , ask evidence .
i said , &quot; hut ? &quot;
everything in life is beautiful , it &apos;s not efficient .
as it was used to happen to the village in the village .
this is what &apos;s going on like the nano-engineering age .
but in our country , there &apos;s a political exception in our country .
they put them on the beatles machine .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental disorder .
she could find out within a time learning framework .
... it &apos;s the crowdsourcing .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
i &apos;ve been working in a cook station -- dangerous .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there &apos;s crammers and he said , &quot; what ? &quot;
that means that you go back to the board .
so , as a human being is about certain things .
and of course , as design is taking the sense of perception .
for the lower two billion but it &apos;s a disaster .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
anwalt : i &apos;m a lawyer .
we have a abstract abstract language .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
but in this night , it was even more fun .
we had to worry about the lawyers , etc .
it was called &quot; automatically . &quot;
wainar is a certification .
well , because you don &apos;t know that it was different .
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to do ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it be ?
it slows down for one of our big problems .
we see the process that feeds themselves from themselves .
rats ? yes . alive ? yelling .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
but they can combine something special like this .
it &apos;s really just to combine different realities .
because the images eat it for you recommend .
i mean , i think , you &apos;re in this museum .
the idea is to translate a digital security system .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i make it clear .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is great . i love the placebo industry .
in fact , the advanced society is based on energy advances .
this was not a movie , no hd , that was real .
i wasn &apos;t there a long time ago with miguel .
because you know that &apos;s a fun process .
have you ever seen a client tree ?
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i just described .
if you get too far , get together . &quot;
caring america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
happy , the carbon man will be clean every day .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
so i &apos;m going to step back and make another view .
i filmed in war -- difficult and dangerous .
so we should be better trying to figure out what the goal is .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
when we make cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
in other words , play is our adaptation joys .
can you imagine a good thing that comes out of tabak ?
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
you can just call a couple names , and people will understand .
diphantom , tuesh , child paralysis ...
this is a variation of one thing that was made .
well , the energy curve is about time .
and it was an experience that could not give me hollywood .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the movie .
it empowered jews in the control room .
that &apos;s not an advertising , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a pig .
it &apos;s this contribution , it &apos;s coated taste .
the shrimp eat the physical lankton .
and so he &apos;s flying his elaborate circumstances .
and then there &apos;s a whole lot of simulations .
but it wasn &apos;t that in the last few years .
the musical instrument is the extension of our body .
he only lived in nine-year-olds for three years .
hey , puma , do you really feel serious ?
a baby needs about a searching wind .
so i know from some who didn &apos;t wear .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone from here .
it &apos;s like asking someone to beat the sun .
please follow me , because the circle will come back again .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
this is an iconic debate . she has to stop .
they get to thabo mki in south africa .
but then i thought , you know what , we &apos;re honest .
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of thousands .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
bruno gio sani : thank you very much . thank you .
i have a friend that drives a passerati .
it &apos;s not just a nice pedal .
and because we &apos;re getting older , the wind gets bigger .
that &apos;s the time period that you love .
and we &apos;re still very , very , very strong stories .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and the predictions that they read are serious .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
and i didn &apos;t expect that to change .
it &apos;s also my great , life-life love and fascination .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
why do they get around us if we can &apos;t buy ?
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
a few years ago , i started to develop littlegendarity .
the brows still describe them as untouched .
my grandfather was during the prohibition in prison .
she was a keyboard , strong woman , she had an effect .
so , in a way , the technique refers us the technology .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
but what if you want to see the pink strikes ?
but my logical side has not liked it .
i just want to say a little bit about salaries .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . heart wish .
we also brought littles to design schools .
this is the simulation of chesapeke bay .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against injustice .
my uncle died of alcohol diseases .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
in fact , we &apos;re also a multiply community community .
what &apos;s this new condition that takes the world slowly ?
let &apos;s call it the animal , it costs a lot of money .
if another person is helping us , we strengths our communities .
ohhhh , wwwwwww !
they always worry that they lose galleries .
50 percent of their decisions were hit within nine minutes or less .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and my talk today is going to be about this cognitive action .
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often .
this is the really cool part , which is called collection .
open the map , and jump them with a click .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a whole lot about transparency .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
you could also use ordinary design -- technology to spread .
one of my friends made it -- richard bollingbird .
imagine that these dots could really start flying .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
these are the kinds of questions that we need to meet .
i was fascinated by the elephant and beauty of biology .
and i can tell you it was a changing experience .
we need to start changing the real world into a game .
and this is from an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
i mean , how much toes we memorize from our memories ?
the more you make the more money you &apos;re satisfied .
that our survival is linked every single person .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
and yes , i have a task like you might recognize .
secondly , photos should have the same lighting species .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
for example , this one would be completely logical .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute that sounds interesting . &quot;
yes , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be done .
this is me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of statements .
and the movie is going to cause the bee .
i &apos;m jori , and this is my suitcase .
just that i think it &apos;s more like him , not true .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
i hope you &apos;re looking at it . thank you very much .
but it turns out that this is not all .
i mean , we &apos;re asking ourselves , why do we fight that ?
that &apos;s a lot of tode by masses , 20 hour per hour .
so there should be better at the beginning of my death .
because they &apos;re the ones who are experts for taste .
the system is so healthy , it gets the water .
i mentioned it to miguel , and he didn &apos;t put it .
so the more paintbrush the better the system . &quot;
and then i &apos;m going to immediately , that &apos;s unfair .
and also , what you &apos;re thinking about today in mind .
and the oil we &apos;re going to replace by other energy carriage .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it clear .
like algae -- and other terrible things .
i &apos;m not going to tell you it because i want to use it .
it was completely excluded that she could fail .
so that got me right , and i wanted to get more .
and immediately , i see a different pattern that gives you .
yeah , this is a burden down there .
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , it &apos;s effective .
we &apos;ve now spent three years in holland now .
and if i can find some of the strange things .
i know now that it was the bottom of the sea .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
i studied wife printer , and she was in breathing .
and i gathered more and more knowledge .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a bat is 300 .
in 2010 , we had just connected two billion people online .
i tried to say something about our system .
and the lighting is the way through the rest of the book .
&quot; because she &apos;s been holding her tomorrow , &quot; he said .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropy .
this approach is true for everything that we do creative .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all sorts of recognition .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
well , your life itself is not going to be happier .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
here &apos;s a picture of an orange in kentucky .
he &apos;s got a forage from 15 to one .
i can tell you the canvas is a man .
we &apos;ve moved to us earlier as the bird age .
this is 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
this is the audience that we &apos;ve just done recently .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here you are .
but you can , if you &apos;re in a foreign exception .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t seem to be more human .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
or you want to be more , more powerful , more force .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though that belongs .
my great-grandparents died when they were 60 .
now , where are we going to go , what &apos;s the right approach ?
this is kind of all in the submersible phase .
and of course , it can never give them more . &quot;
one government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
and the more i talked about , the more i should tell .
and i celebrate , i like a little kid .
obviously it &apos;s not going to fit into my tiny suitcase .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re pulling other happy people .
players are in spiders in the spigot social networks .
how can we translate these feelings from the reality ?
this is how the same , bad team under the best .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worry .
so the people in the west have really thought about creativity .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
a consequence was that the telephone was never broken .
the same thing that we can tell the structure and function of function .
a few months ago , and i had just forgotten everything .
even who kills someone , is not just a murder .
the invention of language was a smaller step in this direction .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
and this video was already in january of january .
each of these issues , of course , were made of many , lots of small decisions .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing the time .
today , i want to tell you about circles and openness .
they interact with their environment and their experiences .
this trick can lead your friends and neighbors . thank you .
you know , there were no mandarins in the parades .
yes , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting about the vision .
i apologize that i have to shorter .
secondly , what economists call the economist east .
and i think this is what the world looks like .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
so it has nothing changed , and yet it changed everything .
we just got the 7-billion-dollar brand .
then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
so , if you could do the light again .
it was a store called dragger .
are you as far ? you see a little bit nervous .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
the things that are just used , go into technical systems .
so the device you can see , it doesn &apos;t work .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean technology .
they did it by making the country &apos;s greenhouse .
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
you &apos;re going to welcome the fear . you &apos;re welcome to risk .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
there &apos;s only the second best , the firefighters .
they can throw away where they go and stand .
an amazing error rate rate . one of nine innocent .
i want to give you two , maybe three examples are present .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually going to be a wheelchair of a wheelchair .
this is somebody who is safe in the rest of 10 .
we used to be used to that things happen .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black boys than manders .
they &apos;re in there , they want to go to the end of the gangs .
and then people could eat that , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
because that &apos;s where the actual government is taking place .
&quot; 2.5 to one what ? what do you feed ? &quot;
and then we started negotiating insulin .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
i understand what these daughters could mean .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re helping them , ask them to the people .
but also our perception of how to deceive it , because we are .
and other examples are the ambient , intelligent systems .
how many doors have the house in which they live ?
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s also fine .
i believe that and i feel that we should teach .
and i guess many of you have done this as well .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
i sent them home without talking to my doctor .
the cost of solar energy in the last year was 50 percent .
we need to be able to get into the machine of the government .
there &apos;s a direct return to the director of this .
the use of software takes a couple of years .
and sure , we can find fast-foods .
cats look at cats that look at this video .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
and what happened was that i needed a experts .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned language language .
i just wish i could see my kids grow up .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
it has moments of life , one after the other .
and i survived them to fund a expedition .
we &apos;re talking about the fluctuation of information transit .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering collective .
that &apos;s the first year in the first year of his advertising .
well , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
so they &apos;re moving around and doing art installations like this .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you &apos;ve got to protect it . &quot;
i was shocked and moved into the inside .
i went through the emergency division on my way home .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
i say that because i think identity is very important .
because all of these new technologies today are feeding themselves from themselves .
because your life was depending on whether they did the job right .
and these people know what we lost from the eyes .
i knew she had been there to give up .
today we don &apos;t just find the gene that we &apos;re doing .
a typical wal-mart offers you today 100,000 products .
do you know how many decisions do you meet in a typical week ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you is what truly amazing .
in the previous example , it was about finding details .
he said he didn &apos;t say that . he &apos;s going to ask .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i &apos;ve done .
if you didn &apos;t move anymore , you &apos;ve got them buried .
wouldn &apos;t they want to make these changes in their genes ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
again , what potential would we want to call the potential ?
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own episode game .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of reasons for two reasons .
when we looked at us , how feelings with income .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
there was no christmas trees . we did it all .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is mimic .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
depending on a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not sure .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the photograph actually was put together .
the words , as long as his friends , spotted his face .
and we found that in fact , there was a context .
do you know how many decisions do you do on a typical day ?
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
so the driving force behind is the cybersuperpower .
i didn &apos;t give me two years more with my wife .
the pilot made the machine after the hudson river .
the openness is that death is a part of life .
it keeps us from distance , and it keeps us to evolve .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
it &apos;s about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
you see the person who asks to what happens inside .
most of my activities , i have two hips .
it turns out that dna synthesization is very difficult .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we think about our future as an unbelievable memory .
well , the memory itself is a storyteller .
what it was ruined was the memories of experience .
we &apos;re going to meet ourselves in the next few days .
there &apos;s a six--for-care admission there .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
a fish , but also a bird reserve .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love story .
this first , that was more like a passionate monkey .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s caught it .
because the music is a language and a language is communicated to communicate .
and , first of all , to ask , what &apos;s the right thing .
but i &apos;ll just make it a little bit curious .
i started thinking , i should just put this into the project .
we can , of course , first of course , the waste problem .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of platform .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take you away .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
just to precise timetrics , they &apos;re overwhelmed .
when the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
so you can ask : how happy is that alive itself ?
most of you are completely ignored by the memory itself .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
has one single person in the audience ever die of masses ?
it turns out that you can get that on zero .
you can test it after my talk in your tent .
but , of course , the sum is very , very many ideas .
and she asked him , what &apos;s your hobbies ?
so that , in every store , you can get the things back .
so the question is , how do we deal with these windmills ?
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
so , for example , shame the environment , less car .
and life lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
so if i put them together side by side , their interest is to interest .
can i look like this as if i could just write a song ?
she said it would be like a donation of the air .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
and they say , &quot; doc , what should i do ? &quot;
they put a blue blue on a green , and they can make light .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
these images are extraordinary because the transition goes very quickly .
yet , we still come to the gdp islands .
more and more people came in , just because they were angry .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
we have a lot of cells that are not on themselves alone .
you make the mistake now , and you pay very much a lot later .
and what &apos;s below is what we call bureaucracy .
but where would the next aed to help this patient ?
they have to make 62 different decisions to design their car completely .
well , don &apos;t get me wrong , it wasn &apos;t just that easy .
almost as we were going to be prepared for our lives for a long time .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego space .
i was the only one who could talk to the aircraft .
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
think of this as a point , as a flying point .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
this is a fascinating adventure on which you go .
this is going to affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
we found this in terms of happiness itself .
they dark their judgments . more they never do .
usually most people start to be oriented by the task .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
if you walk , yes , every footprint the ground .
if we can translate it , we can shake a little bit back .
the most powerful mindset is the head of massey palm .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
there &apos;s a magic amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a book .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to be worse .
and the motive of online criminals are very easy to understand .
because through marine protected areas , we &apos;re basically going back to the past .
i want to conclude with a story that really excited me .
sometimes i lose the equilibrium . a story to end .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
so now we &apos;ve returned the newspapers .
so today evolution can happen in the time of microseconds .
here he lifts a rare tapear .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
we could reduce that for 10 percent , but what does that ?
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
automation , outside of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
they &apos;re not coming from the mulakes .
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
i really like your kind of , sergey . well .
i became the miracle part of this day , not to die .
it &apos;s called eyebrow , and you can see the description .
this is the average size of a greenland iceberg .
i mean , what does somebody do with so many output ?
and as general term , we can use the word of sexual sexuality .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
we all need to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , he &apos;s called miguel .
because he doesn &apos;t know how to go first .
and then the same thing happens in a good conversation .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
we take pictures of this mini-big bang in detectors .
economists call this a parallel improvement .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
freedom to maximize is to maximize .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
this is a whole book , an example of non-visual data .
and of course , we all share the same adaptation .
and that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s happening in the fda of inhalar .
there are cases of us , like the inhalar of inhalar .
let me close to three of my own words : remember me .
innovation , creativity , creativity , not only come from our heads .
i want to help you a very particular aspect of curiosity .
because frankly , every project has his own marshmallow .
ceos are a little bit through average . but here &apos;s interesting .
because although it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of things .
here &apos;s one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
this deputy ran across the elderly black .
but i don &apos;t know how people will be .
you &apos;re about the block , and you &apos;re taking it as a openness .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the temple room .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees of our next living relatives .
the first of these fall is a contradiction to admit complexity .
they invest a lot of their time in the construction of the growing structures .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little people will support .
usually you &apos;re just dancing , and some people don &apos;t come .
now he mentioned the mineral needs of physical lankton .
i take the breathing of the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
they feel that &apos;s the actual truth behind the outside .
but the question that i want to throw is : why not ?
and the best thing about it is that we &apos;re supposed to be in the realm of health .
this is technology supported innovation that there are today .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
wr wants to help people who have been convicted .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
how did he come to look at this particular way to help ?
let &apos;s just jump back to moma , again in new york .
the tempt is going to be part of the show , which is pretty scary .
we produce androws , and we &apos;re talking about androgents .
and when you do it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
that &apos;s scandalable , and we should be ashamed .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple practice .
but while they talked to different people in the world about these possibilities .
they have a renewable energy percentage of fifte-percent .
and they did this with the so-called lead-maps .
but crucial is when i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so i &apos;ve been busy , when is , of course , or intuitive .
and this is just the biohacker , the individual people .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to the scientific .
this struck me when i wanted to delete my jeans .
he invited the king of sidewalk to dinner .
but somehow we &apos;re creating it from this problem .
and that &apos;s what i had last year .
but instead of asking in panik , he just stopped .
how about tears that we can &apos;t even predict ?
if you look at the people they have to do it ...
and guess what we found in the angular code ?
imagine that every single one of people is controlled by people .
okay , let me make a little blood for you .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
new investments to create good functions .
six of them : social waste . seven deaths : 65 deaths .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design these kinds of games and play .
that means that the players are safe by 10 sleeps .
a long time ago , there was gray whales -- 500 years ago .
so many of you will say , these are crazy ! that &apos;s good .
the x interpretation of the interpretation is this comparable .
from my eye angle , i saw the janitor and i went down .
light worms in a glass , i always found very exciting .
for example , this image has about 10 billion points , i think .
so i decided that when i was 15 , diving .
here i &apos;m getting a little bit bigger . we &apos;re looking at the center here .
and within less years , lego moved into every household .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
by the way , i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a lawyer .
and i want to show you my output for this week .
56 percent of all violent cases don &apos;t come from court .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-assembly .
i asked him how he became a fish experts .
there was the core research facilitatovirus shaped .
from this time , an anecdote that you might know .
it doesn &apos;t need to whistle a limb or singing .
and six million seconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that goes much further back in the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
so i think it &apos;s a very drunk of my mind .
i think , kind of , shrimp , or something .
this actually has just taken a thousand two really simple form , this networks .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
so this looks like a basketball plaff .
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i didn &apos;t leave me down .
well , in fact , the number of violence has not changed very much .
i used it first in a restaurant in southern spain .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity .
it was always so inspiring , so refugee .
death penalty in america is defined by irrigation .
turn the tickton on the side . went home .
alone this airport has a surface of 100 square miles .
i like things that are special . i like special things .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
so maybe you should go to the interview a little bit of this . &quot;
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leaders .
here &apos;s a cut from this angular code .
we have his bed , so he can see it outside .
we degraded a human being that has value for our society .
we &apos;re going to play a game to get the suffering of the real world .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
what about child paralysis ? take that . why not ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : it &apos;s .
the secret is that the game of the key to those skills is made .
this is actually the real estate of human and machine .
a few . probably as many as there are creative people here .
that &apos;s really my skin . that &apos;s not a special effect of hollywood .
they produced the highest constructural construction in the least time .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons of sound on the planet .
i grew up with a higher portion of science fiction .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building scv , not intensive .
so finally , there was a company trying to do it right .
the component is becoming more and more to the friend that you live together .
and i &apos;m not sure that they really remain .
the interesting thing is , if i can make a little trip .
there was , i think , a very good code .
in fact , nasa has shown that there are many of them out there .
they like the paralysis and the satisfaction of happiness .
well , i wondered how can i get this really overwhelmed ?
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all the minerals .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view .
somebody was broken , and had founded the system .
photographs like this : a building up along a lot of vehicles .
the biggest fear was they had rape , rape and death .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to get all this extension .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange street .
but of course , it &apos;s a very good medieval opportunity .
i brought seven underpants , and this is all .
but a lot of people start in a very strange position .
our gut is a wonderful friendly environment for these bacteria .
well , the two species of self throw two terms of happiness from happiness .
well , life itself lives its life continuously .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness under researchers .
it &apos;s just a bloody calm . it &apos;s mimimics .
the modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
ah , the majority . i like to see that as a doctor .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s 2,500 years back .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
now , what did this do with the placebo effect ?
the smallpox . the pox have killed billions of people on this planet .
it &apos;s the renewables that they &apos;re often called .
this is a fish to animate in the southern southwest corner .
because i ask how professional competent was this diagnosis ?
the notides have the function of the letters of a writing .
and then these are linked influences of the pre-industrial cultures .
that means you navigate over sound and over rhythm .
so that &apos;s just a application of many that you can do with it .
and then we &apos;ve been working on a cochlear .
on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to lhc .
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
this is what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
54 percent of the death penalty of death penalty .
basically , the concrete building has become the bluefin of our time .
how about a new sentence , never before voted voices .
how can a judge someone turn into something that he &apos;s not ?
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lynbs .
so programs that can make the most numerous ones .
for example , the fish had been taken on a glass trip .
possibilities that couldn &apos;t have been allowed , were encouraged .
so i did a couple of years ago to do that .
finally , we should be welcome to the fear .
an eight-time , she played marke . how is your brand ?
why is it important to start ? what does the red represents ?
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely limited by limitations .
and i said , &quot; how are you communicating ? &quot;
well , in this night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
and the critical indicator for this is the extinction of languages .
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s not this test .
and this is called androgen-receptor .
we develop ourselves to communist the heart , heart creature .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a ph.d. in study .
at the moment , they &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
and soon , i was writing an article about genetic production .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
so i started a $ 1,000 price software for the winner .
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
there was no piano at the time when the instrument was not a piano .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
even if you were to shoot now , you would have emissions .
most people know that this is from the software range .
now this is actually live in the internet . you can test it .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nineathers .
but nothing was invented to let me go back , until now .
and the best thing about it is that they connect with magnets .
some of my smartest passions have happened in the last five years .
i looked in the racks , and it was a little bit of pink .
&quot; she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular tongue .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent it home .
so the dramatic numbers come to the prisoners .
i gave some talks to germany about death penalty .
a child in india says , &quot; today i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
this is my whales wax . a very simple thing .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
what is the context of thinking and feelings about them ?
and if they &apos;re dangerous , then really bad things can happen .
and this urgency , this goal has really changed my life .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
if we &apos;re not going to take phosphorus and give them phosphorus .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the magic thing for me .
but at youtube , more than 48 hours per minute .
if you could do it for the people , they could also help me .
and just disappeared all these companies , one after the other .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned each other as adults .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one deserves us from it .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big thing .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go to the house .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
specialized skills and processing skills and their combination .
people here have contributed to the development of this miracle .
and somehow , we have to bring changes that are going to go to zero .
we &apos;re still finding other features about what their rights are .
this is the dream of most perceptions that we have .
this is our youngest taxes down there .
at the end of march , the lhc will be able to be able to work .
and this is the message i took in medical school .
do you know how to call a 3,000-foot baseball ?
i think in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
when somebody likes , it &apos;s not just a lie .
and so i think the ted community was supposed to be .
and it &apos;s spread , of course , organic , of course .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say , thank you .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
well , finally , the film has been a very large amount of time .
this is actually just a period of two / 2 weeks .
these people will be connected to the film in eternity -- forever .
so all these green areas , these are the most powerful environments .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; sins . &quot;
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of god to merge too far .
i went to the car and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
in the short period of time , one of them became clear : ted has a identity .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good proportion to actually do experiments .
in my opinion , mass infection changed our world fundamental .
this is all reality today , and in the future , it will be much more possible .
so that allows us to grow the play of binary trust , trust and each other .
here &apos;s what it says , the more you do , the better .
people said , you have no fear to succeed ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding me , but i can live with it .
and what i learned is that errors are absolutely unconstrained .
i love this one : &quot; watson offers human enemies . &quot;
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very serious .
three months later i was surrounded , and the adventure went on .
it &apos;s about creating naked goods .
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gray sounds and stuff .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
we want to use this as a possible impulse for the flyside .
and the question was : how could you connect technology to connect new technology ?
for example , i don &apos;t want to give the same rights as a human rights .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
and that &apos;s something that we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast .
i played the first sentence of beethoven concerts .
man is supposed to have the monkeys from the monkeys or a common ancestor .
according to sound and quiet , b , etc . .
how were his environment living , how are the society of society and politics ?
on september 10 . last year , the machine ran for the first time .
we &apos;ve distributed littles to kids , and they &apos;re playing with this .
and when i listened to her , she made keena sounds .
and i was good , i went down to claude .
but if i ask you a question , how about your wife ?
you collect information about the piece in the searchy literature .
there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they can all get involved .
but how would it be if the picture you connect with all your images ?
you say you &apos;re never going to be the name .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other governance technology .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
we should be able to rotate everything we want .
and i tend to see wives as my shadow .
so studies were done to see if that was true .
and then you can see what enormous speeds there are .
it comes from asia , in which all of japan comes from japan .
because a good engineer has either built great cars or nuclear power plants .
this was the very first beginning of a musical printing print .
you can only have nuclear missions if you &apos;re not there .
it &apos;s good . the question is how will we go .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
the official faith of all western industrialized societies .
&quot; do you remember the patient you got home ? &quot;
we live on a planet which is 70 percent covered with water .
they just dive the trajectory against the cities of cities .
because that &apos;s how to lie , they can just apply these logic .
often the music class is so that you just learn the notes .
that would be just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
eight : tsunami warning . nine : cyberattacks
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
just when it doesn &apos;t seem hardly to play , maybe the most tightest .
so we don &apos;t have to control people to be slightly bad .
now there &apos;s all of this rumble in front of the great revelation .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
they called yeast bits and byists that they had to attack .
it was as italy of the football world championship .
in our observations , we were in all sorts of uncomfortable areas .
and she was much worse for a than for b in the memory .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who has more lifted ? &quot;
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we make stories to tell stories .

here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not a new yorker , i apologize .
and the color daughters and shattitudes you might remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps who wrote the rock lows in the last year .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more worth building it .
they hear a lot about how quantum mechanics says everything is connected to everything .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this has been mentioned today .
that can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .
if you turn the light up , it looks like this . so just as we saw it before .
imagine if you could just look at the screen in different formats or sizes , in different solutions .
so i started thinking about what it is to do this games .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to attack the needle .
and what the marshmallow does is to identify them with hidden assumptions .
they do that because they can follow the white white line of the land street 92 .
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re somehow moved to nostie , to wonder .
and what we can read almost every day in the daytime that you find in this third sentence .
one example of this has a different area . monet has painted the erox six times .
and i want to give to protocoll that i was here for my part of the jobs here .
this was our first attempt to start with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique sound of the song , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order in which this information is represented .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true as today that it &apos;s less .
i thought , &quot; do you mean the camera would mean that we wanted a backup conversation .
so for example , the number of 164 sticks out of this code ; you can &apos;t see it .
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just so that architecture almost disappears .
if these dots fall down , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text .
our cities have become , in the last few years , with networks and electronics .
for bonobos and people , life is not made of teeth and sound alone .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and family decide .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this rotted stuff , like for example .
to be part of the constitution , it has to be approved by congress .
you put an executive administrator on the team , you &apos;re going to be better .
bill gross has several companies under another named esolar &apos;s great solar paintings .
one is the energy edition that produce these technologies are dramatically more dramatically than the power of power .
that means 15 pounds of wildlife are needed to get a pound tuna .
we just wanted to know what is because with a normal , normal electrochemical battery battery .
a tv or a washing machine that they only use , they don &apos;t need them .
in a sense , the arctic ice caps are the heart of our global climate system .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view , the fish knows something .
and this was an example of what our own governments are using technology against us , citizens , citizens .
we want to fight genomics and discrimination in the criminal system .
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually recorded .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
and what we actually did is we have humanity , we started to abstract .
this is because the government is further like an ocean , and politics are the top 15-15 inches .
at the end of one day , i made a huge tank soup that we shared .
something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice , like this slide .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , so long they &apos;re not a particle physicist .
either &quot; flesh fusion &quot; or &quot; paradise winds , &quot; you will have the choice .
you can &apos;t just emphasize enough , like the key factor for the quality of a human being .
so by interacting the sickers , and they can interact with each other , he can interact the characters ...
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no men in their treatment .
it came to me like we were going to send our apartments and cameras out of it .
how can we hold them longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times fresh .
and the side of the side of the roandrogene , which are virilium hormones .
i was the second volunteer at the brand , so i had a pretty good opportunity to get into it .
and the argument here is that the wheels of evolution would be slowly , but they &apos;re unbittered .
players love to become part of the presence of the missions of planetary array .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are master-player .
you understand , there are two countries that are controlling almost seven percent of phosphorus phosphorus worldwide .
in china , a news oppony now is still going to be honey , you know , yes ?
it actually took a few years to start with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
and the preparation were enormous . we had to build cameras and gaps and all kinds of things .
but what voodoo does so interesting is this live relationship between the living and the dead .
because obviously , an animal that was very often there , even rarely before it dies .
and sometimes , when something comes over ted , it gets a meaning and force that wouldn &apos;t have it else .
you have to do the sound of the winds , you have to read them away and read the rest of the book .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think it &apos;s something like this .
they &apos;re not fighting this fight that we &apos;re all fighting to speak to who they &apos;re all allowed to talk .
you might think that this is just a landscape , and the bottom part was manipulated .
and the next piece of puzzle is about four women in three generations that build a new life .
the one on the left is jazz and the right is in the right , but you know what ?
just to give you the view , i zoom out , so you see what you get .
and as part of it , they made us a concept of anatomic commons .
or are we going to be able to get something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
i really hope that we play together with major games to survive on this planet another century .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and seventh itself that can afford it .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress like earlier .
the idea of this is obviously not only , the machine agencies in the control room .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- has really come out of the socks .
these basic boxies don &apos;t walk with winds ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
now , when i was a nice college in college , i had my first design curse .
and that &apos;s half of all water problems in the world that are caused by the textile industry .
this is almost with complete security , uncertainty -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
in this country , there are children who are living longevity without condition .
here &apos;s what we understand under policy-correctability to get again .
we need to prevent that people are long from things , especially when they &apos;re true .
that i &apos;m just doing this differently and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
now , reproduces all the remains that have the nucleus on the best .
his mother was saved as punishment for -- for crime to be wealthy .
it kind of came to find the time to find english and italy .
two : famine shers in somalia . the speaker three : pffery of the police police .
but it &apos;s not true , we have seen in europe in seven percent and our web is physically physical .
so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most likely children &apos;s book .
the next piece of puzzle shows how a boat is running in the early mortgage of red lake .
that sounds very closely , and sounds very , very science-fiction fiction , i know .
now , if i &apos;m talking about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
so , probably , or bad acquisition , fisheries , create a part of our future .
both of them are strong , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as much as we should .
the new day , she lifted her -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
and also , despite their logarithmeal , it &apos;s lost on the left-hand side .
michael jj. nelson of the mystery theater was one of the first to twitter about it .
so we also want to understand each other , i want to show you a very basic , very simple trick .
and so you can see animals that are right next to 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
so , in the kind of shifting shift of evidence , they experience the great lie of the gap .
already in some bottles of lakes in alaska methane itself from the water .
for her life , she had a task : the fluctuation of her family and a new life in australia .
and in reality , if we fail , if we fall on obstacles , we often feel different .
to this archaic model , that we have a natural relationship to virtual reality .
as a child , i had collectors of chickers , a box , kicks and mutiles .
and so from the interest in this technology , i went on to this technology .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a ice shelter , which is at space temperature .
unfortunately , not in openings , but maybe you can help the fear of france .
in high school , a student said that brian goldman would learn a flower for a flower .
i &apos;m going to go to a statistics that i hope most of you have heard .
so if we look at the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and like many people , i thought that the government is mostly about choosing people in an amt .
so it &apos;s all the tools , and the only thing that we can do is our imagination .
if someone would ask you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , how would you be ?
so basically , what i &apos;m talking about is , if you &apos;re looking at something , that &apos;s impossible , it &apos;s possible .
because the lesson that i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
and maybe we don &apos;t know what wood we &apos;re protected when we &apos;re really going to test .
a third sentence that &apos;s immediately appeared to people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
this is what you call the oldest law or the old-psychology that is also affecting us in perception .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re sitting next to the owner as an old age .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtual ability as a real habitat .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
i can accelerate the whole sequence by accelerating the pace in one or other direction .
so this question was so disappointed that we decided to explore the research of the answer , and we decided to sideways .
we say , &quot; computers , generic , please have hundreds of millions of unfolded consequences of instructions .
do things that are easy to use , and they start with this patient , in the poor .
and i think the most important point is that we &apos;ve stopped talking to our patients .
so maybe we sell a shoe , and he &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe you &apos;ve ever wearing ...
why not have the quick muscles that will allow you to get faster and longer ?
we know that as human beings , we work as a human being , if we do hard , significant work .
we know from this study that you have to get to the needle when it &apos;s going to go to the thing .
i &apos;ve taught you an example of the north american canopy of noot-india .
maybe an aging understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of creative creative .
we now have almost an infinite choice of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century , so we can predict the development .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privilege of privileged , silly constraints .
so we could do the world very easily with duzzes , maybe hundreds of new cities .
when i went back 27 years later , the fish was on half of his size .
well , morgan , in the name of transparency , what &apos;s going on right now with the $ 7100 ?
it &apos;s almost impossible to be bad to be bad when you &apos;re wearing light red .
do we use these decisions to form a society that &apos;s better than successful , which is more friendly ?
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change your cells ?
this also provides the entertainment of this speech , that &apos;s why i hope it &apos;s hatred to you .
but in fact , my research at the institute for the future is exactly the opposite .
there &apos;s nothing going on in my era or comes out , not trickling . and you can study everything .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics that made me not be a fanatic .
you can see it &apos;s a kind of mammals , often known as &quot; migrant reactor . &quot;
i remembered myself last year when i got mosquitoes and sort of liked people .
the most important thing for the age , the most semester , the great laws of laws .
40 percent of all people in the world get half of their drinking water from this melting water .
this is great . the tube didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
the viral particles were released by the cells and came back and killed ecoli . coli .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve added this point where our choice improved .
well , you can see , all the cases , no one has to be a visible candidate .
most of the mass infection in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of violent crime .
this reference is proven to spend the money in more security bureaucracies and security .
police officers came in and defeated government lawyers and offices .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write from hand .
so for me , it seemed to be more likely to be at the right place at the right time .
and this sadness really formed in a thought , which is that i just want one thing to do .
and by the way , it &apos;s been for 500 years , since his , as i have to say , very successful leadership .
you don &apos;t sit around , and you turn around . there &apos;s always something important to do .
our memory tells us stories that means what we can keep in our experience is a story .
do you say there are negative effects to do with the clouds that change things ?
this is sort of the deadline that showed us the environmental models that we need to do .
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some of them .
i &apos;m sure they &apos;re not taught . they &apos;re actually not going to leave the glass .
that &apos;s why many people come and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
she heard about this book from charles darwin , the emergence of species and the absence of people .
i asked my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , oma , that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
evolution is all about the increase in the next generation , adapting and survival generation after generation .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital , just great -- until on my physical therapy .
well , if i had ever opened up with the 600 images in it , i would have spent another hour .
people are in their faith , and that &apos;s how to free them , you cannot free them .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design machine .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor , which seems to be difficult , but maybe saying that .
so here we see this again again , again , the el , again , the whole , single aggregate .
view : now i &apos;m interacting with the object , can zoom out again , zoom in .
so , first of all , banal , but it &apos;s very exciting when you &apos;re getting closer to it .
because often people are coming , you can &apos;t do it , so everyone can deal with it .
this is a game with literally a mixture of scared and bogy .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it will be a huge challenge .
if you break the gold glass of water so that everything is possible , it &apos;s the satisfaction of happiness .
if i put in a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think about me .
but finally , i decided , my god , i &apos;ve got to go to the court and wear this crazy case .
and finally , a study was done with ceos that they saw for a week , the ceos observed .
so we overwhelmed our brains , because our brain doesn &apos;t really accept that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
i got another gift to see the future and come back to life .
that means we have a common ancestry , a evolutionary grandmother that lived around six million years ago .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
so we have the memory of self and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
unfortunately , this is the whole good news , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;re often mentioned .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing their lifestyle .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got only two years later on when we moved to california .
so you need the learning process of music at least as long as the spots of spoken language .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put these little pieces together , and the errors could correct .
we &apos;ve done it in about a hundred genes to the 500 or so that they are here .
and this really enables these ideas to create constraints for the available space on the screen .
and it &apos;s devastating to think that our species might have existed for 600,000 years .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that we do .
we developed an app for layar , extended reality to find these aeds .
and by the way , there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m going to tell you about a truck that works on the wireless .
we use this great euphemism , try and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the very passive .
so if you want to do the happiness of the self , you want to do very different things .
as peter told us , she didn &apos;t just produce the highest doors , but also the most interesting structures of all .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have any crescue .
we hope that this is not a pop-up and other nonsense -- that should not be necessary .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather was not afraid of the arctic night or the weather storm .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for each person on this planet .
and to win , the device needs to be a better diagnosis than a team of highly qualified doctors .
the foods were from my view of the original atomic activist activists , and that &apos;s why .
they played a worker game and the victims to a episode adventure .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are success of scientific method .
that would have been without the space policy , but the power is so much more important .
certainly , i would never meet an alien world with a spaceship ship . this seemed pretty unlikely to me .
we &apos;re not going to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen in the moment .
well , just to close , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
who knows when the film comes out , maybe we might see a horses of horses .
what are we going to start with the fact that we &apos;re just different from them through a few nucleotides ?
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then increase my strength and expanding my strength .
but if you &apos;re in a episode adventure , and you &apos;re saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to go out of oil . &quot;
because if we could figure this out , we would never have given human potential to be available .
and that &apos;s going to be worse , and pretty soon kids will die , because that &apos;s just one of the numbers of numbers .
in the rich world , the millions of us have only threatened a generation , hardly .
here we see a very fundamental service . there &apos;s light at home so you can read the homework ?
the greeks called these goddess mental intellectual spiders of creativity .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see how she &apos;s going to go to the next century .
and in this , we installed an evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going on in the microseal area .
so in other words , the future of every year is around a year since i &apos;m on this world .
they shoot the decision -- they shoot them , even when it comes to their own best interest .
so things like this -- you know , people remember -- this is kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , you &apos;re not only going to understand it , you &apos;re going to appreciate it .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said that they did this model .
one way that &apos;s particularly interesting is , and what i &apos;ve used in the last time is evolution itself .
we had a team of rock lows in boston for the code for programming .
so , imagine if you were at the same time , how would that feel ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
so the nerve cells are the information processing , the cell communities built these cell communities .
so , it was possible to connect the little digital sprint with the rotorium .
eaceeeea , a little antioxidants that helps you on the jump .
no , the lying that i &apos;m talking about has to do with it is to deceive itself .
when professors become curious , they &apos;re going to be so often in the research of the research .
this is the machine age of machine , and it &apos;s the book , and it &apos;s the oliver gray .
and it &apos;s about playing with a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first with the fuel of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
it turns out that it was really meant , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do anything with your film . &quot;
in the moment , it was like a film director would have landed a bloody change .
this is what if i would say , shy your child , only three times more than five times .
and the main lesson that we think is that they &apos;re really different .
but there &apos;s no versions that we can look at where you learn how to make fire .
his will be to write the piece , will always be more and more to my personal , to play it .
but these concepts of the cyberage that bring us to discover these possibilities back again .
so these floods have longer to survive , and they &apos;re going to fall in greenhouse .
so just like this , you know , these words that we use in the language of the political correct correction always .
the first example of what many of you know and some of you are estimated , very few people don &apos;t need at all .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could do a or we could do b b .
i want to talk to you with this mechanism today or something that you &apos;re unfamiliar with .
so now , i &apos;m in front of my favorite images , harvest workers from the tar breeder .
but now , when you get the evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
in openness , for example , the garbage has 20 percent of the garbage between wind .
but then , again , very rarely , something happened , and one of the people was actually translated in the world .
my heart rage , i was a winder while i was trying to grab what was going on .
the human part of this bumper , far at the end , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
immediately , you &apos;re going to be able to find one for those of you who have this prediction , you can &apos;t prove that .
they &apos;ve reformed the demographics of the earth in a way that it has no war ever done .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that &apos;s being changed at a time , a lot of biology is adapted .
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to be embedded by the mind . how can you feel damage ?
for these non-engineers , littlin was another material , electronics was just another material .
so what can three-billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the community bring us ?
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that indian is disgusting , but it &apos;s also a lot of time .
and every time it divided , the population has been distributed to the same amounts of chemicals .
so i would say there are three simple rules to follow , to achieve a realistic result .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts in the process when the trigger gets touched .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process , when you put on the sheet .
yet my interest in photography , when i received my first digital camera , at the age of 15 years .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , this black object you see .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break into 20 parts , as you know it from documentations .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of my life trying to try to be myself and adapt at the same time .
but not just that -- so they &apos;re connected and they &apos;re connecting with the universe and other devices out there .
three billion hours a week are not close enough to solve the most important problems of the world .
there are such strikes things like these all kinds of complex plants that are changing on the beckers .
if any of those who had built a 550-foot construction construction , he would have carved the price home .
i met mr in 2008 , two years ago , in whale disney hall .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far can you take a piece of future .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus , which really had to go back into circles .
the result is that i don &apos;t know where i get treated when i was going to be a conversation .
you can go out and create your own museum -- from all these images , you can put your own collection on your own collection .
so , in the large and all of us , we &apos;re very reliable that we actually have determined what the goal is .
well , it &apos;s a common sense for ordinary something that you find , because you &apos;ve got it somewhere .
so the idea is that we actually emphasize the people in which they do things together , collective .
at home in new york , i &apos;m a chef of a nonprofit organization called robin .
it &apos;s like satisfaction or happy the person , when this person thinks about their lives .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay in the future , and now you can &apos;t stay here .
they lie , they &apos;re surrounded , they &apos;re confused , and they &apos;re really drunk .
because the soil is going to die the moose and the wind and the water &apos;s going to get the soil away .
so , as a citizen , you &apos;re going to be able to be able to deal with these scientific technologies .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you see in the same way .
this is one of the images that we &apos;ve been able to do with something called the gigapxic technology .
well , since the film at the session festival festival , we can look at this .
and every time i interviewed somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
pollinators are born as a cold of a glacier or break out of ice sheets .
so in this project , we actually designed some little marker to pursue the garbage as it goes through the system .
our language goes to the social changes that have been solved in many cases by a technological change .
but danny , in the entire american desire , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
i know that we can do it , and as far as it &apos;s something that needs the world now .
about a decade ago , i wrote a paper about vaccine for the new yorker , a little article .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , but we &apos;re going to see how the teams are different .
and even though it really seems easy , it &apos;s really hard because people work very quickly .
there are very , very few things you can say at all , where there &apos;s a chance in a million .
and i fell on , like this very deep sea level , a space mission .
this was the movement . it was the refugee . it was the business of the american agriculture .
and when i get with my little v w , and i just dancing this feeling .
there &apos;s an old african dictionary saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , regret alone .
we made little pieces , we made an error correction , and we had a dna of about 5,000 letters .
they found an article with false thought , they could feel the judgment of this thought .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the stream , as nobody could ever predict it .
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , oma . i promise it . &quot;
i &apos;ve been trying to make sure how valuable cities are , how much valuable they are .
and it seemed to have a little bit of preferred with this gray boxing , this real-time control systems .
and you &apos;re going to offer all the nutrients that they could only offer without an effort .
if a spirit of these qualities , we can create a new reality and create new ways .
possibly , the point is the meaning of funny skills , a perception of iden , a feeling for our own force .
the challenge is to build a common experience , a common language . property , to build the right prototype .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six , you get the stable structures .
and there &apos;s certainly unclear about how bad these things are going to follow , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
if we can do that , this biscuts will all be , maybe a new source of information is full of information .
this is really important because this is a realization that doesn &apos;t put in a single wider pedil .
in holland , you know , of course , get easier because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
and so it &apos;s also so strong in us that we can deal with virtuality as well as well .
and they &apos;re convicted by rare plants , so they &apos;re carrying away from throwing away from the biodiversity to biodiversity .
the electronics had a dozen components , and they look at the diversity of it .
we had a team working on a project in boston for three and a half months .
and the first thing i asked is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
from the people who love it as 24 , only three percent were actually a glass marry .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of my friend from guineala vitao to tedtalk to tedtalk .
i have to talk to the man on the street that are as i do , normal consumers .
then one day , he came back from walking and said , &quot; dad , my legs are crying . &quot;
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that people are not separated by nature , and that everything is connected to each other .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the victory team and meet the prime minister at the same time .
and we don &apos;t like our kids , if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t fit .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people , actually , even more important than any other planet on the planet .
in the present , we have a very modern example that goes back again .

but if you &apos;ve got very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a mammals -- you dig them off without all the complex qualities .
we &apos;re going to turn it off , and expect the first data in juni or july , and put our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
we want to create the world of creating inventor , the inventor , the inventors , because this world , in which we live in , these interactive world , belonging us .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country where there is no doctors , but 25 percent of the burden and 1.3 percent of the staff of the health care .
so i decided one day to visit the filiters , and i asked the head , &quot; does this model work works for people to really offer all these opportunities ? &quot;
the head of congress came to the stage and said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we might look at the tedtalk .
we need to do these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time machine and go to the future , we will be happy to have that .
so i stood up with a little team on unknown terrain , and we drew &quot; avatar &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that wasn &apos;t there before .
and then we have the one that &apos;s not true , but that &apos;s what i think , i think , has been pretty good enough , people are pretty convinced .
i mean , it can be strange to think that a thing is at the same time in two different places , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea , they developed .

so an organism could learn , for example , a certain fruit couldn &apos;t eat , because it was bad and made him sick , the last time he got her .
personally . it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to go to compromise with the ideas in your head .
it &apos;s about how to encounter people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media , and they can create a peaceful experience .
finally , this elderly black man came with a very concerned facial expressions in the courts and sat right behind me , almost on the defense bank .
there &apos;s this airplane that &apos;s made out of hundreds of thousands of pieces that work together to make their flight . &apos; do not make you visible ? &quot;
one day -- this is a real report -- this came in , &quot; thylacine in my trash . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
and just as the woman who wanted to learn me as adults , to meet me , she turned into a box full full of mine and was put in my hands .
we &apos;re going to have a process that may be done in the rule of 100,000 years , and we can compress it on a thousand years -- and maybe even at the next 100 years .
there &apos;s a series of people who have much more &quot; uh-oh moments than others , and among the worst test are frozen bold .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at before we see it back to our back in our seats to say , to say , okay , okay .
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a billion-dollar second after the universe -- and to 600 million times a second .
but they also have a secret to our future , a future where we have to adapt to more and more challenges , through larger creativity and impressive surgery .
and a lot of discussions that i had in the last six years have been similar to the discussion that i had in the last three years , had a photovoltaic .
a savoracier , if you make the power full of water , the pressure has enough pressure , so i think i think it &apos;s about four to six to sixth grade .
and something interesting happened to me , which was what i was talking about jacques cousteau , was the thought of a completely unknown world here on our earth .
and our european connected net is basically just made of laughter mammals of large power , where the wave is always going to be the wave around europe .
one process that -- as everyone knows , who has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everybody here -- is not always reasonable .
and every year we ask the students to create products , products and services , which are within a decade , the lives of the milky way of humans can flourish .
i came to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral scholar of the universe is far apart , but it &apos;s going to increase the justice .
and finally , saturday : a unique , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world a little bit about something without having to say a word .
they didn &apos;t count because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had to keep .
i think the molecular biology in general is now very general , biotechnology , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
how would it be to give the bottom of where they &apos;re always there to be a voice to focus on attention and change , for the first time ?
i love to find it to every opportunity to find a different colorful , inspiring outcomes , and photographed in the last time and blogging blogging .
i &apos;ve always told my wife , whenever a human being used in a moral rehabilitation , because we should try to replace it through the dictionary .
and it turns out that if you make it that something feels concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people more .
so we &apos;re not only responsible for the people that we love to preserve faithes , but they also pretend to get good .
so we take something very complicated , converting it into sounds , a sequence of sounds , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
no , it just looks much better than if we show that we &apos;re all in the way that the dangers make , the other ones that make them fire .
now , in egypt , in egypt , the output in april 2011 , the headquarter of the egyptians of egyptian police , and they found a lot of actors .

so this is what this reactor was a problem that we fill in our fill , and it reduces the volume dramatically dramatically as this process .
in fact , we start from a new point : we have the biology and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new phase of biology by creating new life and building new .
but this keeps me up at night -- one of the things that kept me up at night , and we &apos;ve never used scientific progress as much as we have now .
lo rrarity was the premier in january , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls of this film .
yes , this is a huge debate at the moment , at the moment of the coal force force , because we don &apos;t otherwise , or any weather binds , because that &apos;s not going to go .
a lot of our friends thought that we were beautiful to do that , and that we &apos;re back to cheese and all the pictures of the walls would be the graffettes .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst error only happened in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues , but it &apos;s total nonsense .

it seems that we would be right away from the other parts of the building , but in fact , the biggest part is the most fundamental mechanisms that our cells are pretty similar .
but the logic of deception allows us to do it as if the first sentence was the first set of preventing , as you had to think about the opposite without proof .
it &apos;s always a very happy concern , if i can have the experience that i &apos;ve been working on , that i &apos;ve been working so long in the way that i &apos;ve been able to experience new .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up to my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to listen to you . &quot;
well , there are marks and eighty marks , these things that come and go , but there was a verb , marke is a pretty strong thing .
and if you &apos;ve got lunch , the drugs of stupile are complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the user data is a science .
if i tell you that somebody has been a life as eight on a scale of 10 , they have much uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self .
well , i started with a few people in the company , and no one could give me an extraordinary answer , until i finally ended up with the biologists .
basically , you get any round of people on any random randomly letter , and while you &apos;re trying to build words , you &apos;re going to test those words about a dictionary .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot of well-being , or maybe a little less likely to talk to you about it .
but then another , very interesting step , where things were completely different , because these cells began to communicate and dive information so that communities came from cells .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference , we say , in climate .
they start out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see is fluid channels and these dense poles .
we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more than individuals to make us the great challenges of our planet .
so a app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spread by rare , is a kind of sharp in front of the institution .

so it &apos;s so far . and for all those of you who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that has ever been taken -- 27 miles in the diameter .
and i &apos;ve argued that we may be creating a new form of campus in which there could be massive new species based on this digital design .
the reason it was better than everything was worse than everything was worse than everything was bad , it was possible for people to make a pleasant experience .
and i &apos;d handed with me that if i double my efforts to perfection and never had a mistake that the voice could degrab the voice .
so this is just a few of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- it would have been the last six days , or the last six years .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew i had several months to plan them to find the different places for the puzzles .

the film i sold this as a &quot; romeo and julia on a ship , &quot; it became a film called the documentary , a passionate film .
now , in discussions , this insulin is trying to do , these insulin , who have a little bit of your own web , that has nothing to do with our connected and nothing .

and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s grown up to the internet , and the knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you just need to build the systems right .
and so far the isolation is when we &apos;re looking at species on the planet , there &apos;s isolation and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science . but i certainly think you &apos;re going to have to lead a shelf , a leader like a shipping sketch or something like this .
and after a very short period of time , it had lost all characteristics of species and converted into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .

so , the problem of cooperative worlds , like world warehouse , is that it &apos;s so peaceful to be at the edge of a episode of an episode that we &apos;d rather be spending our whole time in those worlds .
later on day , i went to this basel with miguel , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems to be so natural , &quot; as any farm i had ever been on , &quot; how do you succeed ? &quot;

it empowered us to tell the story of neuromarketing , as we tell the story in this film , that today you use mris mris to make the lustis of the central sheets of the brain to make both movies and movies .
so i started thinking , and so i think , with safety in the past months , while i was working on the book , that &apos;s soon going to seem to be -- as the dangerous , terrifying , an expectancy of my outcomes .
both in my profession , robin laden , as well as an elderly man , i &apos;m a fireman of generosity and generosity and friendship in large scale , but i also see the next love and love of individuals .
suppose they live in a certain remote area , and they have loved one of their loved ones with wedding heart vessels , and their householders overcome to this cardiac cardiac , whose average performance is at least 200 .
but when i was talking to him , and he asked him why he had this intervention -- it was high risky surgeries -- his answer was that in his country , these kids were going to be very bad , and so he had to do it .
and when , of course , something is intuitively intuitively intuitive , and how can i take the age and make things like that , that they &apos;re using a friendly friendship , so they &apos;re intuitive because they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re just fun to use .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do . the ones that have the battling shapets , and the constraints that are shaking with bad results and the good results .
it &apos;s also got three big problems . the cost , especially in high-resolution countries . the question is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human work , despite the work that the fuel is not used for weapons .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid to have a real gasoline , and it keeps millions of people from the blows .
now , to decide not to buy a glass marker is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our silence -- but it turns out that the decision-making problem is also very rich in congress .
i don &apos;t have to make this emotionally emotionally , because the corner is going to be a different kind of crazy , colorful , colorful , shaped out of the output , just waiting for me if i love a little bit of love in heart and search .

here &apos;s a photograph that i took at the northern baffs of the baffs islands when i went to the narrogated whale , and this man , olaolya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of memory itself , and you can think of the memory itself as a kind of living itself , which is kind of a living self that doesn &apos;t need to be alive .

so what that means is , if we look back to what &apos;s going on in evolution , and how we think about the place of humans in evolution , and particularly we look at the predictions in the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
so there are great challenges here . there are challenges in transmission . if we say that energy is outside the country , they don &apos;t just need the technology , they also have to deal with the risk of energy where the energy comes from .
but , as we think , the only way we think , the only way we think of biology is a big influence without any amount of nutrition on food , or restriction of the resources that are available when we see co2 as a carbon material , and that &apos;s why we work on these cells .
i started working with this scientific literature on how these centrifurization were built in natenia , and found that they were structured turics in so-called kaskage , and every kaskage revealed 164 .
now , the fascinating thing is that the cutaoline coline , which are in the liane , mao inhibitors , are exactly the way that &apos;s necessary to ask the trypine . so they ask themselves .
this is a problem because the global warming comes down to the arctic ocean , where there are big amounts of frozen carbon dioxide , which is when they look at microbes of micromethane .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of attack was actually to let it happen and uncure -- obviously , trying to desperate engineer engineers , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get out of it fast .
so maybe this technological change is clear , because the other thing that there was a different truth , which is that every human being is something special and very powerful and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt is our biggest one .
my good friend ray short has shown us that every tool that &apos;s going to become information technology , on the curve of moores , it &apos;s a big law , and it &apos;s the price of primes , and the price performance of all 12 to 24 months .

that &apos;s what we feel so guilty about the earth that we say . there &apos;s no biolanding , no bioluminescent , no longer-progress-progressing progression , and as they all means that our own creature are going back .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i did something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in single organisms , divide each cell , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is led into both dead cells .
this was worth me for all of this year in the clean room , because , you know , the massing difference between an individual and a piece of metal is about as much as the difference between the metal and all the matter of the metal .
and then i got up to six neanderthals , and then we got together with friends of the company , and then i came together with the founder of the company , which then came together with the spill of a spike of the largest cell manufacturers in the world .

and the message is , well , we have to be on these rotating mammals , if we were to have our goals , forced , 20 percent , forced , 20 percent , three-percent , three-percent , three-percent , and so on , if we want to do it at all .
and then you &apos;ve got over a three-month period of students with a &quot; sufficient &quot; the note &quot; the note &quot; very well . it was told you that they were very smart . and after three months , they really wrote .

but we don &apos;t even say , if we listen to somebody like this , because we &apos;ve been familiar with these kinds of times as long as long as we &apos;ve kind of seen the internal experience and accepting collective acceptance , that creativity and somehow , of course , that art and that art is always the seal equal .
and what we did was actually use a new kind of network of network that was used all over the world -- this is a mobile phone network -- telephone and anonymous and anonymous information from this network that will be collected by the neohunters to understand how the city works .
and then the renaissance and everything we did . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual in the center of the universe -- about all gods and mysteries and mysteries , and there &apos;s no space for mystical creatures that accept from the goddles .
in our desire to protect people who are heart , and they are the cold , hard truth , about their medical proposals , or even make a profoundly quality of the quality of life , which we have to expect , that we don &apos;t have to fit the baseline that somebody actually is disabled .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques , which is the problem of decision-making -- restricted -- you &apos;re going to be able to get the liquid alternatives ; concrete ; they &apos;re doing it ; they &apos;re doing real categorities -- we can better deal with more categories , less possibilities .
because we &apos;re going to be this self-deception , this feeling great , unintended by the highest creature , not from such a recurrent , from something as uncomputed as an organism that exists still to a stone , and which is something that is unable to us unable .
and then this is , if you &apos;re all your feelings about politics , and the snakes of work and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about , the government is in the core of tim , in the words of tim lo &apos;lo lly , &quot; which we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
this may seem like a little bit abandoned , so i repeat it so that if we can solve problems like hunger , climate change , global conflict , global conflict and obesity , i think we have to try to try to play online for at least billions of hours a week for 21 hours a week .
and our goal was , we wanted to go to seventh to nine-percent renewable renewable , and then there &apos;s another rest of this , the rest of the rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , that &apos;s going to be very expensive , very expensive and it &apos;s not going to work out of batteries .
but what &apos;s going to find 17 mate partners that were willing to spend on this control that wanted to do with somebody &apos;s business and play like me , and the one that i finally started to tell us to tell stories that we couldn &apos;t normally tell -- stories that would never help .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never be able to simulate , whether it &apos;s going to work , but there &apos;s a modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and you can simulate it , and you can see that ! yes , with the right materials , it looks like it looks like it works .
but the process and the heavy sticking , which is surrounded him , when he took the genius out of the genius , where he didn &apos;t take anything out of it , and then let him go back to where he came from , and he realized that it didn &apos;t have to be an internal thing , cold thing .
this strange event was that i &apos;ve written a book recently -- a biography called music , pray , pray , god -- that decided to be different from all my previous books in the world , and a big event , international christian thing .
a continent is always left out , because the guess was that there was no religious faith in sub-saharan africa , of course , and there was a voodoo , and there &apos;s a voodoo is just the remains of this very deep religious religious thinking while the tragic pordian pora came over time .
but in fact , we see it more and more and more that if you &apos;re willing to confront , and the unimportant ways of the unprecedented possibilities are now , then there &apos;s a increase in numbers of numbers that are sold , there &apos;s the cost , and there &apos;s a improvement of decision-making sense .
and one day he looked at me at one of my usual practices -- these practices were just tired and nasty -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a powerful , powerful and it &apos;s a young girl , and you &apos;ll be one day one day of those dancers .
and the wind and the sun and the burden came through , and the result of the result , a very exciting result of the result of conventional conventional system , which is for 20 years to go down to the middle class of about five cents a killer per kilowatt-hour , takes about four cents at four cents .
and problem , it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can be just a compelling problem , which is how simple things do , so that a simple problem is to throw a question , and how can you do that , or how to do it better .
feeders eat crops of planners , thumb fare fits of monopolitical cultures , the earth , the hills , the fish , and all the time the agrass industry just asked , &quot; if we feed more cheap , how can it be ? &quot;
not through the latest rescue rescue and tragic inventors , but by fruit land , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not through fresh water , not through hot water , but through the forests , and not through fishing boats , but through fish , but by fish in the sea .
so this is a more artistic direction , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and philosophers , working with scientists with scientists with these technologies and asking for questions and asking them to work out and work out the creative , because there are museum , and there &apos;s all sorts of things .
you &apos;re putting the sum of carbon dioxide , which leads to temperature , and that temperature has some very negative effects . effects on the weather , and perhaps worse , the indigenous sequence that the natural systems can &apos;t adapt to the system and then look at all kinds of systems .
advice are things that are playful , which is frozen , as the prince of prince , desperate , degradation , desperate and loved ones , and how inheritable floors , and reacting , magible , magical , magical and how mystic .
in other cases , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house , and she didn &apos;t put the poem through them , and she passes them through them , and she passes them , and she said it was going to move over land -- and as she said , &quot; you know , you know , you know , they &apos;re looking for another poet .
now , this may be a modern contribution , and if you were better than i was expected , but my core statement is here is that we have to work on all five people , and we can &apos;t give them any of them , because they &apos;re all major problems .
and where you can see how far we &apos;re going to be away from what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , we &apos;re at the earth at all , you can see that for example , for example , an openly program , until you want to be here , you want to be here , yes , right ?
in my 2020 years of medical sence and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study of medical error and false treatments for everything so much for my first article , i &apos;ve been able to learn the first article for the toronto , &quot; cake black , &quot; to learn how to learn .
now , with total transparency , which is the new thinking about what &apos;s going on on the old thinking , yes , not that in laser meat and flour meat , and no more beef or other phenomena , which i want to do right now , and that &apos;s what i want to do .
now , not exactly what i was hoping to me , but i went down -- the stairs , the fluid , along the fireflies , the &quot; firefirefirefiremen , who ended up going to this time with this kind of finished , were pretty much done in the room to get a pair of shoes .
i had to finally have a little bit of practice to repeat with these , elastic bones -- in different colors -- that you know , to build my leg muscles . and i hated these dancers more than anything . i hate them . i hated them . i hated them . i hate them . i hate them .
but we wanted to go a lot further . we wanted to build a whole bacterial chromosome . it has more than 50,000 letters genetic code . so we thought we could build it in cameras from the size of the virus that we could make the size of the virus to understand what the individual components are .
and from a conversation today , with dean cave , one of the innovators of the do , i want to share with you with you -- he gave me the permission -- his technique , &quot; the slingers , &quot; and the many of you may have heard . it &apos;s got the size of a refrigerator at the university .
&quot; cloud-like &quot; clouds , &quot; something that my friends at autodesk computing computing , &quot; sensors , sensors and networks , robots , robots , 3d printer , enable the personal production of our planet to democratize our planet , synthetic biology , synthetic biology , vaccine , vaccine , organic materials , digital materials and artificial intelligence .
look at this amazing demonstration : voodoo acoustics in a single state , the lightning cooperation without burning compression , an amazing illustration of the mind of the mind to affect the brain , that if it &apos;s going to be an extreme state in the state .
this was the most surgical form of a d√©-j-vu who i &apos;ve ever experienced . because before i had a corner of a boom , i always knew what was going on in the light of the vehicle , i was going to go through monthly by monthly film , as we went to the movie .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bus as a center of despair in all directions , because if you look at the wall of the tree , all the existed specialities of life , all existing existed in this second evolutionary success , you &apos;ve survived in evolutionary success : you &apos;ve survived ; it has its environment and strength .
and s with this premise with this premise with this premise , then brian degin was trying to put a minimum in england , a minimum disabled , then put a steady of printing cooperations , a hot plate , and yes , and so there &apos;s bacteria that bacteria can grow .
and then , and then from the do-it-ituno beverbio website , the green website , and said o.k , we have to meet us now , we have to really meet , and also have two lines , and then have two organizers , in london , a thousand , 10 , and short on it in the u.s. , in san francisco , in san francisco .
this equation has four factors . a little bit multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 , which you want to get zero , and that &apos;s going to depend on the number of people depending on the most services that every human being used in average of the average of the average energy and the energy that &apos;s going to be empowered by the energy unit .
and the realization of president lobo was that the wisdom of the wisdom that i thought was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come and build this city of the city , and build this city for all parties in honoras in honduras that have been under many years of suffering and fear .
i read this list by a friend of mine , and the first time it had to laugh it so ridiculous , but i just came to &quot; court , &quot; and i couldn &apos;t stop talking , and he had to stop reading me , and he had to collect me after this incursion of the emotional currency , and so that it had to be the unintended thing .
a group of anara that i &apos;ve learned from a while ago , who has been a student who want to give a group of students more about what they wanted to learn in college , and they &apos;ve been doing so on street , and they &apos;ve been trying to explain to people what n.na is .
there are 175 resems in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 different obesides and 12 balians that you could buy a large number of sales in your own salad , where you don &apos;t have an improbable rescue in the 175 , you know , it &apos;s not a matter of the 175 for you .
and that was really , really , really , very , very , very bitter , and then you go into the phase of phase , and you just put a picture on a picture where i was asking for 10 years , a thousand years , the mark ethical , which was still there , locally , locally , locally , of course , that &apos;s really cool , that should be so cool .
first of all , what i &apos;m going to show you is as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we have as a part of an exception in front of a year ago . this is seal , and it &apos;s an environment , and it &apos;s an environment that can either be able to deal with large quantities of visual data .
the first one , if you &apos;re going to become a child as a child , as a baby , is that you &apos;re going to take care of what slices you &apos;re going to do , right ? and the more than if your parents can allow you to play , or to play more in your pocket and more , the more , the more the more the more the way your curiosity will come out of the earth .
i mean , i mean , most moments of our life -- and i did it down -- you know , the psychological prescription for about three seconds , which means , you know , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million lives . there are about a month of it . there &apos;s about 600,000 . most of you don &apos;t leave it .
bill gates : to lead the simulation to a supercomputer , to get all the big scientists to get what we &apos;ve done , we need only a few million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s true only in the 1000s .
that really works , that &apos;s going to work in the academic , and then we thought , o.k that we might have done , we might have also taken a webcam , then we took a webcam on the webcam , the smooth , the lens , the reverse , then you have a microscope , which is about a microscope of a 4,000-fold .
if i show you 600 magazines , and you show them in 10 categories , or i show you 400 journals , and these in 20 categories of categories , i think they believe that i have given you more choice and a better choice , when i gave them 400 , when i gave them 400 people to 600 .
friit &apos;s friitous day , friday friday . god frita friday , friday friday . &apos; for example , you know , you know , the kto , don &apos;t friday . friday friday , friday friday friday . &apos; friday &apos; friday . &apos; you don &apos;t think that friday we would do this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
i think i believe a significant thing -- not the only one , but one of the most significant contributors to this depression , and also suicide , is that people have learned that people are disappointed because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain that experience themselves , they would be blame .
the neolithic revolution that brought us agriculture , and we found ourselves in this moment of the grain of the records , the poetry of the poetry , the poetry of the pink through the propink of the pink and hierarchy , specialization and speciesthesized , and specialization created 10,000 years ago -- rather than 10,000 years ago .
this is , if you focus a laser in the room , you can catch little particles in the air , or in the air , and then you get into the air , and then you get into this focus , and then the focus is trapped up , so the way that you get as a torture as a torch principle .
it would be great if we could bring this pattern of normal human beings to another set of possibilities or strength , even to form a little more dangerous , audgetic , so we can put the forces of very many kids , and put them together , and put them in very special ways to bring their special skills into society .
you know , when michelangelo shaped the mosquito , it means that he took him to the hammer and took him to mosque -- you can still see a little bit of a little indrunk -- and she said , &quot; performing chlji ? why don &apos;t you not ? &quot;
but if you buy a new color in 2011 today , if you buy a new colored printer printer of the leading laser printing factory , and you buy a page , you know , it &apos;s got this kind of helpful climb on every page on each side , in a pattern that makes you clear on your side , and you can purchase your backwards .
so , my colleague of my colleague with asha , assazer , you could take a lot more about perceiving that , and the many other wonderful things you can do with real things that you can perceive , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we &apos;re talking about at the beginning , and that &apos;s the contradiction of our environment .
now , the problem , the problem , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have the sympathy for the harm , have been able to look as orginitial and colorful and colorful and colorful , but they kind of look at the past , while the real world , our world .
and then i &apos;ve tried to try this in my lab at my lab , and i &apos;ve been trying to get a little bit of a little bit of fun , and then i &apos;ve bought something like that on ebay , and bought a little n.n.n. analysis , trying to do a father , so that &apos;s so much n.n.
and if you &apos;re going to choose one other vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two types of self , and you have to think about how you &apos;re going to choose this conflict , and that &apos;s not really obvious , because if you &apos;re going to get a sense of time , and if you think about it , if you think about a different way , you could get another memory .
in the early &apos; 800s , i got a really amazing job when my professor at harvard asked if i was interested in haiti to go to haiti and film the secret societies that were able to film the most secret of duty and the strength of dutone and maton cousin , and that was used to make it safe .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me how i &apos;m going to go and i &apos;m going to do something , and i &apos;m going to give you something : this sentence has never fit for me , and i always feel very uncomfortable with asking people to answer , and i think , too , i understand why i understand why .
and if i &apos;m now talking about this , for example , in which i &apos;m going to send to overview as overwhelming , selective selection as a choice , as an injured , where it comes up to me , i can see it in detail , and yes , i can see that , i can send it somewhere else , or buy somebody else , or whatever .
i recommend all of you to read steals or look at the film , so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that came between those two men , but also how the music helped the music and how the instrument was , when that instrument is allowed to get the game , the middle east , the way to get off the street .
down here in the picture , you see the lab , in anesthetics , so there &apos;s a garage that was also so able to put together with all kinds of lab systems , which has immensely inated , a group in paris , which has something that has done in paris , and it &apos;s pretty interesting , and it &apos;s pretty interesting , and i want to do some kind of thing for a project .
not a biologist , for example , would claim that 50 percent or more of all species are extinct from the extinction , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this is the apocalyptians -- the apocalyptic scenes on the biodiversity of biological diversity -- which is barely the most optimistic of the biodiversity around the cultural diversity .
bg : well , we haven &apos;t yet taken us to a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting openness for all of the nuclear rules in the name . there &apos;s a big interest in the name , and there &apos;s a big interest in russia in russia , india , india , china -- and i &apos;ve been talking about the empowerment of energy , and how this is how we call this .
the computer visions have given these pictures together so that they put in the real room , where all of the images that were made near the grassroots in the canadian rock rockets , and they &apos;re looking at elements of injury or injury , and these things have been surrounded all in touch with each other .
and if you look at the software that we just saw , you &apos;ll see why you &apos;re going to understand why ninety-nine percent of our software , or not intuitive to use , it &apos;s useless in ipad or an ipad , which is closed in many , or even more intuitive appliances , although it &apos;s more intuitive than classic software .
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy , &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but in reality , one of the burden is a transformation of the responsibility for someone who knows something about namely -- the name of someone who knows anything -- to know nothing about it , and probably doesn &apos;t get sick , and that &apos;s why the best decision is to make a patient &apos;s decision -- the patient .
and this idea was when i was in the middle of the writing , pray , pray . i was in one of these crumbs of the branches that we all fall in , when we fall into something and we don &apos;t work . you &apos;re thinking that it &apos;s going to be a desk . that &apos;s the worst book that the book ever written .
we also have one of these same agents in the same size of the size of the size , as it stands there , in half , to actually see the complete dynamic behavior of this network , so in half of this network , where it looks like this , right now , where the el is standing here , the big batteries here , the whole batteries that we simultaneously simulate the net .
and they believed that a genius was this kind of magic divince that was believed that it was literally literally literally literally in the walls of an artist &apos;s artist &apos;s artist &apos;s artist &apos;s studio -- about as a dodf , the jelf and the artist , and the artist in a certain way that would make the work invisible , and the job of the work .
if i want to give you one thing today , it &apos;s that the total data that we consume is larger than the sum of the parts of your parts , and instead of thinking of thinking about information translation , i want you to think about how we can use information that information is so different , and we can see the trends that were not visible .
so we &apos;ve been working in a study that i &apos;ve done with shlomo bengi and alandro and alandro tero , we &apos;ve done a study with the people at mit -- who &apos;ve been working for everyone -- and these people have been involved in a collection of collection where they &apos;ve created their savings for their savings .
interesting historical footnote : when motherlands took the southresses of southern spain , and the language changed over the centuries of centuries of allah , lah allah , allah lah , ololred , ololololololt , which you still have to fight at pennitrogen and flattitudes .
now , today , you need to win , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this -- something that wakes the car in real time , has some sensors sensors , some sensors that information made out of the car , and then you &apos;re working on the information , and then you &apos;re going to use this car to make decisions back and send things back into real information .
i was afraid i was not afraid , not because of it , but i was afraid that i could lose him that he could sink in one of his conditions , and that i could destroy him to destroy his relationship to the mind if i began to destroy tons of tons and peers and peargician and other exciting forms of didagoggits .
so , in fact , the fact is that you remember the 20th century , in 300 years , not for its wars or technological innovations , but rather than a era where we were , and the massive destruction of the biodiversity and cultural diversity on earth , either has been passive or passively accepted . so this is not the change .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar &quot; avatar , &quot; which was writing the latest measured things in visual effects and computer generated effects in a whole new way , with realizing , realistic expressions of human expressions that were made by the medicines , and the main figures should be all of the cg . and the world should be cg .
i &apos;m likely to hear , the two nice girls are still there , i &apos;m probably going to hear the generation that has saved this bad image for this bad image , because i &apos;ve started to study tens of hundreds of thousands of unconscious machines already starting to study inherently in carrosy school , called technical school , i think they &apos;re doing today .
now , i &apos;d like to start with a example of someone who had a fragile answer to a fraction of my lecture , which was a story that was a report . &#91; unclear &#93; ... he said he had heard a sink , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and it was the end of the room that there was a terrible sound of the sound .
do you know ? i think you &apos;re going to allow one person to allow you to think that he &apos;s thinking , or she &apos;s like the vessel , like the sticks and the essence and the essence and the source of all the divine , creative , unknown , unknown , unmysterious mysterious mysterious , is a little bit of a bit of a new insight to ask you to get human mind .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time , the co2 is also saying , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in any co2 , i wish it &apos;s almost no carbon ; i wish that it would accept it , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheap than predictable . &quot;
it &apos;s actually this thing that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who say , we had two reflections in two different surfaces , and he decides what he &apos;s supposed to choose , then the chosen that &apos;s chosen , the memory that &apos;s got less and that &apos;s the surgeon , and that &apos;s the surgeon that &apos;s going to be chosen .
you know , they all know the healthy crimes , if you give a secret of the best cost of the price , even though this one is scared , and then you get wiped and you get the best friend and the best friend of my friend and a terrible discussion , if you take a certain discussion , but if you make a certain bit of bad , you make a bad error that you never do it again .
you know , one of the great reassures of travel to travel and one of the freudian research in ethnography is in common with the people who can still remember the old days . the past is still looking at the wind , and they still feel a glorious disk in the searching of the plants .
if you &apos;ve ever got the chance to work in your urban center center , like our scotty silence of scott in the program -- in fact , they &apos;re all doing this -- you can see that people who call the government a lot of different problems , including a threshold in their house .
in fact , the nice thing is that if you do that , you do agriculture , agriculture , biogas , producers , on a hectar country with fifth ances in favelas in favelas , so that he can wait for about a hundred dollars a hundred dollars a hundred dollars , and you wait for the facility , and a chick of vegetable and vegetable and vegetables and vegetables .
and i think we &apos;re at the threshold of the threshold , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think that hundreds of years ago , we need to go back 300 years ago to go back to a time to find a time in which we &apos;ve been fighting in the progress that we have about these things that are more triggering than right now .
so by changing color , so you can change color and helpless and heroes to the individual images , photographed photographers , like the depths , the depths , the depths , the depths of color colors , and disorders , we hide the boundaries between the boundaries and how they look at a picture , even though there can be a picture of hundreds of thousands of characters .
if i would ask a room full of colleagues in a room full of colleagues and ask their sovereign support , and tell them what i &apos;ve just told you , i would probably not be able to achieve the second story of the second story before it would be really unpleasant , somebody would change a joke that would forget the rest and forget the rest of it .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn your hearing device , take your personal communication device -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can look at a real-school book that &apos;s not being wrong , because there &apos;s nothing in this talk for you .
a few years ago , the laser prize was given to shinya shyan acuan asked for his research in which he took a adult , a fiddle , a broader bladder , and through manipulation of only four genes that are going to lead them to a plurigically stem cell -- a potential cell is able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do in a body cell .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve made all sorts of batteries that are made , looking at the cars , computers , cell phones , taps , lamps for lamps , everything i &apos;ve used with the amount of electronic energy that uses the world . i found out that all batteries that we might be able to produce less than 10 minutes .
now , let &apos;s go back to a step back to the big bang of the big bang 14 years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago , the first signature of living , maybe three to four years ago , on the earth -- the first hundreds of millions of organisms , perhaps as a million or a million years ago -- and then the species , which , in the last 30,000 years .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral acre , which eventually discovered in the computer with images of flickr success , and just give them emergency dame in flickr , and you &apos;re going to get pictures of men in the shirts and shirts on the currency , and so every one of these colorful rekets , which is a model of this model that was discovered as a model .
and yet , in this country , in this country , in the united states of south , we &apos;re making people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted to death , when the victims is white , when it &apos;s black , when it &apos;s black , it &apos;s 20 times higher , when the black and the victims are white in the same states -- in the world , in their bodies , in their bodies .
i once traveled with a boy 6,000 miles of chimps in china through south dose , and when i came to lingua , i came to lingua , i saw the face of the statistics where you hear 60,000 monthups that were turned out to be turned into a mile and 1.2 million people during the cultural revolution of the cultural revolution . while the cultural revolution were murdered by the cultural revolution .
and so , the idea is , now , if you have all sorts of problems in something that you have to invest in something that you have only later -- and that &apos;s not that investment is not so clear . in fact , the worst pc is not necessarily the worst case of scenario and there are people in the rich world looking at ipc , and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big deal .
we put the chromosome into the chromosome of micro-species . big , these two soundscapes are far away from how people and mice and mice . we gave some extra samples to choose this chromosome . we could destroy it with everybody to destroy all the proteins . and it was very amazing than we put it in a cell -- and we &apos;re going to appreciate our very , very appreciation -- we &apos;re going to estimate here .
margaret mead , the big anthropologist said before she died that it &apos;s the biggest fear that as we move forward in a way that we move forward to the outside world , generosity , we don &apos;t just move the entire bandwidth of human imagination in a way , but we would see that one day in a dream , and we &apos;ve ever forgotten that there was ever other possibilities .
and i &apos;d like to show you a pretty obvious data from noah sentences , and this is from a early prototype of photosync photosynchrth that we &apos;ve been working in summer to show you what i think it &apos;s really the pointing technology that &apos;s behind this technology , and this is not so obvious when you look at the environments that we have the website on the website .
in other words , in other words , sugar pills have shown a measurable effect , the placebo effect , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what &apos;s happening with her , a pharmaceutical pharmacy or a kind of paintings , for example , for example , if there &apos;s only enough patient believes in the body that you call the placebo of the placebo effect .
now , when one said no , it was the vetie cattle , which has been a very crumbling , and i &apos;ve got 10 years tied for 10 years to doubt if i had my great engineer , maybe i could spend a great engineering on a real time , because all of my colleagues were always talking about my colleagues , you &apos;ve talked about the money on the window to the window of a child .

usually my role is to explain to people how wonderful technologies are coming out of the new technologies that are going to come up , and i thought i &apos;m here under friends , i &apos;m here under friends , i &apos;m going to tell you what i &apos;m really thinking about . and also trying to understand what &apos;s going on here , and what &apos;s going on with this really incredible jump , which is , which is how we can &apos;t be able to be able to get along with mithmithsters .
and that would be your answer to the bjr borg borg argument that if you use all of these time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals that are decreasing , the reduction of malaria , and so on , that it &apos;s a shock of resources , it &apos;s a waste of money , while there &apos;s better things that we can do .

this made me a different person than my friends under the kwal , who believe that this forests of humility and humility and the boarding hide hide hippies and the tunnels are the whales of balancing , the norman in the northroom of the world , who would be involved in their favor of sadness . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ;
a week ago , a week before a week ago , the national academy of academy engineering engineering is called the dragis of francis and wild array and wilderness , two scientists , two scientists who developed the independence of independent techniques to encourage the natural evolution to work faster , and to take a despair of protein values in a protein , which is called &quot; the direct evolution of &quot; humanity . &quot;
and now , in biology , and right now in biology , and i want to take this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , comes from biology biology , that biology is actually a science of information , because the n.n.a code is a abstract code , which is not just as much as it is , because it &apos;s dynamic matter , because it &apos;s really matter , so it &apos;s real , it &apos;s real , and it &apos;s not only .
so , bruce bruce bruce brown brown , a well-designed design researcher at the brightest university university , has gone so far as to say that these mass media , linked the book , and the image , not the image , the internet , etc . , etc . and so on and so on , what we call mass media is that these mass media is that these mass media restoring and our ability to have virtual ted .
i &apos;m sure that chris and really , some happy people and firms and companies and companies and profits and profits , and profits , the opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure that chris anderson will never let me go back to namson -- the rights will be able to buy the right to the talk that you just saw at the point where you didn &apos;t have a lot of content and didn &apos;t have a lot of content , which was actually what the subject was going to be .
and this phrase of this sentence from the exception of envelope to the idea that success is successful or happiness depends on a challenge , not to prepend up with the interconnectedness of the interconnectedness , but as if my life was so successful , because i could deal with a prosthetic life with a prosthetic life , or whatever people could perceive me with my disability .
and when these guys came and looked at these people , and who was the best proteins in the world , this was not a professor professor , not a tech student , she was not a tech student , it was somebody from england , a man chester , a woman who was a woman who was working on the business assistant to work in a business clinic and worked on the best proteins of the world at night .
so , of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. p.p. so i &apos;m going to do the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the view that the perspective was that fifth grade fifth grade girls in the second hospital , but he actually brought me to see me , in my practice , to see my usual horror horror horror , so a new experience of seeing a new experience and a new experience of experience .
and i &apos;ve been trying to do this for the past year while i &apos;ve been looking for the past year to do this , i &apos;ve also tried to find out in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they might be able to see better or better ideas about how to help us deal with the creative risks that are connected to creativity .
so we have a situation where we &apos;ve moved to a situation where we continue to continue our science , so we have to stand so much more , that these categories that we thought we were more stable for iconic categories , which were very simple , very simple , to create a very simple dna crease to create unidentified calories , much more than we have .
so i went home , so i went home and i went home with my wife , and i told her everything , and we thought , &quot; well , wait a second , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to control your eyes , then we should find a way to control a way that he can do that he can do it again , that he could be awesome . &quot; well , it would be awesome . &quot;
and so there &apos;s different , and so there &apos;s different , but the beautiful thing about it is that there &apos;s a million times as much energy as we have , as we say , a coal molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , and if you can deal with the problems , and the radiation , the cost of the footprint , the potential , the potential , the potential to the country , and almost different things in your own .
from the medical standpoint , of course , you can say that my legs , the laser surgical surgical surgery , cranking cameras from titan and artificial hubs for aging bodies that allow people to actually use all their possibilities and the limits to develop them beyond their natural destiny , not to create personality of people , to form themselves , to create a way of their own , and to define their own groups around the world .

and we &apos;re doing a series of travelers in the ethnosphere , where we &apos;re taking our audience to places like this cultural whales that they &apos;re going to be able to be able to contemplate from the laws of ourselves , and hopefully , and hopefully , after one of the other centers of the open anthropologist -- that this is that this world has made this difference in different ways that we can find a way to find a variety of culture in a really cultural logic world , that people can come from all the well-being .
one of them is made by one of them , by the great choice of saldor address , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect , and it &apos;s perfect , and which is it , which is perfect address ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made another decision . and what happened is this alternative to make sure that you make the decision , and that you made that you have made the negative decision , and that you have made the negative , and that you have made it a good decision on your own .
and at the end of this amazing initiation , they &apos;re going to be taken out after a day , and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 years , you see a sunset . and in this crystal moment of consciousness , when the sun begins to punk on the beautiful landscape of the landscape , everything you &apos;ve learned in the abstract of abstract abstract abstract abstract , what you &apos;ve learned in the abstract abstract abstract abstract , and i &apos;m telling you , &quot; how do you really tell you ? &quot;

so i started to emphasize as a computer scientist -- inspired by the way of our interactions with real objects -- together with my apprator and my colleague of jeevan jeevali , i started to wonder : what if we could use the computer , instead of a mess , like a fingertitup on a finger , how a fingertise would move on a flat surface , what if we could be able to interact with the hands and the hands , and how could we understand it ?
so i like to summarize that , i would like to summarize that for a time , my talk , and in the sense that the properties and the skills that we have made from the vocabulary age , and the ones that have gone a little bit like this are a little bit dispute in the machine that is called &quot; cyber , &quot; that we can be able to activated , and that we can actually be able to get back to this kind of technology , and we &apos;re not actually come back into the future of products , but in our new products .

now we all use , or many of us , or gaps , or one of their competitors , or one of their competitors , but these are particularly central states in the united states , like iran , where the dissidents of iran , like the foreign elevator , as you know , that you can &apos;t use more to be trusted as a local government , and that you can &apos;t be able to be able to move around the local government , so that they can &apos;t be trusted in their local government .
and i landed to people who are interested in nasa &apos;s space , and i ended up looking at people who are interested in space and who have been interested in nasa &apos;s space , and to do the nasa and understand the nasa in the ngos , and to sit through the realization , and to sit through space . they &apos;re walking around russia , they &apos;re walking around russian semics , and then they &apos;re going to fly away from the heart sector , and then we &apos;re flying through the space station , and then we &apos;re looking at our gramour-looking at the space station .

and when you go back to land , we had to go back and say , &quot; we &apos;ve got to do it , the fiberglass , the fence , the impression , the whole , the whole technology , the whole technology , the technology , and the difficulty difficulty , the difficulty difficulty , the human achievement , when you can just explain , &quot; you just don &apos;t know , it &apos;s not like that , or something else that , and you never have to know it .
and wherever you see in the world , you will discover that these cultures are not underground . these are dynamic peoples that are living by the existence of living by the forces that are infected by the power of their capacity . whether it &apos;s going to be the unintended in the country in the country of the penestate of the land where they &apos;re not a sweet of a sweet of sweet of south asia , where the people who are now living by the people who are less likely to be able to see that the nearest , where they can see that they can see that they &apos;re in their southeless , where they &apos;re in the areas of mud to see that they can &apos;t see that they &apos;re in the nearest in the south africa , where they &apos;re in the areas of the areas of their sought of the areas of the areas of the areas of their land where they &apos;re actually , where they &apos;re more market , where they &apos;re in
