thank you .
from seattle ...
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s singing .
but it &apos;s about it .
don &apos;t find it .
yeah , hello .
we love innovation .
solar technology is ...
that &apos;s not ...
we were poor .
are all these ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
after a week .
great trick ?
that &apos;s what we were .
a few less .
and he says ...
we know that .
ta-da !
wait twice .
here &apos;s her .
that &apos;s fast .
you need time .
music as a language .
that &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... not yet .
thank you .
what a fish .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
that &apos;s efficient .
wonderful , wonderful ?
totally inefficient .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much .
hunter : yours .
the only opportunity .
not a hospital too .
thank you very much .
stephen watts .
three out of 10 .
that was incredible .
thank you . thank you .
yeah , it &apos;s kind of like .
it &apos;s terrible .
for a while , yeah .
fantastic , right ?
the sun goes to the sun .
oh my god .
we love entertainment .
let &apos;s move off .
after home where ?
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we lose them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
there &apos;s a lot of stuff .
sounds good ?
the whole environmental discussion .
sounds familiar , what ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
that &apos;s great .
that was fascinating .
can i be honest ?
the farm is incredible .
what did you do ?
robert gupta .
that &apos;s the system .
this is what &apos;s going on .
yeah , good day .
lento , slowly .
this is all interested in me .
we can do that .
what do you say ?
not very sustainable .
yeah , milliseconds .
that &apos;s our present .
they have similar principles .
yeah , good day .
good work ! yeah !
just do your job .
this was the result .
thank you very much .
and she did .
so they meet al .
it &apos;s essential .
they &apos;re all important .
very different term .
it &apos;s incredibly exciting .
that &apos;s actually me .
it &apos;s poetry .
yeah , that goes .
flying cat .
this is the last one .
can we change it ?
these days are over .
these people deserve money .
what happened here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
assuming it again .
and that &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know .
central centers have been built .
what happened here ?
but you know what ?
what was the result ?
i was amazed .
it &apos;s generic .
so they knew everything .
you could see manhattan .
here &apos;s the video .
it has sensors .
why not live longer ?
he opens the door .
just a few more .
that &apos;s very good .
oh , so the one .
there &apos;s no normal .
yeah , i know .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
but you know what ?
i have a question .
okay . thank you .
i stood up to him .
don &apos;t sit around .
so you can do that .
they &apos;re bad . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work .
what do these people need ?
i don &apos;t think that .
i thought about it .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
they use their hands .
so how does this work ?
how interested they are .
that would have been okay .
what are media today ?
you can go in .
so where do we go ?
so it &apos;s true .
how do we know that ?
because you know what ?
it &apos;s not a country .
why do we do that ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
bg : thank you .
this is a wish .
and i was an artist .
let &apos;s call it a don &apos;t .
not school management .
and that has to go back .
we can do it differently .
they even do raw .
and i understand that .
a tremendous challenge .
there &apos;s no food .
it &apos;s against justice .
but the wrong things .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
i &apos;m a writer .
here &apos;s another example .
i forgot kids .
it feels great .
i swear it .
i wonder .
it &apos;s not going to do that .
thank you very much for listening .
why should we do that ?
thank you .
here &apos;s an example .
you see it immediately .
it &apos;s not toxic in .
but i kept working .
or before bombs .
i &apos;ll go in here .
there are two options .
we need energy miracle .
why does this happen at all ?
oh . oh , one moment .
i want to tell you .
what do you want to do ?
this is what happens to us today .
and i worked on .
so she was back .
and that &apos;s how it was .
yeah , this is it .
i agree with you completely .
and why is that ?
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what would it have to be done ?
i mean the soul .
you compare the same thing .
in china , it was different .
luckily , right ?
but that &apos;s not protection .
you &apos;ve got pee opportunity .
does anybody see something particular ?
and i always had it .
very expensive mobilization .
people were playing crazy .
what creates the illusion ?
my gut feeling again .
after just a journey there .
first of all , constraints .
i created one .
yeah . all right . all right .
think of the camera .
jk : both of them .
but it gets worse .
this is where you see it .
thank you very much .
be a mentor .
maybe 10 times as many .
but it didn &apos;t have it .
the data came in .
this is a great question .
i will never forget it .
it has billions of them .
have you seen these guys ?
but there &apos;s something else .
here &apos;s another example .
is it photography at all ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
ohhh .
and then it became international .
there were remixes .
let me summarize .
okay , a few more .
the answer to that is no .
just go on . a lot of fun .
my name is amit .
he had the experience .
it keeps you fresh .
this is a great question .
is that your opinion ?
a almost identical structure .
and it became better .
that &apos;s what she was doing .
it enjoys him very much .
here you see the city .
good afternoon , all together .
am i going to like the color ?
ooh , thank you .
some have come and gone .
i think that &apos;s not what i think .
dk : 60,000 .
there &apos;s an old study .
don &apos;t be disappointed .
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s not true of emotions .
it &apos;s called paul open .
now what do you believe ?
who will make it safer ?
first we have the population .
i don &apos;t like that question .
but what does your fish eat ?
let &apos;s call it a don &apos;t .
this is the model .
the work of the interprets .
but where are we useful ?
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
how do we actually work people ?
... his own story invent .
i will never forget that .
so , what does that mean ?
now , what does that mean ?
private sphere needs to be there .
there are online criminals .
we have three main groups .
it was still fish .
he always showed up here .
and then it happened again .
i felt really good .
and a lot of people forget this .
crisis . death . disaster .
it would be intangible .
it &apos;s not our fight .
it &apos;s not our problem .
we lost the contact .
why not think that way ?
we love technology and creativity .
it would be inspiring .
we regret each other .
and this opens up a map .
but what do we do with this ?
that &apos;s about it .
what am i looking at ?
his name is tempt .
will it have my size ?
that sounds crazy , right ?
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
we need to spread the message .
that &apos;s what most people know here .
you also have to understand that .
this is what you see down there .
i want to ask you something .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and luckily , he didn &apos;t die .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was destroyed on the ground .
they look like this .
is it about the light ?
i grew up in india .
this is the shortcut .
you see the water coming .
i had a good life .
so what happened for years ?
who are these relatives ?
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
these changes are in the room .
how about fitness ?
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
but the key thing is , ...
he &apos;s working on the following thing .
and then they put them up .
what &apos;s actually happening there ?
the orange contractor .
they really loved it .
but i felt bad .
the two smells helped me .
woman : legendary technology .
very scary .
what &apos;s the soul ?
we &apos;re not producing ourselves anymore .
i can claim it all .
he went up and down .
what else can we do ?
this is what the chart looked like .
i &apos;m going to get to the end .
maybe that &apos;s the reality of reality .
it sounds kind of miserable .
we were 20 people .
so we &apos;re too many .
you can &apos;t have bones .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
or is it possible ?
conflicts emerge from conflicts .
so what do we need to do ?
they didn &apos;t have the books .
this is felix .
actually , i made two mistakes .
thank you for your attention .
that was the beginning of the journey .
i &apos;m honored with awe .
and then everybody went down .
they saw the big impact .
first of all , second .
well , i was the next one .
let &apos;s say , who &apos;s normal ?
and finally , epic meaning .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
the same thing , just bigger .
who &apos;s most successful ?
you want to feed the world ?
i wanted to support them .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
i just loved two .
one place is south korea .
again , you have it again .
this is such a natural thing .
my wife told me .
and how did that feel ?
that &apos;s what you can train .
does it make you curious ?
so it &apos;s a circle .
so what now is hacking ?
this is what happened around christmas .
what &apos;s the thing for a thing ?
so , you know , you know .
you could have better do it .
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
i don &apos;t have to worry .
and that &apos;s nothing else .
is that reasonable ?
so this is the good news .
it was a huge success .
so they saw something magical .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
but can &apos;t be a problem .
they always say , why ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
it was just not invented yet .
novelty was going to work yet .
does anybody know what this is ?
for example , this perception of context .
this is a game outside .
this is god , you know ?
but it was very sad .
so let me remind you .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
and it &apos;s the x .
sometimes i go too much .
but they do the job .
and they connected these two people .
her mother moved her on her own .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
think about your own decisions .
this picture is from this place .
i see this plussible .
and it took 18 months .
tell me about this world .
this is very risky .
and that worked very well .
again , he showed him four .
i learned everything .
and there are hundreds of them .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there &apos;s good news .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
that made me really sad .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
but that &apos;s not so fast .
how can we help you ? &quot;
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
no , no , no , has been an opportunity .
the story is not over .
what happened on this day ?
well , we want to do it .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
that &apos;s how good you feel . &quot;
they come from the artists .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t say that .
the power plant can explode .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
she did it for three years .
you can have these cloud .
the data was not available before .
game is not silly .
now , how could that happen ?
is this all just education ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
so , we can do that too .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
game doesn &apos;t just mean child games .
and that was 19 years ago .
what would you like most ?
they create a epic story .
they have so much uncertainty .
the data is all the time .
nobody ever said that before .
so paul is a terrorist .
and this is what he actually says .
don &apos;t take anything you &apos;ve been there .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what should our creature look like ?
this is a lot of volume .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
i &apos;ll almost never do it with it .
she was back and forth .
and of course , that &apos;s incredible .
and here &apos;s the attitude .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
an autistic student .
if it &apos;s the garbage right now .
so not like detox .
and we take it all on it .
we depend on two countries .
everybody needs a goldfish glass .
let &apos;s be here . &quot;
people were still happy .
it was my first sunset .
actually , he collected fish .
my name is brian goldman .
they share their experiences with others .
the white lines stand for population .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
he showed up on the algae .
that &apos;s simply not technological .
there are four and a half thousand people living there .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
every waste is nutrient .
and so we &apos;re too many .
so the question is , how ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and it was an incredible experience .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
but there are two problems in this .
i started to feel better .
but , you know what ?
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
that was , but that was grandiodio .
i talk a lot about these questions .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
this is it , very simple .
we &apos;re in a field .
and that &apos;s what we did .
basically , they do the same thing .
this is now one of the images .
what other markers act like this ?
and then something weird happened .
you can play with different kinds of games .
the whole building was made of water .
italy wins . yeah .
in the morning , in front of the game .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
the creativity had to somehow go out .
today , it &apos;s all easy to have .
the nurse asked the nurse .
i shouldn &apos;t probably do that .
maybe even in our cell phones .
and it starts with a doctor .
i &apos;m going to tell you something .
we use the energy of the sun .
this is all the metadata .
i can say everything .
it will always be similar to you .
but slowly , it took itself .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
what are you trying to do ? &quot;
further than that , we don &apos;t go .
what lessons have we learned ?
and the form plays a role .
you can &apos;t store energy .
then i can translate this whole thing .
okay , that makes you really courage .
once we started a vibrant .
my second mistake was worse .
and they come up with a 257 .
we all love baseball , right ?
somehow the kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
this is about five feet long .
they &apos;re going to be free to the computer .
because here &apos;s somebody masks ?
and then realizing it .
below others shouldn &apos;t suffer things .
this has the largest impact .
the movement , to write it .
anyway , not to navigate .
and that &apos;s all in the beginning .
the truth is more like this .
do you want to do jewelry ?
this is how you can &apos;t do anything .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
their family gathered together .
thank you very much for your patience .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
what else is risky ?
be just who you are .
i remember my first fire .
what &apos;s a story called a story ?
it &apos;s dark in dark . dark .
i was trying to do something spanish .
but it &apos;s very effective , right ?
but we need the whole thing .
nuclear missions , yes ?
that &apos;s totally incorporous .
let &apos;s take the quiet .
hmmm , my brand ?
this is scary .
that sounds frightening .
next : nuclear energy .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
i wanted to be normal at the time .
this is what i &apos;m going to show you now .
once the judge looked at me .
we can &apos;t just do that .
so i went to the court .
i got something fear of technology .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
and there are several reasons for this .
they sell certificates .
but it &apos;s not documented .
why did i go to medicine ?
it can know where we are .
it spreads from race .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i like things that are different .
i went to prison -- difficult .
this didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
this is a car game , right ?
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
and this video is in real time .
the game starts -- swiss .
you can &apos;t have any teeth .
what about longevity ?
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
so the correlation is gering .
so , look what happens .
it &apos;s really changed the dynamics .
so i just started playing .
and then we said , okay .
yeah , these are the data .
i &apos;ll shoot something through my head .
have you ever been disgusting ?
that &apos;s like learning to happen .
because for me , it means memory .
how and what has he recommended ?
we say in germany .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
music is medicine . music changes us .
it turns out it &apos;s really hard .
and you know what i learned ?
these are going to be disgusting .
but what will happen in the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and this is a very simple question .
this has nothing to do with science .
and that can make a big difference .
but there &apos;s another reason .
anyway , we need a solution .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
that &apos;s what i hear about , thank you very much .
they fluid the canoes .
in the assumption , maybe two percent .
we started this 15 years ago .
how far do you get there ?
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
you know what &apos;s neither ?
so the first step into a interpretation .
and still , it &apos;s not a interpretation .
this must be the difference of aging .
if you come to that , yes ?
you can show me , i was there .
that &apos;s just the minimum .
we can get our nutrients back .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
on the book and on the picture .
this picture reminded me of something .
i find them off .
sunlight and co2 is a method .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
and what does this mean for the designers ?
i want to prove that to you .
it was a pretty fate project .
this is what he &apos;s leaving the sun .
this is the storage .
these rivers take a go .
a has these benefits and risks .
our magazines are read by millions .
lego made it possible for everybody .
private sphere is not the debate .
they were genetically engineered .
i &apos;m the new doctor .
i don &apos;t take the same lost .
baseball is full of great statistics .
because we live on a water planet .
do we really want to go to this direction ?
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
and these are the neural structures .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
oh , my time is over ?
there &apos;s something left in me .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
so we measured his movement .
this is a picture of the object .
apparently it was very popular .
you see something fun here .
i really like to like beautiful clothes .
it can only use its eyes .
but the truth is far away .
you can do that all the time .
so this crazy story could be voices .
who would ever have a wish ?
the defeat would have just been too simple .
her father died shortly after her birth .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a cents .
we need to increase the complexity slowly .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
so here &apos;s your margin .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
but then they really want deep inside .
you want to orient in the museum ?
that was more concrete .
okay , you really want to know that ?
and i had to go out of the city .
we won some prices .
who doesn &apos;t want to be healthier children ?
it makes shareholder in children .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
no , i mean it really serious .
i hold the knife in my hand .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;ll shoot my sleeve back .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
now i see greg lemoon .
a billion people are going to starve today .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
i loved myself from this fish .
no , no , that &apos;s not going .
and this sounds very different than before .
he was already over sixth .
i started a institutional institute .
they even get funded with a funding .
the movie hasn &apos;t been done yet .
we need to think about what marks are .
what do you do with that ? &quot;
i call that the close-up .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
this is ideology , not science .
and that brought me through like this .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
it &apos;s very simple , so it &apos;s going to come .
it &apos;s going to be busy .
the hot projections today .
automatically , he runs to the right idea .
these are the natural things that are done .
but it requires a lot of planning .
we can reinvent it all the time .
in how we think of north .
and it depends on phosphorus .
often in the third one , again , forget .
longer than those other two networks .
the stones are coded .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
it &apos;s about changing values .
i started with my usual talk .
this is a very sensitive question .
i learned that from my grandmother .
now we do this with airplanes .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
we haven &apos;t written this app .
and every morning i jumped on it .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
they &apos;re very good at each other .
in which words , would you describe ?
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
there are also worlds .
to ask , what &apos;s the right thing ?
people over the uranium .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
the living bears the mind .
they gave her blood pressure up .
thank you , but the best thing is .
we &apos;ve reached an equilibrium .
happy productivity . fantastic !
the result of it was catastrophic .
and everybody in this room has to come in .
here &apos;s the olive oil spill .
bjorn sundane .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of procedures .
this is going to be going to open up with this .
my brother stared at me .
this is the apple saras .
i talked a lot about magic .
who could have looked at all of this ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who do you really want to inform with this ?
completely targeted to a particular goal .
what do you think happens next ?
they have them . they always have them .
so this is a hard one .
it &apos;s a constant increase in the world .
they literally designed the levers .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
i hope you forgive me .
especially when he died , you know , he &apos;s died .
so there are two circles of circles .
the byproduct is clean water .
it sounds unusual for the first time .
we built unique elements here .
you always lose rare animals .
she &apos;s going to touch her deeply .
he died , broken through the story .
this is how the building works .
they went through each other .
let &apos;s say what you feel .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
let &apos;s do a little interpension .
here you have this little mechanism .
there he &apos;s signed up there .
the one who &apos;s interested in the fireman .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
students are divided to notes .
these things are logically correct .
and here you can feel it .
so for energy , i got this one .
i tried to understand them .
all these generations only need a few milliseconds .
and it seems that nobody seems to climb .
that i had written these crazy things .
so men can &apos;t be a pig .
this is just a little less destruction .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t get to learn .
this is also a paradigm shift .
a dalmatower , right ?
you &apos;ll first see from the back to the back .
so from modern society , the computer society .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
we have to get far , and we have to get fast .
it &apos;s about a new supply of america .
they &apos;re all very challenging questions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they &apos;re the healing countries of somebody .
we &apos;re going through initiational rituals .
now look at this curve .
widridrite is just about our lives .
i forgot people into death cells .
they kept us inspired by being inspired .
now , some mutations might be a couple of mutations .
so scott is going to get this fruit .
we worked up to the late night .
so i followed my gut feeling .
he moved back to the silence .
now we saw the reverse effect .
well , everybody has applaud .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
so ... so , not that optimistic .
he switches the legs off .
let &apos;s start with the perceive .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
they had a concept of blue blood .
i believed everybody could believe that .
i &apos;ve never met him personally .
even cats look at this video .
there was jimmy kimmigrant .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
how would you describe your brand ?
we talk about reef , fresh .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
no , that was what i thought .
i &apos;m a redundancy person .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
this is a painting of a circular painting .
the roof was also covered with water .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
and women argued that successfully .
we can support them to be good .
look at what she does .
the main man disappears to me .
sexual reproduction is moving into the picture .
i &apos;ll read you the entrance .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
that &apos;s the truth . i believe that .
we &apos;re talking about twenty of them .
it was really incredibly profound .
he shake his head , no .
this is going to happen in april next april .
we also have very accurate data .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
the mechanism comes from the gap .
but with the right design , please .
we can support them to be good .
just to say , what is information ?
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
there was never a time before like this .
and even lomg thinks about it .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
also , these winterruptions are the underground .
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
this is an ecological network .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
the chef had cook .
you put it like this box .
this is such a tragic part .
the thing that had just been represented .
what &apos;s going to take five million milliseconds ?
i see the dalmast .
it may be , until it &apos;s invited .
maybe you &apos;ve got to have a look behind it .
no , no , far away .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
156 nations send our tv channel .
they tap their internet connection .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
she wasn &apos;t drundrunk .
i &apos;m a person . i &apos;m making mistakes .
this is the system where we live .
but i continued to ask myself these questions .
and that was what i felt .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
you should also have the wishes .
something very strange happens here .
and that was the outbreak of the day .
i &apos;ve learned a couple of very simple things .
it can know how we hold it .
so it creates a feedback loop .
boston didn &apos;t just have a staff center .
this is a modest little app .
this is from another place .
&quot; they didn &apos;t let them go . &quot;
i lived in parallel worlds .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and i &apos;d like to read you the benefits .
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
you can be logically and intuitive .
tell me a little bit about this part .
make it possible -- all of you here .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
does anybody know what that is ?
so this is the reason for this project .
it &apos;s called &quot; i jumped with me . &quot;
let me tell you a little bit about it .
but the state of these kinds of things that we don &apos;t exist .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
we can give ourselves something like this .
so the first exciting primate .
and there &apos;s kind of a collaborator .
daniel kahman : sure .
everybody would like to make people happier .
and the dose also plays a role .
and why ? intelligent food changed .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
we have masses in this country now .
not even the truth is going to be free .
because now you can apply a three-sentence .
you see the timeline on the top .
in many cases , these people are totally healthy .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
but it &apos;s not just the words .
thank you , danny kahman .
we get an absolutely flat line .
what does this look like here ? pretty good .
because we don &apos;t want to go wrong with genes ?
we don &apos;t want seeds to have companies .
the guy in the middle is not that much .
they lead the process , they understand it .
there are a lot of things that need to come together .
and what do you do with the trash ?
bad ? i was completely confused .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and then he can walk away from that .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
his personal impressions of the seafood .
i &apos;m trying to do this for a while .
it &apos;s got to work first as a present .
but we start to see a change .
this is a year of water diving flow .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
now this level of intuition is going to be very important .
so littlete is open source .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
they grow up to five inches .
maybe i did it with good reason .
&quot; a pale blue . &quot;
let &apos;s take a look at something else .
it all comes from our own bags .
normal people are not accessible . &quot;
as an artist , it &apos;s very important to me .
here you see roberto dancing .
and no matter , italy won the end .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
but the game is a formal transformation .
thank you . i have a question to you .
he had had 20 minutes of music .
well , then i &apos;ll show it to you .
that &apos;s just a insurance method .
it should reveal the two elements .
shake the environment , less waste .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to talk about .
yeah . you don &apos;t do anything else than discover .
the goal of the movie is transparency .
a language is the expression of the human mind .
it was an acoustic bark .
what you need is a new medical culture .
alone , damaging and without support .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
i think our identity is threatened .
many of my mandela are very young .
my cousins all over the place .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
here are two different jewels .
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i &apos;ve got it on my laptop here . &quot;
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly to act .
a whole peaceful whip food .
the difference then is perceived as loss .
in two hours , they &apos;re building all over the place .
the emergency room had all the strands of shelf .
no insurance can be created .
there are a lot of great books to this topic .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputer .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
you can predict that . why is that ?
what kind of action do i do ?
it &apos;s great that this number is going up .
isn &apos;t half a quarter or a quarter ? &quot;
so what can we conclude from all of this ?
so basically , a translation of translation .
no tree is carbon neutral .
and further , now you &apos;ll see him .
the next step is now happening within this communities .
he had plenty of natural videos .
this is actually just the process of working .
two minutes later , three things happened .
thank you very much , very much .
so , he &apos;s here . right there .
that really triggers the fuel problem .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
this is one , part of her .
it just didn &apos;t happen before , you know ?
in other areas -- the world of communication .
this is my supermarket . no big deal .
but western governments also help themselves .
sleeping lack is ubiquitous .
i &apos;m going to be tired of how we all do .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
if you burn coins , no .
say , there &apos;s no prediction .
can you play them now in blue ?
no , we &apos;ll figure out what &apos;s inside .
and there &apos;s a central point in this .
you know , everyone was eating cow .
that &apos;s what the norm says about it .
now , what &apos;s the archaeical models ?
and the list is , you can continue to continue .
so , that was my primary motivation .
it &apos;s new america . find out more .
and the problem is not the technology of itself .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we wondered , and nobody knew it .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
monday : color is something powerful .
it has a sense of serendipity .
and then it looks like this .
do you remember the winds even ?
so , help me a little bit about that .
imagine mozart &apos;s kind of efficient .
i &apos;m happy that i &apos;m there .
the amount of water has distorted .
it &apos;s what we &apos;re doing for it .
man 3 : i &apos;m the museum of the museum .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a lip .
in fact , the instruments have evolved the instruments .
i want to explain this a little bit about a little bit .
in fact , no viral video wanted to make a viral video .
in this three-sentence , three sentences come in front of them .
three sentence is what you still know from school .
you can zoom in very easily and zoom in .
now i add a bass to it .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
if you don &apos;t , somebody else today .
this is the machine below genius .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
they laughed more than they do here .
your problem is that you have too little .
three : escalation of expectations .
the official dogma of what ?
they &apos;re just listening , and then they start talking .
let me show you how they work .
it &apos;s a game called the following .
i call them &quot; the income billion . &quot;
we &apos;re thinking about energy today .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
you go around and you kill yourself .
you just have to spread as far as possible .
think of an airplane as well .
this is something built in the city .
second period of time . the normal game of time .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
just imagine that for a moment .
raise your hands . let me see .
maybe we can see vibration as change .
dumb is not much better .
people were fighting . people were fighting .
and let &apos;s start with one example .
you know that science is not a company .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so , that really struck me .
i tried to preserve the body .
life had not changed since centuries .
but for so many years , the aid came to help .
my grandmother never forgotten me his life .
my fourth technique : predictability for complexity .
the third technology : categorization .
it tends to be a thousand square kilometers .
you get to two because of it -- very simple .
you want to tell me something about my brand .
it was something that we knew to do .
but reality is always unpredictable .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
donneresday : confidence is the key .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
i wanted to restore the health of a disease .
now , if you think about it a little bit .
what ? that really made me flip out .
we reject genetic food .
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
we have them forced them . puff .
my parents are the 80 on the ferences .
and there &apos;s the storage problem .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drinking information . &quot;
you can jump directly to a particular copy .
you can dive into a particular year .
because that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing , right ?
shake the environment , less energy .
that &apos;s what &apos;s called the osic model .
now look at the dalmast .
and the two final ones are also here today .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
this has to go down to zero , to zero .
i didn &apos;t let myself out of it , but i didn &apos;t disagree with it .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
and in time , you can react to other people .
our goal was to just say , okay .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go a little bit further .
all of this is compotent of it .
it &apos;s all that &apos;s in it , it &apos;s useful .
this will be trained in china in a second .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
anyway , they do this in every case .
the thumb is marked with red .
and if you don &apos;t , you know , your dance .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
seriously -- the interrupted !
now , this cartoon makes some say .
here &apos;s a few on the hampton .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
i thought i could integrate myself .
we still think they &apos;re still originally .
the three words said , do you remember ?
i remember it was yesterday .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
now , i went to the hall of the room .
i said , &quot; ok , oma . &quot;
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition point .
i work in the solar economy .
and let me show you a simple example .
but it has an unexpected waste .
so that made sense , it was passing together .
yet we seem to be quite satisfied with that .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
scott entertainment was from a human being .
and here &apos;s every piece of this very well planned .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
is it about the detail or the color ?
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
nobody has to give ideas to green light .
motors , gear -- four options .
i think i might have heard more hands .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
eeeeeeee ! no , thank you !
and this is a millionaire concert .
so at this point , we need digital security systems .
so again , the most real good together .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
sexual sexuality comes in a lot of different forms .
so they go off ; they save the shoes .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years here .
what we want to do is create the future .
i &apos;m not going to be in the real life of this feedback .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching .
let me show you just from the point of view .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
protect mend . complain .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
they were just like the people in this room .
my grandparents put this number on 70 .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
we need to spend more research on the research .
there &apos;s every footprint there .
i usually would take the needle out .
there is somebody sitting in the back , who had no childhood .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand that .
if we did that , we would have a machine here .
what do you believe with these design students ?
this is going to be a key element of this perceptual element .
they live with help of chemosynthesis .
i was absolutely thrilled , you know .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
and every night , they fly 240 miles back .
every morning they fly 240 miles to the farm .
how is the futurity ? &quot;
natural light then offers smarter .
that &apos;s what nobody has done on the world .
picasso says , wait , just wait .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
that the theme of ecology is a global one .
now i &apos;m going to do something else to do this .
now you &apos;re all back to your way back .
and they had to remove what we did .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we just signed up .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
so you can &apos;t get them wrong around .
what do you do with certificate ?
this is alfred trizalez .
there can be a sequence of changes .
and this is very important in the medical research .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
what would you say to somebody who believes this ?
then he got me to the ear .
the rest of the time , they &apos;re deleted .
i start playing with some simple examples .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
the question is , why people accept that .
and i got back to work .
it &apos;s connected to oxygen and silicon .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
and then i wonder , how could this happen ?
first of all , i thought that would be a game .
the storytelling needs more and more senses .
and trying to do that again with another generation .
today , a lot of people gave up the government .
the next week , this is coming to the market .
she has a button , she has a button .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
i mean , no one has ever seen a particle .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the performance .
the first is a classic , apple .
it &apos;s the way i like to be .
these things have a positive impact .
no one wanted to do something about the film .
what do you believe how the answer is going to be ?
on the left-hand side , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s why i think we need to be leaders .
so we have this terrible idea .
so two pairs , every tedster , a baby .
ladies and gentlemen , their relations .
it &apos;s the only test of survival and success .
the teacher didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
it was hah beyond the imagination .
but the best thing is -- in a second .
so each concert is a different concert .
so not saving , distorted , avoid .
and everything is packaged or content .
i could be in front of my house . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
it supports other people talking about their mistakes .
i hired them , and i went to the treatment .
do you know what you call a 4,000-page ?
notice two things about this curve .
and i have to say , there were power to me .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
at 16 , i started to illustrate books .
that our contribution to the system is choosing .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
it &apos;s not even in other countries .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
i never want to make anything different in life .
so i spoke to some months later at a conference .
this is how they communicate -- this is how their fingers go along .
i want to show you something very first here .
and of course , it &apos;s done it .
it was summer , and i got there .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
and they &apos;re not only going to die of masks .
what happened is that we could do that .
they don &apos;t invest time in power .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . i put up .
these are absolutely logical and correct .
anyway , that &apos;s what i want to do .
technically , technological circles are the same .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge to nine .
i put it in particular .
at the beginning , the tribal society is the language .
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
so you want to go from the outside to the people .
we don &apos;t have identity , we invent it .
it was a lot of time , and i was in iron .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
now everyone &apos;s trying to detect some of this pattern .
he came to me and hugged me .
all of them were like that , they started sharing .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you do that crazy ?
the country on the land would roll you up .
so smartphone , a giant topic everywhere .
and we want to make this material available for all of us .
in my work , i &apos;ve learned very simple things .
we want something against death penalty companies .
there &apos;s a couple of interesting developments there .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet , there is a realistic level of realization .
so , the theme of the day : financial saving .
actually , no , that was not the mistake at all .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
and we have to do a lot of work on this device .
it happened four and a half years ago in italy .
and i &apos;m saying that this is good .
this is a problem that many players have .
for the last three of the five , i put it together .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model instead .
memory these , triggers the rest .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
all right , what &apos;s the brand germs ?
i want to help you calm up .
both of them are survivors , both of them .
as i said , amanda carries our elephants .
there was no canal melon .
have you taken all of your vitamins this morning ?
so this was a very strange experience .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
all around these windmills to make virtually virtuous .
information is a difference that makes a difference .
the only thing you had was your head .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
this is a dead turtle .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
i &apos;ve got something that i want to show you .
what would it be like to live in good health ?
we don &apos;t want companies to live .
and this is what i found incredibly exciting .
they have the flow of the water of the water .
so , we can &apos;t do these things at all .
in the countries where people come to money .
and what does it look like , because it &apos;s in there ?
we understood that the weather is global .
and in this head , the memory took off .
you &apos;ve seen it warm in the news .
this is a completely unsustainable development pattern .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
everyone in my living neighborhood is gone .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
there seems to be an uninadequate .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
now they understood the advantage of &quot; prototyping . &quot;
that &apos;s the u.s. economy for hundreds of years .
i think , first of all , is the curiosity .
the flargos eat the shrimp .
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
but maybe you can also agree with them .
but today we &apos;re only talking about the biological systems .
not all to be compatible .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
and we see that it &apos;s coming out of yellow .
because it &apos;s not that we feel real money .
yeah , so what &apos;s going to be biohacking ?
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
there are those who are much more spatial .
the headquarters are right here .
i thought he had kidney stones .
and back to my doctor &apos;s back to my doctor .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
we want to lower the number of crops .
the swiss is concrete .
the sound of dna was an interesting step .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
but what happens to &quot; shoot &quot; is different .
i was not familiar with the label .
no apple has ever looked like this .
good night , sweet rat . &quot;
now he &apos;s putting a tractor in the scene .
and they also feel their movements and their tendency .
if your job is dance , dance .
so we complained about 50 of the magnets of magnets .
this is footage about a thumb of six seconds .
but let &apos;s not always be that bad thing .
in our own countries , we would never do this .
they &apos;re going to be rare because we start them .
so you don &apos;t consume any benefits for the animals .
all of these things are unavoidable .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
i remember it as though it was yesterday .
and i &apos;m going to have a character in the book .
tell them , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
so each trunk was a little different .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
i put my job in 95 .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
we found that it really moves strange .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
the answer is probably going to be &quot; no . &quot;
you know , how many people look at these tedtalks ?
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
this is something like our champion .
so that you can pull the whole movement .
here &apos;s the results that we &apos;re getting right now .
but how do you do that in practice ?
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
i want to do it by not getting sterile . &quot;
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
that &apos;s the problem that i try to solve .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
and you say , what happens to those moments ?
... that the dosiblings also play a role .
probably many of you know this trick here in the room .
yeah , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
and i have all sorts of little props here .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
well , i understand that . i do that .
the marshmallow needs to be on the top .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
these blocks bring us no money to us .
i can put the sequence while it &apos;s going around .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
for nathaniel , music means semi-health health .
that &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
because in fact , this man is not interested in anything .
because we can &apos;t live without that lifespan .
he &apos;s just kidding them , and not himself .
why do i have to afford that little car ?
a phrase with its own breath .
it &apos;s not spoken at the beginning of the beginnings .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
it &apos;s sort of a mindset of stuff .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say that .
or they didn &apos;t have any kind of olithic gray .
and that all leads us to one of the big question ...
they virtual reality , and they don &apos;t quite have computers .
yeah , what do we do now ?
and the world in which we lived like this .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
if you generalize it , that &apos;s what happens .
and that wasn &apos;t hard to diagnose diagnosis .
i was an obsessional student .
all right , really good , maybe a all-star .
wealth , not debt , affecting the outcome .
she had the last word in every family .
the transition happens . we can feel it all .
and we use this word with such contemplation .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and that worked . applause for scott .
i met the decision to move into the united states .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times viewed .
and that was an experience in dehumiliation for me .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
this is just online -- no press , no tv .
or are you more likely to be a downtown ?
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
so what are we going to see in the movie ?
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve figured this out .
and that &apos;s the planning process behind it .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
each icberg has its own individual personality .
you don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
it &apos;s natalie , and it &apos;s just natalie .
we have the passion of a diy innovators .
that &apos;s moore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
we want to create mass incartiles . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i want to talk about the power of identity .
now we do that with drill and machines .
this is the edition center for service and information .
and we want to put this on a global scale .
we all have navigation systems in our cars .
but at the same time , we know that &apos;s not possible .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
all right , let me show you something more of it .
here we were , and this is the painting .
emempirics : welcome transparency .
there were lots of crazy things going on there .
from the bird age to machine age .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same in disabled movement .
but are we going to do the best of our game ?
8,000 players were playing the game for eight weeks .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
but one of them is worse than the other .
but you know what they don &apos;t have a right ?
i thought , let &apos;s take the poll right now .
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
and so i then met a little unusual decision .
so both of these have been digitized .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
i had a relationship with this beauty of several months .
i don &apos;t know who knows about this picture .
i &apos;ll just agree that &apos;s logical .
i think it seems important to verify one .
the question of death is an interesting question .
the kid in me is really excited about these possibilities .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
today , i &apos;m going to tell you about unexpected discoveries .
the underwater part comes from a stone break .
if i say reality , i &apos;m a reality reality .
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
and how was that for you ? what was it successful ?
a little bit more about you , that &apos;s not you .
it was &quot; eternity , forever . &quot;
tuesday : adaptation is totally overwhelmed .
the dog ! i was in front of language .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
she didn &apos;t go to breathing and was blue .
the people in the side of the room are now coming in .
but now you can &apos;t count my finger , right ?
you need that , and we don &apos;t give you .
and some of it doesn &apos;t work and mankind .
so we &apos;re running out of it , and where are we going ?
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace it .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
we wanted to develop a tool for language learning .
i may have another 40 years in me .
now you know what the answer to this question is ?
if you want to make it hyperlinks between the images .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not perceived as a great loss .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
this is the kind of educational shrimp .
there &apos;s also a lot of studies on this now .
we &apos;re learning trust trust and the rules of play .
probably , one of these numbers have to come very close to zero .
and i said , &quot; yeah , very happy . &quot;
you can say things that have influence around the world .
... can you show the slide for a minute .
just like , i think we &apos;re going to play a games today .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the need for a doctor .
and i went over and i just listened to .
it also turns out to be in other places of the book .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
these results have been achieved through several weeks of hard work .
this player &apos;s about a epic victory .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
there &apos;s a program that may be familiar with .
i &apos;m very grateful for the start here .
you probably know that he was in 1835 .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibility of it yet .
my mother lifted to nightmare from the boat .
these are the people who form my world view .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the border .
we see this in all kinds of human life .
and just as it was after the three months .
it &apos;s right , morality , patents .
the main problem here is similar to aids .
the logic doesn &apos;t say anything about reality .
it &apos;s a nice example of what it &apos;s like to do .
then i say , heartful , yes ?
and we often invent ourselves as often as we want .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing kids to the world .
his whole process of employment changed after that .
i said , &quot; promised , oma . &quot;
it &apos;s verifiable and strange programs .
the politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
but that &apos;s what this picture is , is a problem .
there are some places that we can turn to .
we called it the digital water digital lion .
because they have special skills of processing .
so here are some natural fireflies .
the second factor is the services we use .
it changed my way of making films , completely .
it &apos;s hard to overcome the destruction .
so you could feel comfortable with selling it .
this is the idea of how the soul does .
that means that ants weigh much more than we do .
and we can look at that now .
go and squeeg cows .
so , pull them off and start inventing them .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
that &apos;s an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
so just imagine two other little changes .
how many people would choose for a good memory ?
and that &apos;s how n the message is .
so please listen to you , if a music is played .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any statement about what &apos;s going on .
the first two sentences are logical .
in fact , we know that something else is the case .
now this is not supposed to be a joke , but it &apos;s a joke .
do that once , and then you experience the sentence .
we can do these things to different examples .
what we love to love is that it &apos;s a constituency .
they moved to a natural concept .
so these women met , and they just got down .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and we designed an ipad app .
darfur and spontaneous sponsors .
i want to tell you some of the pieces of the puzzle .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you zoom in . you can actually go in .
you can see in all these museums there .
how much money does it take to realize that ?
think about it . this attack is generic .
and if it doesn &apos;t , it doesn &apos;t do anything .
so we &apos;re starting with a wind-looking drum .
he says , &quot; make it to the printers . &quot;
imagine a sound airplane in front of you .
it &apos;s a totally illuminated by mistakes .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to continue to develop .
this is another look at the tree of life .
they shared the kingdom in two layers .
this is one of the classical expressions in play .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
we didn &apos;t have children yesterday in this country yesterday .
and i took a while to figure that out .
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
you have to be ready to take risks like this .
&quot; look at your belly , pink .
there &apos;s no overwhelming problem with trees .
and then you &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s given a change .
and the third area that explains is actually from itself .
i &apos;m looking forward to the conversations with them .
every big picture is the beginning of a cut .
you wouldn &apos;t like starvation , and you know what ?
or are you more like a downtown ?
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
this is the consequence that we have to ask .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
wednesday : surround your inner child .
play is the kitty that keeps us both .
if you give something to you , you &apos;ll give it right now .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
they teach them to open their own doors .
antarctica : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
and here are two patients . these are their records .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive cognitive leap .
i think that &apos;s true for everybody on the planet .
those who do scientific arguments are very little .
so , climate change is going to be terrible for you .
i &apos;ll just show you the new york times .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
it grows in the winter and ruins in the summer .
not just bad , but the worst ever ever .
everybody knew their genius was something laughtered .
we were regarding them , repaired them .
and the world in which we &apos;re now seeing life .
but these are all the streets in the u.s. s.a .
we dance in the temple and we become god . &quot;
child mortality has reduced a tenth .
this is also there , again , coming back again .
maniok , something that is half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
and you know what my answer to all of this is ?
we &apos;re going to go into the arms of the placebo industry .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
where is the biggest interest of what &apos;s really going on ?
and also , the energy source is very important for you .
we returned to the title of titanic .
because artists have a local ratio to lie .
and at all , you &apos;ve got a lot less than i do .
or b , because you don &apos;t learn to sing ?
i &apos;m never going to play anymore , like this moment .
it &apos;s the form of reform , yes ?
and less usable or user friendly is it .
how can i make a difference ?
i don &apos;t see why this shouldn &apos;t be like this .
so how do we work if we look in there ?
every society is pretended by a primarily medium .
and these interactive portraits are very aware of each other .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation of the fourth generation .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve made watermarks .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
you get a model that comes from all the earth .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
and she said the three words : don &apos;t you mind ?
the only problem with that was that she had 10 children .
so in other words , i definitely want what i want .
and i see the same process combining by photos .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it &apos;s been looked at almost 200 million times a year .
they had 348 different kinds of maria .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction to this .
paralysis is a sequence of many choices .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
he described one of them as very , &quot; ordinary . &quot;
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
on a site , the screen is filled with leaves .
so the ecological movement has done it .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
this year , it was taken almost 50 million times .
but what about this day , this particular day ?
i want to talk about the problem , and i want to talk about some possible solutions .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
we should put the bear in the cage .
are you eighteen and monthly like 007 ?
the life itself has no voice in this election .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
and in the world , everything made sense for me .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
dane , in a moment of head stocks .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
so gender can come up in a lot of different varieties .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
and no , it &apos;s not a conversation or san francisco .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open them doors ?
here &apos;s the latest version of this one-to-one .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
and that was sort of the first of people developed devices .
as a result , we &apos;re building more social relationships .
you never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen so rare lines .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
and the film is called &quot; the conviction . &quot;
now , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
well , we introduced the mayor hole .
now , today , we know everything about where our things come from .
frankly , you have a gate . italy makes you a tor .
how do you judge people because of their characteristics ?
now , chimpanzees are known for their aggressive .
he gives up every fifth hope from my mind .
is it true for others , or is it true ?
so i say , let &apos;s start the world changing games !
edward caova is an economist .
now we spend three billion hours a week playing online .
the biggest difference between you is the transition with time .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of automation .
bg : one energy breakthrough is the most important one .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t shake you yourself .
with pivot , you can dive into a decade .
but for many people , this is a little too radical .
so , in my life , i chanted a lot of fish .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
in fact , the notes are very vague and unprecisely .
because we &apos;re not going to do things more freely .
there &apos;s more to my glasses there .
as i said , there &apos;s only started .
this is an interactive film set of filters .
and wool√© ! for you , despite the fact .
i &apos;m still going to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and everybody knew it worked like this , right ?
i would keep going to do this work that i love .
and the question is , are these good news or bad news ?
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
here &apos;s , &quot; take your fingers on any light . &quot;
the next step was to find the apps for this .
we still know one where all the tankers are .
so you &apos;re just going to go to the &apos; nuclear projector .
what &apos;s the other metamori phobias do you go through ?
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other marks .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
this constant feedback is not true in real life .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
a research mester on the issue of user interface design .
i &apos;m also going to resolve what &apos;s in there .
you don &apos;t know anything possible in this goldfish glass . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great dwarfs .
in the future , most crime are going to play online .
we had no words for what we started there .
now he &apos;s on the red list of dangerous species .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
but i really believe that after us , something is coming .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of this communities .
the cellular communities began to abstract information again .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital mapping .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacine .
&quot; don &apos;t go &quot; -- it turns out to be untrue .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the brick .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s being put together again .
also , urban designers and construction are very interested .
there &apos;s not even online yet . there &apos;s no stretch .
this doesn &apos;t work at all for memory itself .
our steps in the digitization of life were exponentially exponentially .
this is a star night , probably never seen this before .
in the course of this discovery journey , i learned a lot .
as a child , i was constantly recording comic books and so on .
when we start to think about it , it changes everything .
that &apos;s right now the ultimate goal of our goal .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
we were all over the place as well as we were .
a lot of people talk about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
i was pretty much obsessed with the deep sea .
so if sound says , there &apos;s no soul .
this is the most difficult part in my talk .
i can &apos;t play this way today in 20 years .
both cases of accidents came to me , ask me to go .
so much testosterone , but no response to it .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my hand .
1m is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the end ?
that &apos;s why the way you think about how you think .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
now , how do people die in such a hack ?
the first story is by charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
i sold carnivores all over the country , around the world .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can turn it around .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that , but didn &apos;t .
no , the throwing is exactly the right thing , right ?
many of you are covered by faces and so on .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
in both cases , it was operated , and it was fine to them .
she didn &apos;t have a treaty of brain damage .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
and the fish also had the fortune to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the numbers of language .
it was the default line to drugs .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
there &apos;s more behind that , it &apos;s still deeper .
but we just know a little bit about where things go .
ok , think about how extreme self-motivates .
i know what people think when you see that .
let &apos;s ask you , ask evidence , ask you .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
this is how it happened earlier on the village .
this is what &apos;s going on with the genetic machine .
there is a political argument in our country .
they decided to get them to the beaters machine .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental copying .
it could happen within a time-time learning framework .
... it &apos;s the crowdsourcing .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with them .
i worked in a coal mining mining -- dangerous .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there &apos;s a sunshd , and he said , &quot; right ?
that means that you go back to the board .
so , like a human being with a certain set of things .
and of course , how do design impact on perception .
it &apos;s a disaster for the bottom two billion , but it &apos;s a disaster .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
lawyer : i &apos;m a lawyer .
we have an abstract hip language .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
but actually , it was a big fun night in that night .
we had to worry about the lawyers that we were worried about .
it was called &quot; automatically compelling stone . &quot;
it &apos;s a certificate .
now , because you don &apos;t know that it was different .
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to do ?
he took a famous photo . how was it ?
it slows down to one of our big problems .
we &apos;re looking at the process that &apos;s self-fueled .
thylacines ? yes . alive ? yours .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
but you can combine something special about it like this .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
because the images eat it for you to recommend .
listen , and wine , you &apos;re in this museum .
the idea is to overcome a digital security system .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain it .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
in fact , the progressive society is based on energy progress .
this was not a film , not a hd , that was real .
i wasn &apos;t there a long time ago with miguel .
because you know , this is a fun process .
have you ever seen a client tree ?
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i described .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
it &apos;s new america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
frog , the carbon will be clean every day .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
so i go back to a step , and i get another view of it .
i filmed in war areas -- difficult and dangerous .
so we should be better at figuring out what the goal is .
we can do the same stuff in fact with less energy .
if we make cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
in other words , game is our adaptation .
can you imagine something good that comes out of tabak ?
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
you can just call a few names , and people will understand .
diphin , tubes , kindergarten ...
this is a variable one of the things that was done .
well , the energy source is about the time .
and it was an experience that couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
it caused immense youth in the control room .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
he said , &quot; the skin seems like a sponge .
it &apos;s this beijing , promised taste .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
and this is how it flies its elderly .
and then there &apos;s a whole lot of simulations .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the course of the civic years .
the musical child is the extension of our body .
he just lived in nine-and-a-half years .
hey , puma , do you really get serious ?
a baby needs about a sixth of wind .
so i know some of you who haven &apos;t been wearing .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
in 25 years , it will be gone from here to here .
it &apos;s like asking someone to sneak the sun .
please follow me because the circle is going to end up again .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
this is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face it .
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds of .
he &apos;s a biologist at vetla de palma .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
i have a friend who drives a passeri .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound .
and because we &apos;re getting older , we &apos;re going to get the wind bigger .
this is the time period where you fall in love .
and also today we depend very , very strong stories .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and the predictions , as you read , are serious .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
and i didn &apos;t expect that to change that .
it &apos;s also my big , life-long love and fascination .
and what i got good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
why are they giving us when we can &apos;t buy it ?
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
a few years ago , i started developing litta living thing .
the brotherbreaks always describe them as untouched .
my grandfather was during the prohibition in prison .
she was a weapon , strong woman , she had effect .
so , in a sense , the technique gives us the technique .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
but what if you want to see the paintings ?
but my logical side didn &apos;t like it either .
i just want to say a little bit about salatrocities .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . happy wish .
we &apos;ve also brought litta to design schools .
this is the simulation of the esapeake bay bay .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against injustice .
my uncle died at alcohol diseases .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
in fact , we &apos;re also a multiverse community community .
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
let &apos;s call the animal beginners , it costs a lot of money .
if a neighbor helps the other , we strengthen our communities .
ohhhhh , wowwwwwwwww !
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing regalvanity .
50 percent of their decisions have been made within nine minutes or less .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny chip .
and my talk today is mostly about these cognitive action .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called collecting collections .
open the map , and jump with a click .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a lot of transparency right now .
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
you could also use ordinary design -- technology to spread .
one of my friends did it -- richard boller has been doing it .
imagine if you could really start flying these dots .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
these are the kinds of questions that we need to encounter .
i was fascinated by the election and beauty of biology .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
we need to start changing the real world into a game .
and this is from an economist . so he &apos;s logically .
i mean , how much do we take from our memories ?
the more money you deserve to satisfy your happiness .
that our survival of survival is linked to each individual .
ten minutes later , the judge took a break .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
and yes , i have a job , as you might recognize .
secondly , photos would have the same illumination .
my mother , my sister , and i slept in the same bed .
for example , this one that is completely logical .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to get out of it .
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of statement .
and the movie is going to be called &quot; the conviction &quot; .
i &apos;m ji , and this is my suitcase .
just that i think it &apos;s more like him , not true .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy it . thank you very much .
but it turns out that this is not all .
i mean , let &apos;s say , why do we fight that ?
that &apos;s a lot of deaths through masks , 20 per hour .
so there should be a nine on the beginning of my death row .
because they &apos;re the people who are experts for taste .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
i mentioned that to miguel , and he was kidding .
so the brush of the bones , the better the system . &quot;
and then i &apos;m going to think of it immediately , which is unfair .
and also , what you would think of today in the mind .
and the oil , we &apos;re going to replace it by other energy systems .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not doing it .
like algae -- and other fearful things .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
it was totally excluded that she could fail .
so that really threw me right , and i wanted to get more .
and immediately , i see another pattern that &apos;s inside .
yeah , it looks like this down there is the burden there .
that &apos;s why not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
we &apos;ve been using ourselves in holland now over three years .
and if you can , i &apos;ll find some of the weird things .
i know now that it was the reason of the sea .
and that was the first time i learned this .
i studied wife , and she was in breathtaking .
and the whole time i collected more and more knowledge .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a bat gets 300 .
in 2010 , we had just connected under two billion people online .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
and the lighting goes through the rest of the book .
&quot; because she &apos;s been holding it this morning , &quot; he said .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropy .
this approach is true of all new things that we do .
since that time , we &apos;ve all received the species of recognition .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
now , your life self is not going to be happier .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
here &apos;s a picture of a oranguitar in kentucky .
he &apos;s got a fueling municipal for 15 .
i can say , the canary is a man .
we &apos;ve moved forward to the so-called bird age .
this is 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
this is the audience that we just recently finished .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
but if you can , if you &apos;re in a foreign way .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t seem much longer to be human .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about right now .
or want to be more fitter , more powerful , more power .
and i don &apos;t just mean any less successful , even though that &apos;s part of it .
my great-grandparents all died when they were 60 .
now , where are we going to go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
that &apos;s kind of like , you know , in the front of the delhi .
and of course , you can never give it to germany . &quot;
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be efficient .
and the more open i talked about , the more i should tell you .
and i celebrate , i wine like a little kid .
obviously it &apos;s not going to fit all of my tiny suitcase .
if you &apos;re happy , you add other happy people .
players are masters of spiders in spiders .
how can we transmit these feelings from the play into reality ?
this is how it became the same , bad team of one under the best .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us care .
that &apos;s how people really thought about creativity in the west .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
one of the things that was that the phone was never broken .
the depending on its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
a few months earlier , and i had forgotten everything .
even who kills someone , isn &apos;t just a murderer .
the invention of language , for example , was a smaller step in this direction .
and the next interesting phase took about a billion years .
and this video was actually sent to january in january .
each of these themes , of course , made of many , smaller decisions .
there &apos;s a lot of other people , but i &apos;m missing the time .
today , i want to tell you about circles and openings .
they interact with their environment and their experiences .
this trick you can do your friends and neighbors . thank you .
you know , there was no mandarin in paradise .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be able to tell you .
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
we &apos;re seeing that phosphorus is really critical .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting about vision .
i apologize that i have to be so strong .
second , what economists call tuna tunisia .
and i think that &apos;s what the world looks like .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
so it has nothing changed , and yet everything has changed .
we just passed the 7-billion-billion-dollar march .
then , let &apos;s take this analogy into the future .
so , if you want to do the light again .
it was a store called the dragger .
are you so far ? you see a little nervous .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
the things that are used only are going to be used in technical systems .
so the device you see there , it doesn &apos;t work .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
they did that by providing the country to the land .
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
they &apos;re called the fear of willingness . they &apos;re called the risk of welcome .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
there &apos;s only the second best , the fire department .
you can throw them off , where they go and stand .
an amazing error rate . one of nine innocent guilty .
and i want to tell you two , maybe three examples of examples .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually going to get a rolling iceberg .
this is somebody who &apos;s safe at the rest of 10 .
we have used to say that things happen .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black boys as a mandatory .
they &apos;re in there , they want to go to the end of the gangs .
and then people could get the food and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
because that &apos;s where the actual government work is happening .
&quot; 2.5 to one thing ? what do you feed ? &quot;
and then we started negotiating with insulation .
the conventional system all over the world looks like this .
i play games , which could have these sound to mean .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re helping with , they &apos;re asking for people .
but also , our perception of self , as they deceive us .
and other examples are the ambitious systems , intelligent systems .
how many doors have the house where they live ?
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s also good .
and i believe it , and i feel like we should teach that .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
some people were disappointed that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
i sent them home without talking to my doctor .
the cost of solar energy in the last year was 50 percent .
we need to let ourselves go to the machine of the government .
there &apos;s a direct back office of this for the direct refugee .
the evidence of software takes a few years into a few years .
and sure enough , we can find fast food chain .
cats look at cats looking at this video .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
and what happened was that i needed a experts .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned language .
i just wish i could see my children growing up .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
it has moments of life , one after the other .
and i translated them to fund an expedition .
we &apos;re talking about the flesh of information overseas .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering collection .
that &apos;s what &apos;s happening in the first year , half of his advertising .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
so they &apos;re moving around and making art installations like this .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
i was shocked , and i was crushed to the inside .
i went from the emergency department to my way home .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
i say that because i think identity is very important .
because all these new technologies today are feeding themselves from themselves .
because your life depended on whether they did the job right .
and these people know something that we lost from the eyes .
i knew that she was here to leave .
today we &apos;re not just going to find out about something we do with it .
a typical walmart offers you 100,000 dollars today .
do you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you is what &apos;s truly amazing .
for example , the previous example , it was about finding the detail .
he said he didn &apos;t say that . he &apos;s going to ask you .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought in .
if it wasn &apos;t moving anymore , you dig it up .
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
again , what potential we want to call off ?
i &apos;d like to say we &apos;re ready for our own episode .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
if we looked at how feelings are related to income .
and this is a little hard to justify , i think .
there was no christmas trees . we did it all .
and that &apos;s not what we should do . our healthcare system is mimic .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
the program that i use here is a little experiment .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
the depending on a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not so sure .
it &apos;s impossible to say , how the photo was actually put together .
the words , as long as his friends did , spotally .
and we found that there was actually a context .
you know , how many decisions do you make a typical day ?
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
so the driving force behind is cyber -- superpower .
i didn &apos;t have two years with my wife .
the pilot gave the machine to the hudson river .
the openness is , the death of life is a part of life .
this keeps us at the distance , and it keeps us still evolving .
but there was always a life cycle of life in their presentations .
it &apos;s about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
you see the person who &apos;s wondering what &apos;s going on inside .
most of my activities , i have two huts on it .
it turns out that dna synthetization is very difficult .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we think about our future as a predictive memory .
now , the memory itself is a storyteller .
what it was ruined was the memories of the experience .
we &apos;re going to go to the next few days .
there &apos;s a incremental health nerd there .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
it &apos;s a fish , but it &apos;s also a bird reservation .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love story .
this first one , which was more like a passionate monkey .
he &apos;s very happy about this because he &apos;s disappointed them .
because the music is a language , and a language is there to communicate .
and first of all , i think , is the first time to ask you , what is the right thing .
but so far , i &apos;m going to do it a little more curious .
i started thinking , i should just start the project .
we can , of course , look at the waste problem .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
if you can &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
just to precise time-lapse votes them .
when the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
so you can ask , how happy is life itself ?
most of you are completely ignored by memory itself .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have any consequences .
has a single one in the audience ever seen someone in masks ?
it turns out that the question is whether you can get that on zero .
you can like to test it after my talk in your immune system .
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum of all , quite a lot of ideas .
and she asked him what are your hobbic ?
so that , in every store , you can get things back .
so the question is , how do we deal with these windmills ?
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
so , for example , shit out the environment , less than car .
and life lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
so if i &apos;m going to take you to the side , that &apos;s what you &apos;re interested in .
i see myself as if i could just write a song ?
she said it would be like a thunder of air .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
and you say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
they put a blue one on a green one , and they can make light .
but they don &apos;t take the prevention of prevention .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is going very quickly .
yet we &apos;re still coming to the galapagos islands .
more and more people came in , just because they were angry .
it was the fear of terror that made her life shaped .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
we have a lot of cells that are no longer on themselves .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
and what &apos;s below that is what we call offices .
but where would the next aed to help this patient ?
you have to make 62 different decisions to design your car completely .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go like that .
almost as if we were prepared for our lives .
but in my humanity , i also given my ego space .
i was the only one who could talk to the trajectory .
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
think of this as a point , as a flying point .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
this is a fascinating adventure that you go to .
this will affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
we found this in terms of happiness itself .
they &apos;re leaving their dark . they &apos;re almost never going to do it .
usually most people start to orient themselves about the task .
you &apos;ve got to introduce the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
if you walk , yes , everybody destroys footprint on the ground .
if we take it over , we can shake a little bit back .
the most powerful mountain worker is the head of massey .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
there &apos;s a magic amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a book .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will only be worse .
and the online of online criminals are very easy to understand .
because by marine protected areas , we &apos;re basically restoring the past .
i want to conclude with a story that really got me excited .
sometimes i lose the equilibrium . a story to conclude .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
so now we &apos;ve missed the timeline again .
so today , evolution can happen at the time of microseconds .
here he lifts a rare glimpse .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
we could , of course , reduce 10 percent , but what does that do ?
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i probably won &apos;t all of you on this journey .
he said , &quot; in germany , there are no death punishment .
autocolor , outside of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
they &apos;re not even coming out of the museums .
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
i really like your way , sergey . now .
i became the miracle part of not dying on this day .
it &apos;s called eyeyebrow , and you can see the description .
this is the average size of a greenland icon .
i mean , what does anyone do with so many output ?
and as a general term , we can use the word &quot; sexual sexuality . &quot;
so the question is , can we do this ? i think .
we all have to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , he &apos;s called miguel .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to do in today &apos;s pile .
then the same thing happens in a good , excellent conversation .
i have to tell you , i think , this was a big mistake .
we take images of this mini-big bang into detectors .
economists call this a parallel improvement .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what gives us modern progress .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
this is a whole book , an example of nonverbal data .
and of course , we all share the same adaptation .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the foul of ingenuity .
there are cases of accidents that are like the ingenuity .
let me end with three of my own words : i remember .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just coming out of our heads .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
ceos are something about average . but here it &apos;s going to be interesting .
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
this is a evidence that by the way , that men are not pigs .
this depuppet ran over to the older black .
but i don &apos;t know how receives people will be .
you go around the block and you take it as a revelation .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the speed room .
bonobos are related to chimpanzees with our next living relatives .
the first of these is a contradiction , to admit complexity .
they invest a lot of their time in terms of growing the growing structures .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little it &apos;s going to be supported .
usually you &apos;re just dancing , and some are coming , you don &apos;t .
now he mentioned the mineral needs of physical lankton .
i take the breathing of the audience , consciously or unconscious .
you know , that &apos;s the actual truth behind the absence .
but the question i want to throw up is : why not ?
and the best part of this is perhaps what we expect in health .
this is a technology innovation innovation that there is today .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
wr wants to help people who were convicted .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
how did he get to look for this particular way ?
let &apos;s jump back to moma , again in new york .
tempt is going to be part of the show , which is pretty driving .
we produce androgen , and we talk about androgenes .
and if you can do it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this is scandals , and we should be ashamed .
and this is the value of this experience , this very simple practice .
but as they talked to different people around the world , they have talked about these opportunities .
they now have a renewable energy of five percent 10 percent .
and they &apos;ve done this with the so-called lead-land maps .
but the key is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so i was busy with that when , of course , what is intuitive or intuitive .
and these are just the biohacker , the individual people .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to the scientific world .
this struck me when i wanted to delete my jeans .
he invited the king of sidewalk to the dinner table .
but somehow we can do it by this problem .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last year .
but instead of diving into panium , he just stopped .
how about tears that we can &apos;t even predict ?
if you look at people who have them to do it .
and guess what we found in the attacker code ?
imagine that every single one of the people is tasted .
okay , let me give you a little blood for you .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
new investments to create good jobs .
6 : social fall . public speaker : 65 toes .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with me like this and play .
that means that the player will be safe from 10 to 10 .
a long time ago , there were gray whales there -- 500 years ago .
in many , you &apos;re going to say , these are crazy ! that &apos;s good .
the x interpretation of a piece of a piece of a piece is this comparable .
from my eye angle , i saw the janitors go up and down .
fireflies in a glass of glass , i always found a very exciting one .
so this picture , for example , has about 10 billion points , i think .
so i decided that , when i was 15 , i was diving .
here &apos;s what i &apos;m doing . we &apos;re looking at exactly the center here .
and within less years , lego went into every household .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer .
and i want to show you my output for this week .
56 percent of all nonviolent cases don &apos;t happen before court .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally sterile .
i asked him how he became such a fish experts .
there was the nuclear facilitators in there .
from that time , there &apos;s an anecdote that you might know .
no longer necessary to whistle or sing .
and six milliseconds , even a very exciting phenomenon of the phenomenon .
it goes back a lot , in the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
so , i think it &apos;s a very unyellow hack .
i think somehow , you know , six dollars or something like that .
this actually has only two thousand really in the form of these networks .
finally , one solution , which is big enough to solve our problems .
so this looks like a basketball placement .
and , if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
i didn &apos;t have to do it better . i didn &apos;t leave myself .
well , in fact , the number of violent crime didn &apos;t change very much .
i first ate it in a restaurant in southern spain .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity .
it was always so inspiring , so whispering .
the death penalty in america is defined by iranium .
turn the trunks on the side , went home .
so alone , this airport has a surface of 100 square kilometers .
i like things that are weird . i like special things .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
so maybe you should be in front of the interview a little bit of this . &quot;
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine guide .
this is a clip from this attack of angular code .
we &apos;ve got his bed , so he can see it outside .
we degraded a person who has worth a value for our society .
we &apos;re going to make games to get out of the real world .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
what about kindergarten ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : it &apos;s .
the secret is that the game of the key to this skills is the key .
this is indeed the true of human and machine .
a few . probably about how many creative people there are here .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
they produced the highest constructions in the least time .
it &apos;s about five tons of tons of tons on the planet .
i grew up with a cave of science fiction .
he said , &quot; we &apos;ll build siv , not intense .
so here was finally a company trying to do it right .
the component is always becoming more and more of the friend that you live with .
and i &apos;m not so sure you &apos;re really staying .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little trip .
there was , in my opinion , a very good code .
in fact , nasa showed that there are lots of them out there .
they like to increase the paralysis and the satisfaction .
now , i wondered , how can i get this really overwhelming ?
it &apos;s an independent area . they &apos;re all controlling minerals .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view .
somebody was broken , and the system was fooled .
photos like this : a building along a lot of bicycle street .
the biggest fear they had pickled before , rape and death .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to get all these extensions out .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange road road .
but of course , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
i brought seven of my pants down , and this is all .
but a lot of people get caught in a very strange position .
our gut is a wonderful friendly environment for these bacteria .
now , the two types of self throw two terms from happiness .
well , life itself lives his life itself .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness .
it &apos;s just a bble calories . it &apos;s mimic .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
ah , the majority . this is what i like to see as a doctor .
my inspiration comes from a event that &apos;s 2,500 years back .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
now , what does that have to do with the placebo effect ?
smallpox . the smallpox people killed billions of people on this planet .
it &apos;s the renewables , as they &apos;re often called .
this is a fish up in the southwestern corner .
i &apos;m asking , how professionally competent was this diagnosis ?
the notides have the function of letters in a writing .
and then the alignment of the pre-industrial cultures .
that means you navigated about sound and rhythm .
so that &apos;s just one application of many that you can do with it .
and then we &apos;ve done this kind of coct of a cochct .
at the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
should i respond to that email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
this is what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
54 percent of the death rate of death penalty .
essentially , the concrete stone for the building block of our time .
how about a new sentence , never been hearing voices before .
how can a judge turn to something he &apos;s not ?
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lynh mobs .
so programs that can make up the most numerous animals .
for example , the fish had been recorded on a glue .
opportunities that have been allowed to be allowed , were encouraged .
so i was doing it a few years ago , just to do that .
finally , we should welcome the fear of willingness .
an eighty , played marke . how is your brand ?
why is it important to start ? what &apos;s the red ?
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free .
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
well , in that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
and the key indication for this is the extinction of the languages .
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s not this test .
and that &apos;s called androgen-reception-defect .
we &apos;re developing collaborative , heart creature .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a ph.d .
right now , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
and soon , i wrote an article about intelligent food .
so i want to go to this machine , and i want to go to the future .
so i offered a $ 10,000 prize for the winners .
one day this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
there was no piano whatsoever at the time as an instrument .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
even if you were to shoot yourself , you would have emissions .
most people know the most people know this from the software area .
this is actually live in the internet . you can check it out .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nunveigh .
but nothing was invented that would let me go back to that , until now .
and the best part of this is that they connect to magnets together .
some of my smarter passions were passions in the last five years .
i looked in the rocks , and it was a little bit pink .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular ton .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
so the dramatic numbers come to the prisons .
i gave some talks in germany about death penalty death .
a child in india says , &quot; today , i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know a lot about government when i started this program .
this is my lane wage . a very simple thing .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
what context is that to the thought and feelings about you ?
and if the threats are dangerous , then really bad things can happen .
and that urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
you &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
if we don &apos;t actually take a phosphorus and abandon it .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most magician thing for me .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours of video are highly embedded .
if you could do it for the people , you could also help me .
and it just disappears all these companies , one after the other .
i &apos;m sad that we never learned as adults .
remember , it &apos;s free , nobody deserves us from it .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
and that &apos;s why , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of individual alism .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individual .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go to the house .
if you just have one of them , it would be a very different world .
specialized skills and processing skills and their combination of success .
people here have contributed to the development of this miracle .
and somehow we need to create changes that are on zero .
we still find other strings about what their rights are .
this is the time that most perceptual perceptions we have .
this is our youngest taster down there .
by the end of march , the lhc will be functional again .
and this is the message that i took in the medical school .
you know , how do you call a 3,000-foot in league baseball ?
i think that in many places , the opposite of poverty is poverty .
if someone likes , it &apos;s not just a liar .
and that &apos;s why i think the ted community should be the ted horse .
and it has spread , of course , of course , of course .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say , thank you ted .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
well , finally , the film has a very big deal of land .
this is actually just a period of two and a half weeks .
these people will be connected to the film in eternal -- always for them .
so all these green areas , these are the brightest environments .
one is called jazz , and the other one is called &quot; swine . &quot;
so unfortunately , we have a piece of god to be able to virtual .
i got to the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelming .
in the short time here , i realized one : ted has a identity .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good piece of intuition to actually extend the experiments .
in my opinion , mass has changed our world fundamentally .
this is all reality today , and the future is going to be much more possible .
so that allows play to play together by binary , trust and trust .
this is what it says , the more you surround it , the better .
people said , don &apos;t you have fear to have success ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding me , but i can live with it .
and what i learned is that error is absolutely inertia .
i love this one : &quot; watson includes human enemies . &quot;
i looked at her , and i smiled , but she looked very serious .
three months later , i was moved , and the adventure went on .
it &apos;s about making poles out of the needle river .

it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold , and elsewhere itself can afford to afford it .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress in the same way .
the idea of this is obviously not just the machine operators in the control room .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- it really made me out of the socks .

in this archaic model that we have a natural relationship to the virtually natural relationship .
as a child , i had collections of lungs , a stack , a booth and mumbling .
and so from the interest of this , in this technology , i &apos;ve just moved on there .

unfortunately , not the bach , but maybe you can help the mammals a little bit .
in high school , a student told me that brian goldman would learn a bloodline .
i &apos;m going to focus on one of the statistics that i hope most of you have heard .
so if we look at the news , we prefer to look for negative news .

this is what &apos;s called the old-up law , or just an ongoing psychology that affects us , again , in perception .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re sitting next to the actual force .

we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
i can accelerate all the sequence by turning the speed into one or another direction .

this also presents the entertainment of this talk , so i hope it has fallen to you .
but in fact , my research at the institute of the future is just the opposite thing .
nothing goes into my sleeve or comes out , no trickles , and you can study everything .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics , which made me not an fanatic at all .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often known as the wave reactor .
i remembered it last year when i brought mosquitos , and somehow people liked it .
it matters for the age that most of the time in the first semester , the great laws of history .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from this melting water .
that &apos;s great . the tube didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
the viral particles were then released by the cells and came back and forth . coli .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we have adapted this long dot to the choice of our common choice .

and so , by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since its time , as i have to say , i have to say , very successful leadership .
you don &apos;t sit around and flip around . there &apos;s always something important to do .
our memory tells us stories , which means that we can keep our experience a story .
tell you that there are negative implications that have to do with the clouds that change things ?
that &apos;s kind of the deadline that gave us the environmental models that we need to keep .
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some parts .
you told me that they don &apos;t do it . in fact , they &apos;re not going to leave the glass .
that &apos;s why a lot of people come and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
they heard about this book of charles darwin , the origin of species , and the trigger of humans .
i promised my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , oma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
evolution is all about the genome of the genome on the next generation , adaptive and survival for generation .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my physical therapy .
now , if i had opened the lens with the 600 images in it , i would have spent another hour .
people are looking in their beliefs , and that &apos;s how you can &apos;t free them .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design workshop .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor , which seems a bit difficult , but maybe they &apos;ll tell us about it .
this is what we &apos;re seeing here again , again , this one again , again , all the individual , aggregate .
overview : now i &apos;m sort of interacting with the object , can zoom in , zoom in .
now , first of all , it sounds very banal , but it &apos;s excellent when you get closer to it .
because often people get people , you can &apos;t make it useless , so everyone can deal with it .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of scar and boggles .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace it , it will replace a huge challenge .
if you break up the goldfish glass so that everything is possible , it sends the satisfaction .
if i put into a room -- just like now , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking about .

that means we have a common ancestry , a evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember her . &quot;

we &apos;ve done it on about a hundred genes from the 500 or so that are here .
and this really reaches these ideas , these constraints for the available place on the screen .
and it &apos;s humiliating to think that our species may have existed since 600,000 years .

it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks have been produced -- 75 rocks for every person on this planet .
and to win , the device has to be a better diagnosis than a team of high-qualified doctors .
the founding fathers were from my point of view , the original atomic activists , and that &apos;s why .
they were playing a strangely game , and they were able to break out of an episode .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are success method .
it would have been without the surveillance , but it makes it much more important .
sure enough , i would never achieve an alien world with a spaceship , which probably seemed very unlikely to get me .
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer it immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
all right , just to close , i want to realize that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
who knows when the movie comes out , we may see a hormone volcano coming out of it .
what are we going to do with the fact that we &apos;re just different from them by nuclei disgust ?
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and increase my strength and go out my strength .
but if you &apos;re in a epic adventure and you say , &quot; we &apos;re going to get the oil out of it . &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have never been able to use the potential for human potential .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon , kids will die again because that &apos;s just one question of numbers .
in the rich world , there are millions of us who have been threatened by just one generation , hardly .
here we see a very fundamental service . is there at home to light so that you can read the homework ?
the greeks called these gods of divine , the creativity of creativity .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see how she &apos;s taken to the next century .
and we &apos;re installing an evolutionary process in the machine , which is what &apos;s going on in the microsecond area .
so in other words , the future is around a year since i &apos;m on this world .
they &apos;re shooting the decision -- they &apos;re shooting on themselves , even if they &apos;re interested in their own best interest .

recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said that they were just losing this model .
a method that &apos;s particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve used a lot of times is evolution itself .
we had a team of field lows in boston last year , and we had a team of programming programs .
so , imagine you were at the same time in several places , how would that feel ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus , it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
so the nerve cells are the information processing , which these cellular communities have built .
so , it was possible to connect the little digital head to the rotor-tax in .
eaceacea , a little antioxium , which helps them jump on the sproughts .
no , the lie , which i &apos;m talking about , has to do with it , is to fake itself .
if professors become curious , they &apos;re often going to be shallow into this research semester .
this is the machine age of the machine , and this is the book , and this is what happens is the graphics gray .
and it &apos;s about getting into a playful , creative , original , original way of solving a problem .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first to be the fuel of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
it turns out that it was really significant , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do anything with your movie . &quot;
in the moment , it was like a film director had a bookstore .
that &apos;s as if i would say , shake your child , it &apos;s only three times more than five times .
and the main lesson that we think we &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
but there &apos;s no verbs that we can look at where you learn how to do fire .
to be able to write the piece , it will always be more and more to my personal , to play it .
but these concepts of cyber-like , which bring us back to those possibilities back again .
so those naughtened to survive longer , and they multiply into the scale .
so you can just get these words that we &apos;re also using in the language of political correction .
the first example is what many of you know , and some of them estimate , very few of them don &apos;t even need at all .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor says to them : we could make a or we could do b .
i want to share with you this mechanism today , or something that &apos;s unfamiliar with you .
so now , i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite images , harvest workers from the harbor rip .
but now , if you have evidence , if you have evidence of evidence , you have to take that evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
in openness , for example , the garbage is 20 percent of the waste of the waste in wind .
but over and over again , very rarely , something special happened , one of them was actually transmitted in space .
my heart attack , i was so frightened while i was trying to figure out what was standing in front of me .
the human part of this book , far from the end , of course , is what we &apos;re interested in most .
immediately , you &apos;re going to get one of them , for those of you who have predicted that , you can &apos;t prove it .
they &apos;ve reformed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever been done .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that will have changed a lot of biology from biology .
and because you &apos;re obsessed with the mind . how can you be hurt ?
for these non-engineers , little-little-fies became another material , electronics just became another material .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the human community bring us ?
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that indiscriminate is also very time-consuming .
and every time it &apos;s divided , the chemicals are distributed into the same amount of chemicals .

they were just told that the serena students , and they are the students with the note , and they also taught them something and they were treated .
the terrorism of the terrorism , but it was called elomile and wind and solar energy , and since i started the middle of the line .
depending on how i brushing , and when i throw up , it &apos;s a very different reporter than if there &apos;s a living kind of living .
and as you can see , this is a very insane area , and you had to sort of navigate , from island to protect food .
he was smuggled at the age of two years in jail to hide under her rockets , because she couldn &apos;t live him without life .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of your extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
just remember that a massacre war with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has better communication than president reagan did 25 years ago .
in a world where every minute two days , video is going to be high-tech , can only be really unique and unexpected , as the videos mentioned .
and a while ago , it was like , if you wanted to get a formula , you would take your budget , and you would put your money on a good driver and a good car .
today you can have a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome from about 20,000 dollars and the space of one week .
i came to the conclusion that i was working on a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not inevitably contradictable , just differently .
and you know what ? when i say that , people write me up and say , &quot; what do you do ? people want to do what you want ? &quot;
because , as i said at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it , and it &apos;s not a chance to really form .
and even though the answer to the question , &quot; no , it &apos;s certainly your experience of the football game of your child &apos;s child &apos;s mind .
they have a language , and a margin script called the linguistic exogamie , you have to marry somebody who speaks a different language .
in other words , unlike the ancient middle-class classes , their existence of being completely unknown , there was no more sophisticated thinking .
and gary said that he would be ready to provide all of the people in this audience an all-included urb to the most beautiful world .
so , the wedding really got my interest , and we started working with it almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
some people like to add up and graceful to the bitter , while others don &apos;t stop it and put it in a dramatic passion .
of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the common ground , we need to begin to ask in question , why do we keep certain separations separate ?
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in vaccine with vaccine against influenza that has been built in the cells of a plant .
we have a comic comic . we have &quot; level up &quot; high &quot; for regional , knowledge , knowledge , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
so , if we look at the development of our society , right here , we &apos;re going to move from the third one that we have in the fourth generation of social life , or form .
i know and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job , because you &apos;re coming out of a series of hundreds of thousands of pieces of programs that have done the job .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , you can just open up all the doors in your house , and you can see very laughter music , and see if the livestock are ? &quot;
in the other part , i was embedded in insurgency , the tragic narrow of violence , the drug abuse and the isolation .
when we warmed it up , and the lights looked at the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always there in a piece .
the founding fathers returned this idea back , and they came through a new anatomic concept , and this concept said that all people were created equally .
there &apos;s a scholarship called wolf , and you say , you know , wolf , singing , there &apos;s no freedom .
that means that the local village is actually a global village with the same principles , of course , of course , intuitive , but also the total transparency .
the reason that i felt bad was with all of these available opportunities , my expectations for what a good couple of jeans went up .
i sent some facebook news stories , some twitter news stories , and i gave people the opportunity to stand up on my tedtalk .
and maybe we can do it , widening away as something natural , selecting and useful , and feel that way through their presence , no longer belong to it .
i &apos;m saying that i &apos;m holding my wrist to make sure nothing disappears in my sleeve or disappear , and that &apos;s a lie .
because we &apos;ve been doing all this with only 10 to 12 people who &apos;ve been working for years , sometimes we were two to three months of the lake .
and now you can just , if you want to do anything , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , this courage to practice .
remember , as carl sagan , the voyazger-spaceship vehicle in 1990 , when it moved to saturn , back into the earth ?
and then my friends , who make little conversation movies , &quot; well , how should we compete with these big , gigantic filmmaking ? &quot;
what they came back was an anatomic concept , and they put it through another , which was radically radical , and 200 years for us .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you look in italy , like the people in the high bow , you know , it &apos;s like that coke from the car , you know .
a country has already offered his supreme court to provide court as a dish for the goods occupation of the village court .
and i was amazed to be resistant to resistance , to the point of what is the most effective public health care in the history of humanity .
i spend most of my time with the social weakest in the social settlements and places where there &apos;s a lot of hopeless hopelessness .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every commercial business that we talked to , has their client to let the fingers of it .
they were kidding the toy , and they decided that anatomically , the common countryside , not the differences , and that was very radical .
and at the end of that , we &apos;re really standing in a choice . do we want to live in a monomatic world of monoculum , or in a polymatic world of life ?
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that piece of metal that quantum mechanical , we had to get all the trajectory out .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s the environment , it &apos;s the highest , isn &apos;t there ? yes ?
we &apos;ve seen almost 20 years of digitizing the human genome , and as we &apos;ve sequenced the human genome , the change from the analog world of biology to the digital computer .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of pure , if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of your own being one of them .
so , to buy new jeans , i went to buy a lot of the year &apos;s trains , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
to give you a sense of the sensations , of course , i had to say something about this remarkable belief of the vocabulary and voodoo is not a culturally of the black magic .
and because there &apos;s nothing more important than our survival , the first ingredient for all of this information is part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i got most of the feedback , or where i had the greatest success , are those where i interacted with things .
now , i don &apos;t want you to use too much time to imagine because , if you think about all the time , you won &apos;t listen to me .
you have to separate two things : to be the medical fact , to be amputated , and to the other social opinion , whether i am disabled or not .
it was the basic idea of this company , which was , you know , the analog processes with visual pressure to jump over c. etc . and start to start with digital production .
and you don &apos;t have to -- you don &apos;t have to -- you don &apos;t have to take the data on a usb -- like we &apos;ve seen it at stuxels .
and in this way , in fact , the critical variable is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a memorable self from a living self , has very little impact on this story .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people are filling the system with life , and if that &apos;s the way that people do mistakes at the time .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure , send it to their doctor , and share it with others , for more than 100 dollars .
so the first case : all of the nuclear power of atoms that are made of the metal is still there , and at the same time , the same nuclear atoms are moving and off .
if i think about creating flow , then i don &apos;t have a lifetime of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of opportunity .
but the latest dna evidence that the etrushes , later , the tumbling realm , the same dna as the old lydics .
how to increase happiness is very different from how you think and whether you think of memory or think about whether you think of life itself .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think about a column -- you dig them -- you dig them without the complex .
we &apos;re going to turn it off , and we &apos;re expecting the first data in june or juli , and we &apos;re going to get our journey to try to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
we want the world of creation , the inventors , the inventors , the persuasive , because these world , in which we live , this interactive world , belongs to us .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the health staff .
so one day i decided to go to the filivestock , and i asked the head , &quot; does this model work that they really offer all these possibilities ? &quot;
the head of congress came up and said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but we might look at the tedtalk .
we need to have these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time machine and go into the future we &apos;re going to be happy to do that .
so again , i stood back with a little team on unknown terrain , and we turned around , &quot; avatar with a new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
and we don &apos;t have it , but this is actually staggering , i think , has been relatively well performed , people are quite convinced .
i mean , it can make sense of the fact that a thing at the same time is over two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they evolved .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all about what it takes to bring us from &quot; uh &quot; -- to a ta-da &quot; moment .
but the latent measured all the way back , and people in my company told me that we weren &apos;t able to do that .
i was seven bars at the time when i went back to one of his classes once again and played the last four balconies of chopin , a late work .
if your work was confined , you wouldn &apos;t look at everything for you , everybody knew you had this embodied genius , that you helped your test .
in nine people that we have executed , one that we have for innocent , who has been disappointed out of death and was released from the death cell .
so an organism could learn , for example , a particular one couldn &apos;t eat certain fruit , because she made it sick and made it sick , the last time he eaten them .
i personally find that it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to go into the ideas with your head .
it &apos;s about how to encounter people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and create a satisfying experience .
and finally , this elderly black man came with a very troubled face in the courtyard , and she just sat behind me , almost on the defense bank .
that &apos;s where this airplane is made of hundreds of thousands of pieces , which work together to make your trip safer . does it not make you visible ? &quot;
one day -- this is a real report -- this came in : &quot; thylacine in my trash . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults , met with me , relaxed into a box and was put in my hands .
we &apos;re going to have a process that might be challenged in the rule of 100,000 years , and we can compress it for a thousand years -- and maybe even at the next 100 years .
there &apos;s a number of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-oh moments than others , and under the worst , they &apos;re fraud bars .
that means we &apos;re proposing our first look before we see it , again , bringing it back to our device back in our hemisphere to say , okay .
his job is to create the conditions which are less than a billionth of the universe at the beginning of the universe -- and this is to 600 million times a second .
but they also keep a secret for our future , a future where we have to adapt to increasingly , through bigger creativity and printing .
and a lot of discussions that i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had in the last three years to the photovoltaics .
a saesday pender , if you make the full of water with water , the pressure has enough pressure , so i think that &apos;s the way four to searching around .
and it happened something interesting . what really happened to me about jacques cousteau , was the idea of a completely unknown world here on our own earth .
and our european interconnected network is basically only made of louder animals from big forces , where the wave is all over europe .
a process that , as everybody knows , who has ever tried to do something -- in other words , in other words , everybody here -- is not always reasonable .
and every year we ask the students to create business , products and services that can live within a decade from millennia to people .
i came to the ted because i believe that many of you have understood that the moral compulsion of the universe is far out there , but that it gets the injustice .
and finally , saturday : to develop a unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world without saying a word .
they didn &apos;t count , because he was stayed with a reminder ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had to keep .
i think that the molecular biology in general , so generally , i &apos;m talking about biotechnology , everything you &apos;re counting , synthetic biology and so on .
how would it be that the oppressed , wherever you are , to give a voice to pay attention to the attention and create change , for the first time ?
i love to find every opportunity to find a different colorful , crazy outfit , crazy outfit , and photographed time to photograph and photograph .
i told my wife , always if a human being in a moral framework because we should try to replace it by replacement .
and it turns out that if you make it that something concrete , it feels a very good tool to save people more .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for people who we love to keep fatty skins , but they also prefer to get good at it .
so we take something very complicated , turn it into sound , a sequence of daughters , and produce something very complicated in the head of others .
no , it just looks a lot better if we show that we &apos;re always involved in dancing the risks that create other people when they &apos;re putting fire .
now , in egypt , in egypt , the insurgency in april in 2011 , the main source of the egyptian police , and they found a lot of action .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of programming work , zeros and persistent , tony signed up to the first seven years after seven years .
so this is what this reactors was a problem , which is what we put in our fill , and it &apos;s going to reduce the waste of this process .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we &apos;ve been digitizing the biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing new biology and building new life .
but this is what keeps me at night -- one of the things that woke me up at night , and we &apos;ve never really needed as much progress as we have now .
according to burrerrwas the premier in january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million people on this film .
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate in the moment , building the coal force , because we don &apos;t otherwise , or gains , because that &apos;s not what &apos;s going to happen .
a lot of our friends thought that we were pretty stupid to do that , and that we were back to the checks and all the pictures on the walls would be the graffiti .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst errors only passive in the first five years , which is what many of my colleagues say , but total profit .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers of government who are taxes and receive benefits .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very , very exclusive lifespan ; at least he was really exclusive .
in a country that has just a heartbreaking crisis behind the congress , this congress changed with 124 to a voice .
it seems like we were fairly remote from the other parts of life , but actually the biggest part of life , the basic mechanisms are pretty much our cells .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this , as if the first sentence was the first set of nuns , of course , had to take the opposite without any evidence .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , which i &apos;ve worked so long before , how to reexperience it .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk , and he said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing , you know , listen to them . &quot;
now , there are margins and eighth marks , these things that come and go , but a contract , it &apos;s a pretty strong thing .
and if you &apos;ve ever got a mitt that the drugs of stuppy is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the data is a science for you .
if i tell you that somebody &apos;s life as an eight scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self .
now , i live with a few people in the company , and no one could give me an inflatable answer , until finally i finally thought about the senior biologists .
basically , you get each round of those sideways to happen , and while you &apos;re trying to form words , you &apos;re going to be examined about a dictionary .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot of wealthy , or maybe a little less likely to talk to you about it .
but then another , very interesting step , where things were totally different , because these cells began to communicate and exchange information so that communities came from cells .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference , we say , in climate .
they started out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see is tiles , and these density , poles .
we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous confidence in our future is the fact that we now have more than individuals to face the big challenges of our planet .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spread by selfish , it &apos;s kind of like the bug on the institution of the government .
what that means is that if you hit somebody , and you would tell them , oh , his father is a second meme , how much would you know about his size ?
and at this point , if you laugh , you realize how important this gap is , and how much time you need to make something that artists can tell us very well .
as it would feel like to live in a world where the german state allowed people to do , especially in particular , when there were a lot of jewelry .
and because the government is ultimately exhausting their power from us -- he &apos;s reminding you , &quot; are we people ? &quot; -- as we think about it , is going to affect how this change is happening .
are they reliable , stable , family , safe , safe , orbital , sacred , sacred , and how the dalai lama or yoda ?
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychotic comprehension from the repertoire .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with gay people whose gender is gender -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female types .
we had to do that at the time . if we read kids as a book , we took the description of the gas and tried it on the canvas in our heads .
we came up with the theme of music , and a few days later , i got a email , in the fact that nathaniel was interested in isolation for me .
and since we &apos;re giving ourselves the mediterror campus , for example , the virtual reality in our v.r.r.r. lab , we can actually do it all the time .
and i said , &quot; well , listen , you know , and i know both , if this book isn &apos;t bribery , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because it &apos;s as much sense as anything else i &apos;ve heard about when it was about explaining the absolutely crazy ending of the creative process .
so it &apos;s so far . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that has ever been counted -- 27 miles in the diameter .
and i argued that we might be able to create a new form of cambrian explosion in which there could be massive new education based on this digital design .
the reason that it was better than anything was worse than anything bad , when everything was worse , it was possible for people to make a pleasant experience .
and i had a handle with me that if i doubled my efforts to perfection and never doubled a mistake that the voice could surround .
so this is just a couple of clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i had several months to plan them to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
but also , because it turns out that we &apos;re using this whole time to actually change what we &apos;re capable of as humans .
i can tell you the sounds that the bach has had , on the modern wing , which can &apos;t make a baroo balcony .
already out of the german to translate into english , more knowledge can be formulated , once you put it around you , or you &apos;re about poetry .
bg : well , we need one of those scalable things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years .
if you also play , you &apos;ll see some nuances here , which are zoomed up , and the mouth are a sign of optimism , and the eyebrows show .
you have to imagine that if you do something of the classical hardware , five hours and with this new kind of natural software , you just have an hour of software .
i &apos;m a wall animal . i &apos;ve got to work with every day , i &apos;ve got to stand up and swim at the same time and swim , and i &apos;m really unpleasant .
so they figured out , loud herus , the worms and agrees a national strategy , and on a day you would eat the next day , you would play .
the other note is whether we use the zero-carbon emissions , whether it &apos;s used in all countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
the movie studio i sold this as &quot; romeo and julia ship on a ship , &quot; it became a film of episode , a passionate film .
so far in discussions , this insulin , which is going to take place , which is going to be a little net that has a little net , that has nothing to do with our altitude and nothing .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , where we can sort of bring the electric proportion of the island to one of the three .
that means that the interpret needs to translate that unprecedented language into a different language , namely concrete , non-verbal language .
the intuitive user has not been used since an apple &apos;s farming factor , fundamental success if i want to make technological devices that people want to do .
a lot of journalists called me the question , &quot; what are you going to do , what are you going to do , whether caster seya or male ? &quot;
now , what i hear is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want a huge fields of what &apos;s wrong .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them to get them together to play any kind of game to control their health better .
and imagine , i &apos;ve even been a five-year-old child with dr. p.m. , trying to stop these practices , natural success without success .
bg : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. 10 billion dollars a year spend more than you do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that lets us explore and interact , and the unexpectedly linked that we are , the real nutrients of creativity .
and since there was no video games nor this overwhelming with computer movies nor the whole language in media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
so , as you know in the village , who has what happened with wine , and when it happens , this is what &apos;s happening today , through this extension of our own mobile devices on global scale .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility that i was so handful and so i would be able to make my patient without contaminating him .
i got a punch box because i &apos;m not on the bike , but often there &apos;s a disability that doesn &apos;t let you go on the bike .
and so i see myself as one of the people in common with the most different experimental quantum physicists who need a good logic to put the complex ideas together .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream called &quot; a solution .
jacques cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating senior sensing , and places and a world of wonder that we could never have imagined before .
and if we can do it , of course , for that , for nike , for cloning and mauritz and all the textile texts .
in every step , we produced these pieces in the circuit so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process of what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
unlike the one in the 20th century , the sharing of the 20th century is our way to be part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or making something new .
my wife , my kids and i moved to the garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspirations and archives have taken our house to our house .
we can go out and go out and rearrange the data , and then we can see that circles are occurring , and cancer are suspected , but not for everyone .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the lungs , the heck , the salmon , the heavy fish , they &apos;re broken .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has doubled more than doubled , which has tripled an average income of the world &apos;s population .
one of the areas we see in which we look at this , in our culture , today , in the united states , is the fighting over the beginning and the end of life .
well , this is good , apart from being able to say that paul is running around vaccines and saying how valuable they are , and that people should just stop doing that .
the second one is a distinction of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s in between his life and being happy about his life or happy with his life .
you go up into this capsule , you sweep into this dark , hostile environment , where there is no hope for rescue rescue , if you don &apos;t make it back .
so you can also notice that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only from this deforestation , which is a hundred percent renewable .
it was prioriented in the cell , and the other chromosome was recognized as a material of the material , and so we had just one cell with a new chromosome .
and these scientists have just documented the different topics with these ceo habits , and how much time they make decisions that relate to the topics .
all of you think that i was between &quot; titanic , &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i &apos;d have been able to celebrate the harbor somewhere on a tuch on the beach .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and i should do it , because that story , as romantic as well as romantic as well .
my first memories are by this boat -- the steady tummy of the motor , the clapping of a thumb on the bug , and the far horizontal horizon .
and if you manipulate the speed of this novel , then you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor into the rotor , and eventually you can exploit the centrifuge .
it &apos;s the living self , the doctor , the doctor -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; is it going to hurt if i reach you here ? &quot;
now , if we go further and look for old animals , we say 40 years or more recently , we can see that even the major thing is about the people to worry about .
we should call them what it is , which is a commercial in the process , a commercial , which is rapidly known as an ecological capital that enables this production .
we can study whether we can use carbon dioxide that could just be put into production , converted co2 into the fuel , to drive this process .
so when i started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
if people would take this congestion , i mean , it seems to be all on the head , everything we believe in terms of tax policy and so on .
it depends on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s how it would be the opposite of the first ever , and formula .
but in the mid- &apos; 90s , we realized that we were at the creator of the creator -- and design -- what we were actually starting to do was actually -- we were starting to prepare .
this is what looks like , who has no willingness , can not be moved to its actions and maintain the main responsibility to the responsibility , and therefore he &apos;s unable to calculate .
since i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and that &apos;s why my palette is going to have much more music nuances , more nuances of emotions and emotion than today .
they &apos;re also looking at an artistic aspect of biological materials , and , yes , electronics , and they &apos;re combined in a fairly bible way .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of deep sea , even in the flat ocean , is so amazing to life as we can &apos;t really imagine .
then the volume of the semantic connection and the feet that are out of it , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic network of network .
i &apos;ve recently done a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that make a typical americans a typical day is 70 .
a couple of weeks later , the fireman received a letter home of household in which she used to use for the tapestry at the rescue of her house .
the food that a chef or a cookie has been carried in a cochlear , has to be eaten and not only looking at or receptacle .
you should talk about this innovation strategy , and you would be smiled by the smiling , which are provided for these innovative innovations .
and if you want to go over 20 , three percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the performance right now , you have to turn off the el .
and then we cut a v.d off of burning , and the burning of the laser , and then it &apos;s trying to focus on this camera .
of course , the chance of randomly available instructions is very small that , in case , they &apos;re not going to be able to do this .
that means that instead of remind us individually , we have standardized , common , common patterns of memories that we can relate to our personal memory .
and yet , the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , which is the remarkable clean coal technology that you see here , is changing everything .
so by the way , i sent them home , i started a quiet voice to myself trying to tell me , &quot; you don &apos;t do good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
what do you believe in the average capacity for a cardiologist or a nurse or an orthopedic , a bug , a rescue assistance ?
this is a people who are not cognitive between the colors and green , because the sky is lining the forest that depends on people , is equally different .

they enabled us to tell the story of neuromarketing , as we tell the story in this movie , that you use mris to make the fun of the brain &apos;s brain , both advertising and movies .
so i started thinking , and so i think , with safety , in the last few months , as i was working on the book , it &apos;s going to be soon -- as the dangerous , excellent , i thought that was very expected of my success .
both in my profession with rose , as well as in my back office as a volunteer man , i &apos;m a witness of larity and friendly friendship , but i also see the fruit of love and single mutation .
suppose they live in a particular remote area , and they locked a loved one of the people with aroused heart disease and refers to one of these cardiologists whose average cardiovascular performance is at 200 times .
but when i was with him , and he asked him why he made this intervention -- it was high surgeries -- his answer was that in his country , these kids would be very bad , and so he had to do it .
and when , of course , when it &apos;s intuitively something intuitive , and how can i take as an age , and just make things so that they &apos;re able to create a user interface , so they &apos;re intuitive , because they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re just too .
it &apos;s a system where there are two fundamental positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t . those who do sleep , and those who prepare , and they don &apos;t have the limitations , with bad results , and the good results .
it also has three big problems . the cost , especially in high-cost countries , which is high , and the question of security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human labor , that the fuel is not used to be used for weapons .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we have fear of real gas , and it keeps millions of people out of flourishing .
now , to decide not to buy a glass meline is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our tador -- but it turns out that the decision-making problem also affects us in very rich decisions .
i don &apos;t have to adjust that emotionally , because it &apos;s going to be a different kind of crazy , colorful , colorful surrounding the outfit , just waiting for me if i love a little bit of hearts and it &apos;s going to work .
so that &apos;s one effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we have less satisfaction with the outcome of choice than if we had the opportunity to choose between less choices .
this is a photograph that i took on the north side of the bathroom islands , when i went to the ufos of the whale hunt chart , and this man , aolya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of memory itself , and you can think of the memory of yourself as a self , which is kind of a living thing , which doesn &apos;t need the living itself .
i mean , if i &apos;m alone , i &apos;ll do all kinds of weird stuff , but then i &apos;ll go up to other people , and i &apos;ll listen to all these things because i don &apos;t want to get it to open , or frankly , they disappear .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to do more strictly and less likely to use , but in the average , that number is going to climb every year and more than double the number of services per person .
i met these people from grass , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to inject a light on any surface , and then to draw with a laser pointer , which is only registering the surface .
so , what that means is when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and especially as we look into the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
so there &apos;s big challenges here . there &apos;s challenges in transmission , and if we say , for example , that the energy source is outside of the country , they don &apos;t just need to use the technology , they also have to deal with the risk that the energy comes from somewhere else .
but , as we think , the only way that biology does a big impact on the cost of food , or restriction of its availability is , if we look at co2 material , and so we &apos;re working on these cells .
and i started working through scientific literature about how these centrists will be built in nataspiration , and found that they are structured in so-called kaskazi , and each cascade contains 164 centrists .
now the amazing thing is that the beetle karboline , which is in the liane , mao-inhibitors of exactly the way , which is necessary to question the tamtrine . so you ask yourself .
this is a problem , because the warming of the frozen reason for the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s a big amount of frozen carbon , which , if it &apos;s tested up from micromethane .
and what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of the attack was actually , really slowly , to make it happen -- obviously , in trying to allow the trial of warfare , so that you wouldn &apos;t be able to get into it quickly .
so maybe german from this technological change , because the fact that there &apos;s always been a different truth , which is that every person in society can give something special and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt to the human being is our biggest one .
my good friend ray short-term showed us that every tool that will be doubled the information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , makes it big , and the price performance rate , and the price performance of every 12 to 12 months .
the first project we did as an international group , as we were , as we were aware of ourselves , o.k , there are now a real scene here , and we are online , and we know the people that are always there and so forth .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell you that you &apos;re never going to walk , and never be as moving as others , or that you could never have a independent life , and since you &apos;ve just been distorted . &quot;
what if we could turn that situation around , and put the internet on the head so that instead of going from one to another , we can start to go from lots of things to lots of things , and by detecting patterns of patterns , what would the otherwise be ?
this is what we feel so guilty about earth , that we say , there &apos;s no bio-landing , no bioluminescent , no prostate progression and no progression , and how all of them allow us to go back to our own excrete .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i found something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in individual organisms , divided every cell , and all the genetic information of the cell goes into both dead cells .
and that was worth it for me for all of these things in the clean space , because they checked , the massmic difference between a single atom and metal is just as much as the difference between the metal and all the difference .
and i got up to six thousand news , and then we got together with friends of mine , and then i became the launch of the solar-solar-electrified company , which then became the spin-off of the spine of one of the largest cellular manufacturers in the world .
at the time , it was just like a monkey ront , where askus , and others said , you know , you know , you &apos;ve got to read the insane , if the people want to read , they want to talk about the afternoon , and that &apos;s totally fine .
if you have a darkness in spain , something that &apos;s done , something magic has done : allah , ol√© , ol√© , ollah , allah , great , brown fiber optic , because it &apos;s a whisper view of god .
so what &apos;s going on in &quot; the violin , &quot; is that everything from above up to the bottom , from the very beginning to the beginning , is completely compared to margin -- from the front of the movie that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the marx .
and the message is , well , we have to reject on these rotates , if we kind of forced our goals , twenty percent , 20 percent , tripled , three , three percent , and so if we want to do the first thing .

that &apos;s where -- what i &apos;ve been doing is i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is made of normal letters that we use for symbolic symbolic -- and i &apos;ve written my visitation on a piece of dna , and it &apos;s about 10 times more embedded .
and i wonder today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful girl has shaped my own image , and i could imagine as a way of looking for me as a powerful nature and lethic human being .
and that &apos;s where you &apos;re going to go from my physician , so that it can recognize where my weight problem is , and it &apos;s not just in the moment that i need cardiac support , or something like that , but also with a glimpse in the past .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early &apos; 80s , when i just started out with the elementary school , and it started to build my family outside my family circle , and also to reform in terms of other children and children around the world .
it &apos;s a picture of the first parking lot , which brought the whole wheel back to the lhc , then , with a part of the lhc , to release a weapon of particles on the detector .
he got 400,000 of his people around , because he was lifted to make the red , bone marrow and lemon , much more effective oil than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can break down the course of aids .
and finally , i believe that even though it &apos;s so dramatically and so inspiring , and so inspiring , we &apos;re not going to be measured at the end of our technology , not the things that we develop , not in our intellect and minds .
what i &apos;m instead doing , and what the designers of designers are doing , is we think of a certain abstract , transfer this machine , and the machine does something that makes our skills far better , and we could do it faster than we could .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 shops in the world , with students , and architects , even ctos who have done 50-odd companies , and there &apos;s something about this task , which gives deep insight into nature , and i want to share with you some of them .
and you can see that , if you look at our seven senses that most of us have just five , it &apos;s actually already seven , you know , there &apos;s certainly in the next future , the next meaning of being , and as extending ourselves again .
what you have to do is , maybe it &apos;s easy , but it &apos;s not . you have to have to have all the co2 that comes out of the burning of the box , it &apos;s captured under pressure , and then you hope that it &apos;s there .
and how about a miracle , he took his mind and started to play some of the contents of inconcerts , and then asked me to play , you know , &quot; dolphins , irisi , silius .
i committed to the place , and to his brother and his father -- with the words , &quot; well , my proposal is , tony &apos;s going to talk , we &apos;re going to come up with him a device , and we &apos;ll find a way to make his art again . &quot;
now i have to stand up when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex , sex / sex , death , death appeared -- it seemed pretty reasonable to be at the time , but at every time , it came to my two-thirds .
i &apos;m a student historians , and in this case , i studied how people went to anatomy -- meaning human body -- human body , animal bodies -- how they went with body size , with body concepts ; how they thought about body .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the minister of health , who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to take my experts to mammography , &quot; or any loan salty salmon , who wants to treat his patients with caffs .
so now , if i do that , the profiles on the ground , then , you know , there &apos;s some hazard samares , and then they &apos;re going to turn this method , and then they can say , o.ok , this hak belly to this person .
he revealed the dog and improvised an irreversible , took the skeleton of the dog and improvised a bad , relaxed dog , and turned over the ice sheet with the sheet knife at the knife .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- is it grew up or amesia twenty twenty twenty -- it &apos;s often adapted by surgeons in the norm , it &apos;s not because it would be for their physical health .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like follows . centuries , in the deserts of north america , people seem to be dressed with holy fees and music that have been collected for hours -- until mortgage .
so i also wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; frankenstein , &quot; why they believed that molecules were going on a certain kinds of randomly inhibited in nature .
and then the next one that we &apos;ve been working with nem neural model , or mental model , like the software of the software , which is , you &apos;ve got a notion of something that &apos;s going to use to use the metaphor of a desktop to use the computer .
the spirits can be complained by the great water , answers to the rhythm of the dance , to extend the soul of the living presence of the living , so that the olyth is going to be a short moment for god .
it was on a piano curriculum for music in my beloved teacher , professor jolds , a known beethoven convenient specialist , and slow professor of music here in high school .
but this is my prototype that my prototype , but it was quite exhausted , so on a thing that was going on , electronics and pressure , and that was the pressure , but the pressure was too broken .
we took a ps3-camera , we built them out , we put them on a led light , and now we have a device available free -- you can build it yourself , we can put the code to the software you can download free .
we &apos;re going to look inside this net , the fifth grade , and if it &apos;s going to get nine feet of comma , we &apos;re going to catch a few valves , then we &apos;re going to go back to a bible little bit , we &apos;ll get back into it .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars into technology and design , to take a year off and work out in an environment , which is pretty much what they actually hate , we &apos;ve got them to work in the government .
in which we did this simple thing , there was one increase in the participation of 20 percent , and there was one increase in the number of people who were willing to save , or a four percent , and they were ready to pay for the savings .
there are evidence that already the neanderthal of 60,000 years ago , older people and people with severe embodied injuries , and that might have happened because the life expectancy in the survival of these people was valuable to society .
now , we have three verbs of versions , which bring people to the grid , for a bike stakeholder , for the thumb of stakeholders , rather than giving them to the options .
the idea is , imagine what we &apos;re doing again with people to do something and to change the environment -- almost something we call it , like , &quot; clouds , &quot; how do you build an incision , but with a cloud .
and so , yeah , you see , it &apos;s relatively heterogeneous , so that &apos;s what people are doing , that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing alone , to the big organizations , to the larger organizations , that are already doing more in institutional form .
and to me , the question is , what are we going to do , because our science advances in the field of nuclear power , is that we need to get a point where we need to admit that democracy could fall into anatomy , what could we do ?
i graduated in the degree , and i hope that the video works , a very , very nice project , which is the bachelorelor &apos;s work of michael burk , kathralli , jordan and trigger .
and it gets even better , the things that you have , and i spend several thousand dollars -- gps , gps video and video , and i &apos;m going to give you a picture of books , and i &apos;m going to give you books , and i &apos;m going to give you some books , and i &apos;m going to give you guys , and i &apos;m going to give you some medical imaging technology , and i &apos;m going to be able to be diagnosed with medical imagery .
heinrich , because you assume that he &apos;s male -- even though i haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s with xy -- because he takes that he &apos;s male , he can now be attracted , which is not going to worry about maria .
finally , a sequence of buying a bad seat , if there &apos;s only one way of buying it , that if you &apos;re unsatisfied , and you wonder why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is real . what could you do ?
&quot; as we were fighting in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted to do everything , but what we needed to most was hope , hope , a mental health , the willingness , sometimes to be more hopeless and to be witness . &quot;
here you have this censorship between the unconscious and the conscious , which is immediately , without doing something about it , and the things that you know that you look very differently , so that you can make a lot better for you and others .
and i think that the interactive media that we see in archaeological models , cognitive models , so the patterns that have been programmed in our biological memory are very , very long at the time , and that we can just get through interactive media .
afternoon , the old tyrannian civilization , the caribbean coastal coastal plain , and then the consequence of this group moved from a volcanic canic canadian , moving back over the caribbean level .
and before the background , i got into the area of the interface , so the next generation of computers in the computer , in the relationship of the computer , is how our tools are changing , or how the computer is changing from the computer to digital assistance .
and i know that some of you will say , &quot; isn &apos;t it that better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place , if we all talk about a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be this language ? let &apos;s be canadian . let &apos;s be a better place .
so , you go to the house and you search for paper , and the poem goes through it , and you get a pencil when you go through it , and then she said -- she was like , you know , it was going to be with your hand , and you can get it out .
if i were to take that agreement , i would be born into a world that someone like me as a person who would perceive their life in a more positive way , but today i &apos;m going to have the opportunities and the adventure i &apos;ve experienced .
that was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and just to discover , just look and look , immediately ; immediately , personalized characteristics of visible and access to information , especially what business costs -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
we have this live plan , we have these things that we want to make in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to do a rich hand , and it wasn &apos;t doing all the teeth that i wanted to flick all the things that i wanted to do and never did .
if we change the plastics , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water storage , that they can go back to cellulosic base , then they can go back to a baby in israel or in tunisia in hundreds of hundreds of thousands of trees .
and it turns out that in a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a great representative sample , among 60,000 dollars a year .
i think it may seem to be more clear that we don &apos;t necessarily have to be overwhelmed , but we &apos;re open to the poor , to use them on the sheep , to use a champion , and maybe even dance with it .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary diversity and beauty and beauty , but also the heart of darkness -- the space of an enormous decline since the decades of raw decades , and devastated as many lives as the first world war .
so this whole discussion , as is going to go down at the moment -- and energy , like this , is going to go to the island that we have , for example , the fifth five to three percent accuracy , so we need the wind and the sun .
so we started with a couple of volunteers who were starting to do something more than a year ago in seattle who would mark things that they would call them -- different kinds of things that they could see -- things that they would throw away from .
tan tan le , anonymous ponder from scray , was now woodle , refugee and social activist , was invited to the suburbs that they had never heard of , and in their homes , whose existence you could never have imagined .
you know , they knew that every year about 75,000 hondures to leave their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in honduras .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy grows in italy with this picture in his room , but the reason why i &apos;m showing you this is because this is the formula in the past a very interesting thing .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermal sources , and sometimes i &apos;d never seen before , i &apos;d never seen things that had never seen before , and no one had ever seen before , and for the science at the time , when we saw them , we didn &apos;t even have words .
we believe that polemik -- we believe that poet &apos;s not persuasive , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our 35 million people are in the world .
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be in terms of people in terms of people , because i have to admit that i know a series of real trips that probably may be more social than some people i know .
and this is , and this is what we need to see on millions of faces of problem-solving all over the world , if we take the hills of the next century , the face of the attack , the face against all the drift of an episode of episode .
what &apos;s different to children is that they &apos;re starting with the marshmallow and prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow , so that they have the ability to repair the ability to fix them .
and then there are things that are already totally involved in everyday life , but most people don &apos;t realize , for example , for example , that allow us to go with four-degree executives , are also genetic optimists .
and then they go to the consumer electronics business to assemble a stereo system -- speaker , cd , a cd player , a rugged radio , stronger , stronger , and in this one electronics , there &apos;s so many stereo .
i find that they were so denious and strong , and so radical in what they did , that i took all of the years to see the maltese crap in the 1776 , and it &apos;s not because of music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
what we have learned from cultural outcomes is that women , in the average -- not every average , but in the average -- more complex social relations and social relationships for people who are advocating within the group , are very , very , very aware of giving them a lot of attention .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i spoke to a few years ago , who had a few six-word twins to separate them in a way to make a name .
in order to enable that theories , we call ourselves in memory , that it &apos;s definitely highly gratified , it has to be a high-end goal , and it &apos;s probably very likely to be done in iran , because most of the infections have been registered .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you think about the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in engineering , whether you have to have that available , if things are going to get faster , or that innovation , you need more than we expect .
this was a huge ending up at the time , because of course , you start to emphasize the living language of manifest in form , which means what fluid , and i &apos;m alive , and i &apos;m going to do it in stone and manipulate it , so i also do it .
as the golden cat , her 10-dollar business , she got rid of the most recent catastrophic , she said that the winning winner was about 87 percent -- a result of the rise , the rise of the numbers and reducing reducing the cost of cost .
so the tedtalk , in a very simple form , is that a charter city is a place where there is an inhabited country , a founded by the laws that govern the laws there , and that people can either choose to choose to live under those rules or not .
we followed the genetics eight generations back and found two accidents of a natural death , and when we asked people to do something about it , they said that one of the people was so old that he died because of his old age , and we still killed him with the spears .
but if we look at these metabolic card card , which is very simple , compared to our trust , and i think it &apos;s simple , but if we look at all the genes that we can get after the other , it &apos;s very unlikely to lead to a living cell .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose this wish , the power of energy , is not going to have any carbon dioxide . this wish i am .
this is what it looks like when he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really seeks , is somebody who is free , when he &apos;s inflated , because he knows , he &apos;s not very good at the brand when he &apos;s covered by a snow .
at this point , patients come to the game . they can &apos;t take control of the control , they can be on their own ship , but we can also help us deal with health care in the face of health care , and the cost of public health care , and so on .
and then there &apos;s a memorial of self , and the memory itself is itself , which is chosen , and the story of our life gets upright , and it &apos;s the one who speaks the doctor by asking the question , &quot; how did you feel in the last time ? &quot;
now in the world of the savings , i think one of the best examples that recently came out of the market is how to say the best choice of choice , something about david lason has been very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered in harvard .
about an hour after they came home , after i finished the home , they collapsed , they collapsed the family , and the family called 11 rescue , and the rescue rescue brought them back to the emergency station of a blood pressure , which is a dangerous state .
but i remember the lights of oil spills in front of the malayan coast , and on the young man that broke up and died the end of the journey was too much for him , and on the first taste of the tape that gave me one of the men on the platform .
now , what this thing does is that it starts the data from sensors -- so for example , from printing sensors and vibrational sensory sensors -- and it provides legitimacy to the code , while it &apos;s running up with the wrong data .
how can these people come from a flora of 80,000 species of adolescent plants that have not found these two morphologically unrelated plants that combined when they combine this way , a kind of biochemical version , so that the whole thing is larger than the sum of its parts ?
and there was a time when there was only one jeans in the way , and they bought it , and they were bad , they were incredibly comfortable , and if they had long compatible enough , and often enough , they &apos;d started to feel &quot; ok . &quot;
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t perceive that there are only three fingers at the bottom : because the minds and the way that it works , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three , but it looks as a group .
and these sounds and this rhythm and this rhythm have shown the topography , which is a region of a region , and of course , that you could also enable those songs to be able to put these songs together , and they could move to the left , and they could move back to the right , and then they could move back to the gangallery .
i also believe that there are theories that are beginning to understand how everything started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplistic story of what &apos;s called &quot; the oil spill &quot; is that the little oil spill around , which includes different kinds of receptions for chemicals .
how often do we have a political leader -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we reject ourselves back and we expect the government to reflect our reflection and our needs , and then it doesn &apos;t change a lot ?
this could now happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years were used by hundreds of years , because this evolutionary information had to be learned about the individuals who died of these fruit , because these information structures weren &apos;t there .
for example , there &apos;s the anecdotal that the report of a chapter like that , where the area of this large fishery , can &apos;t be used , or by fishermen , it &apos;s usually not going to be done because it &apos;s not scientific . &quot;
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people will be convicted by general , but the ethnocity , the destruction of human life , is not only being convicted , but by general and many , as a developing strategy .
what if you were to change the sperm and the eggs and the eggs or the fresh fruit could change your kids to give a better chance for a healthy life -- the diabetes of diabetes , the diabetes , the helpless of cancer , the risk of cancer ?
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are places that are thermal heaven , and by the way , the hot button survivors would be if fish were there , it would have convicted to the specific areas , yet they could make a habitable environment for themselves .
the great genetics in the 20th century , t.g. doctor , who was also a communication kant in the russian doorthodox , once wrote a set of titles that doesn &apos;t make sense of biology except for evolution in evolution . &quot;
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have a few minutes of power that the living life itself is alive , and you have begun to do that the memory of a patient itself is much better , because now you have a better patient about his experience .
so not only do you have a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals , not just one farm , which measures their success of their health , but a farm that is literally an underwater facility , and not only for those fish , but for me and for you .
you have to understand that as a translator , not just as a word for the word &quot; text &quot; in a different language , &quot; but also the deep sense of words and the words of the day , and so that there &apos;s a meaningful transfer of sensory translation , which has to do with foreign languages .
and if i go back to a step again , and i look at everything , i can restore my lost to my search for the past , and here i have a nice timeline , i &apos;m looking for a little bit , i &apos;m looking for live here or live here after live labs .
now , what you could do with a patient , and we actually did clinical trials , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s been done , you know , you could actually make the reflection of a length by just letting the end up with no adds .
you do it by the challenge , the challenge , the challenge , the ocean , and the ocean is the most challenging environment , the ones you have . you can do it because of the discovery , and because of the strange connection that happens when a small group of people are educated .
i took them up and i added them to access the world at the bottom : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in such extreme situations , and i took them to the sources of sources so they could take samples and test instruments and so on .
you understand that it &apos;s not just that means that people have to eat dog food if they go to the retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go back to the money , it means that the decisions is so hard to make large that they miss large investments of their employers .
and over the course of this period , you &apos;re going to have cultural values in your society , the values that hold your calculus , that your prayers and your prayers , just your prayers , your cosmic -- or we might say the ecological weight -- that &apos;s weight .
the leaders of the honored government in honduras would be proven to the help of partnership , they could benefit from their partnerships that they would provide on the laws of charter for this charter and the charter , that everyone can trust the charter that the charter will really be done .

he was driving up with high speed when he suddenly a little fragment of a melody that sounds like the wheel , often it &apos;s hard for him to get older , and he wants to have it . she &apos;s full of praying . he &apos;s still able to do it , but he can &apos;t touch it .
another example : a few years ago , i received the phone call of a 19 man who was born as a boy , when he had a boy , he had a friend who lived with his girlfriend , and he just found that he had failed , and he had a mother .
but there &apos;s only one company , an agent ready to help us -- and that &apos;s just because i know john bond and richard shenshopping tree for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to deal with the texting and directly to go to my team .
in fact , i &apos;ve been looking at the greatest part of my career to a terrifying situations , and that all for trying to look at trying to figure out how they are , and hopefully they &apos;re interesting , and hopefully , in a way , to find out what they &apos;re doing for the audience and making it accessible .
and this curiosity also showed me that whenever i was in school , i wasn &apos;t in school , through the forests of the lawyers , traveled , &quot; samples , &quot; frogs , frogs and snakes and beetles , and everything would go home , and put it under the microscope .
she ran like the devil house , as she was pursued by this poem , and it was only about the fact that she had to get enough to a piece of paper and a pen , so she had to get it , if she was able to catch it through donnesses , and put it on the sheet .
the next weeks , i made it forward , and i went to the first time , the healthy dogs that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself , not the kind of healing of shame that you can &apos;t talk about it , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
now , i like a little extreme , you know , you know , how little i appeared on the toes of memories , but even if you have more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give a lot of memories to the weight of the mind that we give ?
you can think of this cultural life as an ethnic sphere , and ethnic sphere can be defined as the total sum of all thought and dreams , myths , myths and intuitions that have been imagined by the human imagination since the emergence of consciousness , defined by the ability of consciousness .
so where the founding fathers were extremely challenged to figure out how individuals can be protected from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re going to give more a concept of not just how to protect them , but how we can make them for each other .
the main reason for this is that we might be able to choose this huge shelf of mayan mayan , senior age and marg , but we don &apos;t see the same thing , and then we can actually choose something from the fantastic deal .
by playing music and talking about music , it was from this paranoid , confused , the man who had just moved through the streets of los angeles , a loving , defeated , dedicated , smiling , in juiler &apos;s recorded musician .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life was the tom of the embodiment of modern artistic artist who tried to control this uncontrolling creative impulse that would allow him to deal with them and to deal with them .
now i &apos;m going to describe to you a study that i &apos;ve seen with gur hubert , eena camica , jewish ji , who we were able to make decisions for the savings for almost about a million americans from about 650 places in the united states .
the reason for that is , if i would draw it on a normal curve , where we say , this is the years , so the timeline of a way , and this is a very popular technology that i want to share with a gray graph , then the graph is going to be mountains .
and if i think about it , i think about a vacation that we made a few years ago in antarctica , which was the most clear one i &apos;ve ever had , and i often think of it in terms of how often i think of other people .
and maybe a small view of what might happen in a few decades , if you have cyborg body to study something or other things , in all sorts of human-like ways that i can think of as a science fan fan of sciences .
a lot of companies tend to -- and this is the human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re going to avoid , those elements , and that they &apos;re welcoming , and they &apos;re going to change them , and they &apos;re actually turning them into something positive , and that &apos;s a hockle storyteller .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like the case of iran , in the case of iran , where a man who feels sexually too sexually open to other men , with death , it &apos;s going to be ready , because he &apos;s ready to move to a gender environment where he can stay alive .
and you &apos;re going to be locked by the use of the tribe of the tribe , and you &apos;re going to be better educated by the khanging academy , and by the way , and by doing that , you &apos;ll have the possibility of going to have 3-printing and using it , and so much more productive than ever before .
now we know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t take a line between male and female , or between male and sexually interdependence and sexual interdependent ; we are , of course , the line of course .
so if you look at google glass for example , it &apos;s such a concept , which will allow us to combine the virtual world with the real world , which is called the inherent , which is the virtual , as a virtual , to find something natural , again , recommend .
for some time , i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect , and it may seem strange that a magician is interested in it , because it &apos;s like , you know , i think , as a &quot; deception &quot; is going to be a deception if somebody just believes enough on it . &quot;
we &apos;ve been working with roberto rover , one of the best ballet dancers of our time -- the √©empiration at the metropolitan theater in new york , and the scala in mailand -- we &apos;ve taken his movements in 3d to use them as an impulse for the flylation .
there are some mushroom projects that build this on 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to get very difficult for 100 percent , and it &apos;s going to be hard to get a deal of the co2 , which is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the problem .
so what you got , you know , was this : your name was here : my tedtalk talk , which you have no idea what your topic is going to be , and the consensus of the content that you can fly around the obesity , especially if i &apos;m involved in your company for your dumb .
and in this song , we will be able to rediscover the possibility of what we are , people with consciousness , who are important to realize that all the people in this room can become a gesture . and there &apos;s great moments of optimism bias .
these older people come to me now , and they say , &quot; mr , venson , they talk , they tell you . they tell people that they &apos;re supposed to stop saying that we should have the first time to do it in the history of our terrorism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
now , the people in the back , or the people who are going to see that later on , will say , &quot; well , that looks pretty much like this , but if it was real , it would be -- you see , there &apos;s a hole here , and if it was really , it would be blueprinted . &quot;
so as a result of this , it &apos;s especially vulnerable to these schizophrenics , and sometimes the bad ones are so bad , and he disappears in the streets of skull around the streets , and it &apos;s always threatened by this hormone of his own minds .
he spoke in a very hot and he talked about youn-yo and hillary clinton and about how the dodgers would never do it in the world , and because of all the passenger pigeons in the first set of beethoven &apos;s fathers .

i wanted to go to the routine , and the cross-comfort of the life of a unknown animal -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , who have been able to hold each of their days as a result of their stories a day , and we &apos;re still sleeping in the same bed .
but we don &apos;t even think about it , if we listen to someone like this , because we &apos;ve been able to know this kind of error for so long , somehow we have the notion of assuming and collective that creativity and suffering , of course , is that art -- and at the end of the seal .
and what we &apos;ve been doing was actually using a new kind of network of network that has been used all over the world -- this is a mobile web -- and anonymous and anonymous information from this network that &apos;s been collected from the neover to understand how the city works .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s take the human individual in the center of the universe -- all mysteries and mysteries , and there &apos;s no more space for myriad , the feathers of gods .
in our desire to protect the people who are on the heart and tell them the calendar truth about their medical formulas or even a forecast to the quality of the quality of life , we have to admit that we don &apos;t miss the baseline , that somebody is actually disabled .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques , which is the problem of decision-making -- restricted -- you &apos;re going to get the overlapping alternatives ; concrete concrete -- it &apos;s real categories ; it &apos;s better -- we can deal with more categories , more options ; less of complexity .
because we have this self-deception , this sense of being great , trigger of the highest creatures , not one of these kinds of flavors , of something so uncomputable , like a organism , which is still a rock , and it &apos;s unprecedented for us .
and that is , if you all have your feelings of politics and the long of the work , and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about , we &apos;re really excited about , government , in the words of tim berlly , what we &apos;re doing in common , we can &apos;t do it alone .
that may seem a little bit abundant , so i repeat it , so i can make it work , so that if we can solve problems like hunger , global poverty , global conflicts and obesity , i think , we need to try to play online for at least 21 billion hours a week to play the end of the next decade .
and our goal was , we just wanted to get to seven-percent renewable renewables , and then the rest of the last 10 , the last 10 percent , 20 percent renewable , is going to be very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work out of the batteries .
but , in fact , 17 marking partners who were willing to report on these control , who wanted to do business with somebody who wanted to do business as they were , and what i felt like , and who eventually told us to tell stories that we could not have -- stories that would usually support a makeup .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never simulate any reasonable simulations , whether it &apos;s going to work , but there are modern computer computers , you can simulate it , and you can see that , yes , with the real material technology , it looks like it &apos;s functional .
but the process , and the severe climbing , which was surrounded , was when he took the genius out of it , where he didn &apos;t take a lot of the trouble , and then he would come back to him where he would come from , and he would not realize that it had to be an elderly , old thing .
this curious event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called pray , pray , pray , who , who decided that when all my books came out of any given world and went to a big meme event , international acquire thing .
a continent is always gone out , because the guess was that there was no religious faith in sub-saharan africa , and of course there was a vooo and odoo is simply the remaining of this very profound religious thought , while the tragedy of slavery was over time .
but in fact , we see it more and more and more , if you &apos;re willing to go anywhere , and the most important opportunities are going to be unequal , now there &apos;s an increase in the numbers that are going to pay , and there &apos;s r &amp; amp ; d , and there &apos;s a improvement of success .
and one day , he watched me in one of my practices -- these practices were simply tired and nadend -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a powerful , powerful , powerful man , you &apos;re one of those fears .
and the wind and wind and the sun and the load came through and came to the outcome , a very exciting outcome of the conclusion that you get to the conventional system , after 20 years , you have a middle footprint of about five kilowatts per kilowatts , which takes about four cents a half cents .
and the problem , it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can be just a access to what &apos;s going on , so things like a simple bible problem , a problem , a question , and how do you do that , or how to do it better .
more than planting grain of plant food , damaging treatment to monocultures , chemicals on earth , chickens on fish , and all the time the agricultural industry just asked , &quot; if we feed people more cheaper , how can that be terrible ? &quot;
not through the latest rescue resonance and tractory inventors , but through fruit land , not pumping pumps , but through fresh water , not through chairs , but through forests , and not by fishing boats and boats , but by fish and fish , but through the sea .
so these are an artistic direction , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and artists and collaboration with scientists to deal with these technologies , and to ask the question , and to process the creative process , because there &apos;s museum , you know , there &apos;s all sorts of things .
and they summarize the amount of carbon that leads to the temperature , which is rising at the temperature , and that temperature has a lot of negative implications , which has some very negative effects on the weather , and maybe worse , and the indigenous indigenous indigenous fact that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t change the changes in such as the whole systems and so on .
you know , up-attribute things are things that are verted , like the prince , the prince , the tice , the aboughts , dropped , you , you know , the logic , you know , the things that are magically , and the myal , like gandhi .
it wasn &apos;t easy to paint with others ; it wasn &apos;t enough . they ran enough , and they ran and ran and ran , but they didn &apos;t get the house and the poem through them , and they walked through them , and she said it would go on land , and say , you know , it was going to searching for another poet .
now , this may be a modern-day contribution , and if you &apos;re going to do it better than i expect , that would be great , but my core point here is that we have to work on all five people , and we can &apos;t give them any of them up , because they have all the significant problems .
and where you can see how far we can get away from what we really wanted and how sad are we that are at all on earth , you can see that , for example , there &apos;s a program to be a 20 to 20 , you know , you want to be here , you want to be trajectory ? yeah ?
in my 2020 years of the medical sensation and journalism , i made a personal medical error about medical error and false treatments to make everything for my first article that i did for the &quot; star show , &quot; black show , black show , &quot; learn how to learn .
so , with the total transparency of transparency , which is the new thinking , which is what the old thinking on the old bang , don &apos;t tell you , that in the laser meat , and no longer cattle is meat or other phenomena , which i just want to do that , and that wants to do the knee .
now , not exactly what i hoped to do , but i went up -- the stairs , the floods , the floods , along the real firemen who were over the course of this day , who were quite ready to get quite done in the bedroom into a pair of shoes .
i had to finally get away with these thick , elevators -- in different colors -- that you know , to build my leg , and i hated these more than anything else . i hated them . i lost them . i gave them . i hated them .
but we wanted to go a lot further . we wanted to build a total bacterial chromosome , and it has more than 50,000 letters code , so we thought we were building it in the size of the virus , which we could understand the size of the cassets to understand what the individual component of a living cell .
and from a conversation in this morning , you know , one of the innovators of the dad , i want to share something with you -- he gave me the permission -- his technological , &quot; the slums , &quot; and many of you may have heard of it . it &apos;s the size of a refrigerator student .
&quot; cloud-winning &quot; -- something that my friends in autodesk call &quot; high-tech &quot; -- sensors , sensors and networks , 3d printing , that allow us to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , vaccine , food and digital food , nano-engineered materials and artificial intelligence .
you can see this amazing demonstrations : voodoo &apos;s ecology in a state of transfer , the light bulbs with no burning , an amazing illustration of the mind of the mind so that this is going to be able to prepare in an extreme condition .
this was the hardest shape of a d√©jo de vu , which i &apos;ve ever experienced . because before i got a corner of the corner , i always knew what was going on in the light bulb of the vehicle , i was going to go up because i was monthly movie , when we turned the movie .
so in this picture , i have a bus as a center of desperation in all directions , because if you look at the way of life , all the specialists in the way that these two branches have succeeded in evolutionary success : they &apos;ve survived ; it &apos;s got its environment and demonstrates .
and so , with this premise , with this premise , with this premise , you know , brian degger was trying to put together in england , a minimum hostile , and then you take a steam , and you know , it &apos;s got a coordination , you know , you know , and it &apos;s got bacteria to grow bacteria , and it &apos;s got bacteria .
and then it came from the do-it-it-o-gdp on the website , and he said , &quot; o.o. we &apos;ve got to meet now , we &apos;re really going to meet again , real , and then we have two choices , one in london , 10 , and shortly in the u.s. , in san francisco , in san francisco .
this equation has four factors . a little bit multiplied . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- you want to get the zero and the number of people depending on the number of services that everybody uses in the average person , the average person , the average energy , and the co2 , the energy consumption per unit is emitted per unit .
and the insight of president lobo was that the wisdom of the argument that i thought about as a way to get the foreign investors to come to the city and build this city meaningful capital for all the honoras in many years .
i read this list of loud friend , and i had to laugh at the first time , it was so ridiculous , but i just got to go to the court , &quot; no more to speak , and i had to stop reading and gather for the exaggeration of this falling fluid , and to get the emotional shock . &quot;
i learned a group of announara that i &apos;ve learned a little while ago , which is a student who &apos;s a college group who wanted to convey more of the public , what she wanted to learn in college , and they &apos;ve done so on the street trajectory , and try to tell people what d.c. n.a is .
there &apos;s 175 rescue in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 different extra olive eggs and 12 balconies that you could buy a large number of sales in your own sales , which is not the case that the 175 lens is right for them .
and that was very , very , very , very bitter , and you also come into this phase , and then you just put it on a picture where i asked myself , 10 thousand years after 10 years , which was still , you know , basic lovers in the collective , of course , whether this is really supposed to be so great .
so what i &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as it can , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we have as part of an exact exact year , which is a year ago , and that &apos;s seadragon , and it &apos;s an environment that &apos;s either in the localized or huge amounts of visual data .
the first thing that you &apos;re going to do when you &apos;re going to grow up as a child , as a baby , is that you &apos;re going to take care of what &apos;s going on , what are you going to fail ? and depending , depending on whether your parents are allowed to play more or less in the letting , and the more , the more , the more , the more , the curiosity , of course , is going to be curious about the earth .
i mean , i mean , most of the moments of our lives -- and i &apos;ve got this out -- you know , the psychological psychological present , for about three seconds , which means you know that there &apos;s about a million of them live in about a month . there are about 60,000 a month . most of them don &apos;t leave behind them .
bill bill bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , all of the big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we just need some 10 million . and even if we tested our materials in russia to make sure that it works in a safe , it &apos;s only 100 million people .
so this works really , it &apos;s going to be done in the academic , and we thought , well , o.k that we might have , maybe we &apos;ll have a webcam , which is going to smoke up the lens , and then you &apos;ve got a microscope , which is about a hundred times .
if i show you 600 magazines , and you put them in 10 categories , or i show you 400 magazines , and those in 20 categories , you believe that i &apos;ve given you more choices and a better experience than i gave you 400 , when i gave you 400 , if i gave you the 600 .
friday friday friday , friday friday . gowanon friday friday , friday friday friday , who &apos;s going to do it , you know , friday friday friday , friday friday friday . you didn &apos;t think we would have that conversation , without talking about this video , i hope .
i think i believe that a significant mexican -- not the only one , but a significant blessing of these depression , and also suicide , is that people have the disappointment of disappointment , because their standards are so high . and then , if you have to explain this experience , you would think it would be your fault .
the neolithic revolution that brought us agriculture to agriculture , and we found ourselves at that moment in the cult of the koran , the poetry of the anesthesia through the prosthetics and the archy of this hierarchy , and specifically , and created -- only 10,000 years ago , rather than just 10,000 years ago .
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s like when you focus a laser , you can put it into a room , and you can catch small particles in the air or in the liquid , and then you put it in that lift , so that &apos;s where you start , so , like a trajectory , you can get a toronto basically .
it would be awesome if we could take this paradigm of the normal possibilities against one of the possibilities , or the strength of the strength , even a little bit more dangerous , if we could delete it , so we can use the forces of lots of kids , and put them in a very special way , to bring their skills to the skills in society .
you know , you know , when michelangelo was shaking the mosquito , it means that he took the end of the hammer , and he was waiting for him -- in fact , you can still see a little bit of a little drunk under it -- and he said , &quot; perch√© ? &quot; why don &apos;t you get there ? &quot;
but if you go to 2011 today in 2011 , in 2011 , a new color laser printed by the leading printing press and printing a page , this site has dumped page on every page of every page in a pattern that gives you the very clear page and makes your print .
i mean , my colleague in front of you , assabies , you could take a lot more about the perceiving and tell the many other wonderful things you can do with perceive , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we &apos;re discussing at the beginning , and that &apos;s the environment that we have .
now , the problem , the problem , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us that have the sympathy for the hard condition , have you seen as orgging and colorful and colorful , but you look at the past , while the real world , our world .
and then i tried this in my lab , and i tried this in my lab , trying to figure out a little bit of a little bit , and then i got this kind of negotiation on the ebay trade , and i bought a little bit of a n.a. analysis , and i tried to get an awesome analysis , so i &apos;m going to do this like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to go home .
and if you were to choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two types of self , and you have to think about how you &apos;re going to decide that conflict , and it &apos;s not really obvious , because if you think about it at the time , and if you &apos;re going to have an answer , and if you think about it in the sense of memories you could get another answer .

i recommend you all to read steves book , or to see the movie , so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful allies that have come between these two men , but also how the music helped this connection , and how it was , when this game is allowed to get away from the middle east to get away from the street .
so here in the picture , you can see this is the lab , in leadership , so there &apos;s such a garage with so many kinds of lab that the lab , which has an imitated group in paris , which is very successful , and it &apos;s also quite interesting , because i want to cut a project for a moment .
no biologist would say , for example , for example , that 50 percent or more or more of all kinds of species are extinct , because it &apos;s not true . and yet , this apocalyptic -- the most apocalyptic scenarium on biological diversity -- hardly , which is known to us as the most optimization of the cultural diversity .
bg : well , we haven &apos;t yet displaced ourselves on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting openings for the &quot; zero &quot; in the name , &quot; and there &apos;s a big interest in the name of the company and the company in russia , china , which i &apos;ve been here , and i &apos;ve talked about how the energy source of energy is going to be .
the computer visions of the computer algorithms have given these images together to give them the real room , where these images , all over the grasslands of the grassroots were made in the canadian rock , and they &apos;re seeing elements of stallas , or pancreas , and these things were all related to each other in the relationship .
and if you look at the software that we &apos;ve just seen , you &apos;re also going to understand why nine-ninety-nine percent of our software today or intuitively , it &apos;s usable to use an ipad in many ipad regions , even though it &apos;s much more intuitive than classical software .
the result is that -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy , &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift is a shift shifting of the responsibility for somebody &apos;s decisions about something -- the name of the doctor -- to know nothing , and therefore , is probably sick , and therefore , in the best sense , to make a decision -- the patient &apos;s choice .
and this idea of retched me as i was in the middle of the talk , pray , pray . i fell in love with one of these roomics that we all fall in when we work and it doesn &apos;t work . you think it &apos;s a disaster . that &apos;s the worst book that &apos;s ever written . that &apos;s ever written .
we also have one of these same aggregate in the same size of the size , as it says , in the halfway , to actually have the entire dynamic behavior of this grid , so in halfway , it &apos;s now the back here , there &apos;s the big battery that &apos;s all the juggling that we do with the web .
they believed that a genius could believe that this kind of magic girl was the case that it was believed that it would literally live in the walls of an artisanal elite -- about as opposed to the household of the household -- the artist and the work of the work that would be invisible , and the outcome of the work that would make it happen .
if i want to give you one of the things that i want to show you today is that the overall data that we consume is larger than the sum of their parts , and instead of thinking about information translation , i want you to think about how we can use information so that we can be able to figure out patterns , and we have the trends that are not seen .
so we did a study in a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessro , and we did a study where we did a study of people who worked for all -- and these people were all locked in a collection in which they made their retirement plan for their savings .
well , interesting historical footnote : when the mosque of south spawning brought them into this use of use . the language changed over the centuries of allah , allah , allah , allah , mool√© , makes you want to fight yourself , and you still struggle with execution and danger .
now , today , you need a race , if you want to get a race , actually something like this -- something like this -- something that &apos;s going to do in real time , some sensory sensors that have thousands of sensors from the car to the system , and then you &apos;re going to use this car and then you &apos;re going to use these things back to get things back into real time information .
i was scared , i was afraid , not because of , but i was afraid that i could lose it in one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship to the mind , if i began to destroy , and i started talking about tons of pepper and exciting , and other exciting forms of greeks that he could talk to speak in the dagogy .
so , in fact , the fact that you &apos;re going to remember the 20th century , in 300 years , not to remind your wars or technological innovation , but rather than a era in which we were against , and the massive destruction of biodiversity and biodiversity in the world , or passively accepted problem . so that &apos;s not the change .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which was written in visual effects of visual effects and computer generalized effects in a whole new way , with realizing human expression , expressive character that were made by middle cg , and the characters should be all the main . and the world should be the world . and the world should be cg .
i probably hear about the two nearest girl , because i hear about the generation of the generation that &apos;s been hearing for this bad image , because i &apos;ve already been able to study hundreds of thousands of unfolds that are already beginning to study commodity machine , which is high school , i think , today , you know , i think it &apos;s a good one .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a fragile answerer review after one of my lectures , who said a story , &#91; unclear &#93; &#91; unclear &#93; , he said , and it was absolutely gorgeous music , and at the end of the sound , there was a cruelty of the sound of the sound .
do you know ? i think you know ? i think one person allows me to think that he thinks he or she &apos;s the fake , like that , and the essence and the source , the divine , creative , unknown , mysterious , mysterious , is a little bit of responsibility to give you a fraction of a human mind , the citizens .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and at the same time , the co2 will also say , &quot; skeptic , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s not an emitting co2 , i almost wish it &apos;s going to take , but i &apos;m going to accept it , because it &apos;s cheaper than the method . &quot;
it &apos;s actually the kind of force that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who &apos;s going to say we had two reflections in two different surgeries and decides what to choose , then the one who has the memory , the memory has less , and that &apos;s the surgeon that &apos;s chosen , the surgeon will be chosen .
you know , all of you know who are healthy , when you give a secret of the best friend &apos;s prize , even though that one of them disappears and then you get caught in and then you get the best friend , and the best friend will confront you , and if you get a terrific discussion , if you make the bad thing you want , and you will never make a mistake like that .
you know , you know , one of the great things that travel in the traveling , and one of the pleasant research in the ethnic research is together with people who can live with people who still remember the old days , and they still feel their past the wind , they are touching from the rain that they are in the leaves of the leaves of the leaves of the leaves .
if you ever have a chance to ever have the chance to work in your city center , like our scott customer , you &apos;ll be part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;ll see all of them -- you will see that the government , because of many problems , including the instructions that include a council in your house .
in fact , the nice thing about this is , if you do that , agriculture , agriculture , biogas , makes it a hectar with fifth apartment in favelas in favelas so that it can take about a thousand dollars a hundred dollars and wait for it , and it makes the chickens and it burns and picks and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables .
we &apos;re amazing to the threshold of the threshold , amazing events in many areas , and yet i think we really need to go back hundreds of years before the enlightenment to find a time that we struggled in , where we &apos;ve been doing things about these things , more often than tricky .
so by changing color , by changing color , condensity and heroism to the individual images , photographic photography , like rocks , and color , we deflect color between the images and the different images , and the way that they look like a single photo , even a picture of old shooting .
now , if i was in a room full of colleagues with colleagues and asked their sobering support , and i told you what i just told you , i wouldn &apos;t be able to achieve the end of the story until it really would be unpleased to you , somebody would be able to get a joke , and they would forget the rest and forget the rest .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good moment to take your device , take your personal communications out of communications -- i &apos;ll give you -- and you may be able to look at a phelyn book on it , because it won &apos;t be anything else in this talk .
a few years ago , the laser prize was given to the scientist shinya shinya , who took his research into a sculptor , took a fiddler , a broad bladder , and the manipulation of only four genes that can lead them to a pluripotent stem cell -- a potentially potential cell in the body is able to be able to become a body in a cell .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve made all kinds of batteries that are made , look at the cars , computers , cell phones , lamps , everything . and i &apos;ve used the amount of electronic energy that &apos;s using the world , and i found that all batteries that we now could make less than 10 minutes .
now let &apos;s go back to a step back in the time of the big bang , 14 years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first indication of living , maybe three to three millennia , four years ago -- the first majority of organisms , maybe as much as a 800 or a billion years ago , and then the human species , which is forming in 130,000 years ago .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral emergency room , which ended up in the computer with flickr success . just give you an emergency room , and you get a picture of men in t-shirts and shirts on the university , and so on , each of these farmessence is a picture that was discovered as a model that was detected to this model .
and yet , in this country , in this country , in the old states of the old south , we &apos;re doing -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted to death , when the victories are higher , when the victory is black , when it &apos;s 22 , when the piano is black , and the victories in the same states -- in the same states , in which the real world has people .
i traveled to a young boy with a young 6,000 miles from west to china through southeast tibet , and only when i hated to lhasa , i saw the face of statistics behind the statistics of 6,000 monholy , and they turned to be 1.2 million people during the cultural revolution during the cultural revolution . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and therefore , the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of important problems in something that you have only later -- and that &apos;s the investment that &apos;s not so clear . actually , the ipc report is not necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world that look at ipcc , and this is not a big drama .
we cleaned the chromosome of the microbes of a microbial species , which are the two , as far away as people and mice , and we put some extra genes to choose this chromosome of the chromosome , and we could destroy it to destroy all of the proteins . and it was very amazing when we put it into a cell -- and they &apos;ll estimate our cell -- -- we &apos;ll be very , very likely -- here -- here -- here .
margaret mead , the great anthropologist said before she died that her greatest fear is that as we move towards the fact of an initial , unprecedented world , we don &apos;t just move the whole bandwidth of human imagination in a sense of thinking , but that we had one day come out of a dream , and we &apos;ve ever forgotten that there was no other possibilities .
i &apos;d like to just show you one of the original databases of noah , and that &apos;s by a prototype from photosynth photosynth we &apos;ve been working on in the summer to show you what i think it &apos;s really the pointing of this technology , which is synthetic technology , and it &apos;s not so obvious that if you look at the environments that we have on the website .
in other words with other words , sugar pills have shown in some measurable impact , the placebo effect of the placebo effect , which is just because the person who thinks what they &apos;re doing is a pharmaceutical pharmaceutical pharmaceuticals , or a kind of painful management , for example , if there are only enough to be an effect on the body , you call it the placement of the placebo effect .
if one of them said no , it was the vetcetp that had a completely fragrattered , and i spent 10 years having a hard time doing it , whether i &apos;m going to do it my great engineering , perhaps , to be a sweaty thing , because all of my father has talked about my father , you &apos;ve talked about it , you &apos;ve got the money on your kid for a child .
i had a recent encounter , recently , when i met the extraordinary american poet in ruth stone , who was now over 90 , but she was a whole life in her life , and she told me that when she was growing up in the villages of virginia , she was working on the field , she said , and she was going to feel like a landscape that she was talking about the landscape .
it means that a small child is growing up in the belief that the mountain is a puppet , or your destiny , will determine another human being , and a different relationship with this kind of resource , or a little bit of a montana in which the montana is growing up , that a pioneer can be a bunch of stones that can be emitted .
usually my role is the role of explaining people like wonderful technologies , which are going to be on , and i thought , well , i &apos;m here to tell you about what i &apos;m doing , and i &apos;m going to try to explain what &apos;s really going on , and trying to understand what &apos;s really going on with these amazing technologies that are going on in front of you , which are so that we can &apos;t even be able to be able to see .
and that would be , and that would be your answer to the bjs lomborg , that if you use all that time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals that suffer suffering , the reduction of malaria , and so on , that there &apos;s a dumb waste of resources , that &apos;s money to invest , while there &apos;s better things that we can do .
so these people have come online to come online , but they &apos;ve made it illegal because they have used janitors , for example , to make money out of our bank account , while we make our online banking , or keylog , the information that has collected the information on the keyboard as we have a computer online about a computer online .
every time , a woman parks came back to montgombe , where they had two of their oldest friends . these older women , johnson , who had never organized the montgoma boson -- an incredible african-american -- and a virginia league , a white husband , whose white clifford clifford clifford walker , dr. king .
and the ones and the ones have sat down there are two things like two bathers and they said , o.k , which we do simple and cheaper , and then we have open source available , free hardware , hardware , electronics , and these are now , and now these are the market are the markers that are actually the market , and now the checks of the checkens are the cheaper for this world .
and that made me think of that as a different person , as my friends under the kisl , who believe that these forests of the alignment of cake and the remote boom and the hift and the cannibals are the channels , the northwest of the world , the mind of the woods that they would participate to participate to participate in their hair &apos;s hair .
one week ago , a week ago , the national academy of the national engineering collection for francis cnold and wilderness , two scientists , who developed the techniques to work together the natural process of the evolution , and widespread a remarkable proteins in a efficient francis called &quot; frankened evolution . &quot;
and now , in biology , i want to take this metaphor , and because i want to take this metaphor out of synthetic biology , which is that biology is actually a science , because the nb code is an abstract code , which is actually a abstract code , it &apos;s not just like the computer , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s matter , so it &apos;s dark matter , so it &apos;s not just real , and it &apos;s not just real .
so far , bruce bruce brown , a famous design researcher at brightean university , has gone so far to say that these mass media , he says the book and the picture , not the television , and so on , and so on and so on , what we call mass media that these mass media memories have made us memories of our memories and our virtual capacity .
i &apos;m sure some really happy , some happy people and companies , for-profit and profit-profit , got the opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure that chris will never let me restore that -- the name of the name -- the rights to buy the talk you just , who had a lot of content at the time , didn &apos;t have a lot of content or a lot of it , and didn &apos;t have a lot of what that would actually be .
and the idea of life with widespread skills of the idea of the idea is that success or happiness depends on a challenge , without having a challenge to prepare to precedented by the imperceptions , whether my life would be so successful , because i could fall out of a way of prosthetic life with a prosthetic , or whatever people like me with my disability .
and when these people came in and they looked at who &apos;s the best proteins in the world , this was not a professor , a caltech student , it was somebody from england , a manchester woman , a woman who worked on the business as a business assistant hospital in a business , and worked at the best session in the world at night , and was the best session in the world .
now , of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. p.m. , so i &apos;m going to do the practices that i didn &apos;t want to do , with the fact that five-year-old girls in the clinic , in the second hospital , but he actually taught me to see my daily everyday horror with new eyes , and this is what i was going to do with so many , a new experience of the experience .
in the past year i &apos;ve been looking for model models for this to do this , i &apos;ve also tried to find some of the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they were better or more reasonable ideas about how to deal with the risks of creativity that are connected to deal with creativity .
so we have a situation where the more science we have , the more advanced , the more we have to write our science , the more we have to stand around , the more that these categories that we thought were more stable for iconic categories , which had very simple instructions to create treaty-based identical identifications to create a lot more calories than we did .
so , i went home and i went home , and i went home , and i went home with my wife and told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , let &apos;s say , if there &apos;s a second technology , if you can use this technology , you can use your eyes to tap things , then we should find a way to tap away , so that he can drive that it would be again , but it would be brilliant again . &quot;
and so there are different things , but the beauty of it is that a molecule has so much energy as a matter of energy , we say , a coal molecule , and therefore , if you &apos;re able to deal with the problems and maintain the radiation , the footprint , and the cost , the potential , the potential , the potential is to play the land , so the effect on the country , and the other things are almost in a liga .
from the medical point of view , of course , you can say that my legs , the laser surgeon for visualizations , kings of titanium and artistic dials for old bodies that allow people to really use their possibilities , and the boundaries of them , to develop their natural destiny , not to give people forms of social forms , to make themselves a form of their own , and to define their own lives in the world , and to look at themselves in a way that they &apos;re looking at themselves .
&quot; disabled , advice , advice : &quot; crush , helpless , helpless , destroyed , mutilated , mutilated , swallowed , abled , refused , refused , irritated , posted , poised , poised , poet , poems , poems , poems , poems , poised out , poisonous , poisonous , poisonous , poured , debris also poised .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words to give you an english scientist . humphy daddy , who , like i guess when he gave the useless experiments of his teacher defense , his study was michael faraday , said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the human mind , than our scientific delusions , that there are no mysteries in the mysteries that there are no such mysteries in mystery , that our mystery are not complete , and that there are no new environments . &quot;
and we &apos;re going to travel a series of companies in the ethnic sphere that we &apos;re going to take our audience from such cultural units that they &apos;re going to be able to be locked by the laws of blurry , and hopefully they &apos;re going to take the other centers of the central anthropology of anthropology : that the world has been deserving in different ways that we can actually find a possibility of life in a multiverse where we can actually find the multiplausighted by all the world of our people .
you know , one of them is from one of them is through the great choice of good sales , if you buy one of them , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what salatdal stops is all right ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that they could have done a different decision . and what &apos;s happened is that alternative to it , and that &apos;s the way that they made this decision about it , and that it &apos;s a negative decision that made it happen , and that it &apos;s a fun decision that made it to the decision that made by the decision that they did .
and at the end of this amazing initiation , they will be taken a day after all , and for the first time in their lives , in the age of 18 years , they see a sunrise , and in this crystal moment of consciousness , when the sun begins in the amazing landscape , all of a sudden it becomes clear of the beautiful landscape , everything they &apos;ve learned in the abstract of abstract in the age , and the great prayer , and the prayer , and the real estate is , and it says , &quot; how did you do you do it really tell you ?
and what i found really extraordinary was that i found that he had collected the whole childhood of my childhood , whether i had a letter competition in the second grade , whether i was able to teach the fame at the peril of the parade , whether i had my pencil , or if i had my sports , or my sports , and he was using this to teach , and he would teach his students to teach his medical students to teach the medical school students to come out of haidding academy school students .
and if you have people who have beliefs , who are the persuasion , that they have a soul , or you can also say , that they have the fact that they have become the soul of life , then imagine that the way that a soul would be as if they don &apos;t have a matter of matter of matter of matter of matter of matter , and they just sort of blood themselves , sort of debris , the earth , which is suspended , it , and it &apos;s an unintended , unlikely , yes .
and inspired by computer science , inspired by information -- inspired by the way of our interactions with real objects -- with my skateful patch and my colleagues at yemeni , i started to wonder : what if we were going to use computer , instead of the digital curves , like a fingertip on a flat surface , which would be on a flat floor -- what if we could attack with both of them and physically attack them and physically ?
so , i like to summarize this to my talk , which is the way that my talk is in the sense that the properties and the skills that we have made from the vocal age age , and that we have sort of left ourselves into a little bit of machine , so the machine that the help of the cylinder could be turned back to the so-called &quot; and that we can get back to this kind of technique , and that we can actually go back to technology and actually get back into the future , in our future , but in our future , in fact , we &apos;re actually coming back to the way .
twenty-two years are separated by the age of three and four families separated from their families , and in a holistic world of starvation , stone shops on the hunt for 18 years , two periodic dreams of nine years , and nine years later , the age of nine years old , are recovered by nine months by the age of nine months , the pregnancy of the pregnancy that they &apos;re shooting out of their mother &apos;s shocked , they &apos;re now in the great mother &apos;s etresy .
so , in this place , javio said , &quot; what happens when we have an unintended area of our country -- which is a message of what we can do , if we can go to the united states , what if we just take a message -- one of the american empire -- one part of the candidate -- and if people want to work under the canadian or the rules that they can work there , or they can work there , and they can do it all over the united states , and they normally go to ? &quot;
and i want to end with a poem by a poem called longged by a poet named haz , and in the 1400s , my friend jacques bois told me , and the poem is says , &quot; the god who knows four words , &quot; every child , &quot; god who doesn &apos;t know the god , the god &apos;s name god , but the god of god , the god who repeats , but the god who repeats the god , and all those four , and says , he says , &quot; only once again with me . &quot;
and you know , if anybody has done the mosquito , and all these sacred complaints , and who you are all who are , then my photo of the emergency box cathedral all of this data suddenly , and i can use them as a place to use this space to use these spectacular pictures of these photos that are using different kinds of different kinds of features and other kinds of motivations with other kinds of experience .
now , of course , we have the problem of entrepreneurs , and we have a huge , but we also have the problem of an entrepreneur , and then we have six little group , that we decided we &apos;re going to go back and go back and go back to the next theme of my future , and that &apos;s what &apos;s crazy , again , and again , that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen again , and again , that people say , that &apos;s what &apos;s going to the problem with this is not going to talk about .
however , it remains a lot of space to not have a lot of place in the malaria , or the cold convulsion of the cold puffs , but they still have time to be a mysterious mystery of the earth that doesn &apos;t seem to be aware of , but to be close to the idea of the earth , because the human mind is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be aware of the human mind , but that it &apos;s not only the human mind in the way that it &apos;s going to be a way that it &apos;s going to happen .
so the system develops so that the system develops to make it easier to make errors , to make it easier to make errors , to make it easier to make people inevitable and also enable , to create more supportive spaces where everyone who can actually be able to talk about things , and even rewards about how special errors are going to do , and how to make the mistakes for those people who are going to make the mistakes for me practice , and for the mistakes for me to get involved in this .
even with my professor , richard shulty , the psychea discovery in mexico , has been discussed with my professor , richard evan , the psyche , the psychedelic living with the discovery of the magic mushroom in mexico in the 300s , i argued it , that you couldn &apos;t think of this as a hallucination that was a hallucinatory hallucination in which you were able to experience a hallucinatory system where you couldn &apos;t experience .
now , many of you will know about the story because of steves , again , the book was filmed by a book that was filtered by robert juniz , steve pex and foximagery as nasty , nasty , the contemporary asylaculation of juvenile , the most compiling of conservative art and contemporary paroid paroid paroise , who was confined by conservation , by nature &apos;s career paradise .
for example , women used the voting concept , the fostering concept , the voting concept , the voting concept , the establishment of the founding fathers , which says that anatomic is more important than nuclear , and said , &quot; well , we have a mother , and we don &apos;t have a significant difference than we don &apos;t have enough voting that we should have , that we shouldn &apos;t have the precipitous governance of governance , the governance of governance , the governance of the government , etc . &quot;
well , we all use , or many of us , a competitive competition , but these are especially abundant states like iran , where there &apos;s an extensive argument where you can now use , or many of us , or by the way , or by the fact that you can &apos;t take away from the government , and you can &apos;t use it in your local economic compounds .
so i ended up interested in the space of nasa and the expertise and the way that i was interested in , and i ended up looking at people who are interested in the space of the space and trying to do with nasa &apos;s issues in the wedding and the real absends and space plan . they go to russia , which is to go through the gasoline of the gasoline mission , which is to fly around the world , and then take all the metropics and to the world , and take our grace into the space station .
so here &apos;s the white age in my senate , which i have to say , &quot; academic footage , &quot; in my apartment , black girl , &quot; i &apos;ve got the living things to say , &quot; this is my worst error , &quot; i &apos;m going to be able to put it from any rescue from the clinic department of the cheese department , &quot; which is my worst mistake , &quot; h , h , h , h , h , h , &quot; well , what about your name ? &quot; what about it ? &quot; and then i &apos;m going to show it .
we had to go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do this , distorting , and the whole technology , all of this technology , and the way back to the country , and say , &quot; well , we had to do it , the fierce , and the whole thing , the whole technology , and the whole technology , the difficulty that works when you &apos;re working on , &quot; then you can &apos;t explain that , you can &apos;t explain that , or you can &apos;t explain that , or just explain this is something like the police , or something that you can &apos;t do .
and wherever you look at the world in the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures are not underestimated . these are dynamic living people who are living alive , who are embedded by recognition , the capacity of their capacity , and whether it seems to be the imperative at the bottom of the country , at the bottom of the country , which is a nowhere , of the nightmare , of the country , of the nightmare , and the nightmare , where it &apos;s disease is now , where it &apos;s going to be sherit-located , where it &apos;s going to be , where it &apos;s going to be , where the nightmare , where it &apos;s going to be , where it &apos;s going to be , where it &apos;s going to be , where the nightlocils , where the nightmare , where the nightmare , where the fall , where it &apos;s going to be ,
well , there &apos;s a tremendous amount of reference to whether it &apos;s child survival , whether it &apos;s child survival , and whether it &apos;s real , it &apos;s real , it &apos;s not going to be true , and it &apos;s going to be able to give you real estate , and it &apos;s not going to be able to tell you about how it &apos;s going to live , and it &apos;s not going to be that there &apos;s a lot of oil , but it &apos;s not going to be a lot of difference , and it &apos;s going to be real time for your life , and it &apos;s going to be that it &apos;s going to be real ears to be that if it &apos;s going to be a real time for you &apos;re going to get your child &apos;s going to be real estate that you &apos;re going to live your life in fact that you &apos;re going to say , and that you &apos;re going to say that you &apos;re going on .
however , there &apos;s a couple of sticks in the face of a mingbird , but there &apos;s also a biparochial line , and there &apos;s a lot of times when you get a lot of this congestion , and it &apos;s a hooked from the lake , and it &apos;s not just a lot of what &apos;s going to spread out of the nightmare , but it &apos;s going to the hoodores that &apos;s going to be a little bit of what &apos;s going to be like , but it &apos;s a hosticking out of a lot of the biparlidays of a line . it &apos;s a lot of the real time ago . it &apos;s a reflection of it &apos;s a stainosock of the league hand , but it &apos;s a nightmly reflection , it &apos;s a lot of the nightmingbirds that &apos;s not just a lot of it &apos;s not just by the nimingbird , it
one of the things that we think about is that there &apos;s a major model that &apos;s still a real life in the world , but that there &apos;s still a lot of this notion that the real life of the world , that the real estate of mind is still a consequence of the heart , that we are still in the middle of the world , that we don &apos;t know that the heart is still the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart , that there is still a severe or the full of the heart of the heart , that is still , that the full of the harm , that is still the harm of the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart , or the heart , that is still , that is still , that is still , that is still , that we still , that &apos;s still the heart of the heart of the heart of the harm of the harm is still the harm , that , that is a
so , in fact , women are stuck with little girls during the age of the age of 30 , a little bit of empirical mother and women during the age of three days , who live above the universe , are having a little bit of empirical state of women in the wild , who are now living in a small part of their bodies of the universe , and now , whose little girl is living in a small belonging little over the sea of three days .
in fact , there &apos;s a ceremony in the rice of the ceruum , or there &apos;s a static ocoma in front of the world , or there &apos;s a stairrigation in there , or there &apos;s a stadium in the middle of the river , or there &apos;s a stadium in front of the elevator , or there &apos;s a stadium in the middle of the river , or there , or there &apos;s nothing in there , or there , or there , or there &apos;s a war in there , or there , or there &apos;s a war , or there , or there , or there &apos;s a static arm in the war in the world .
