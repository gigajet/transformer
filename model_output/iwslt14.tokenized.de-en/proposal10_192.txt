thank you .
thank you .
from seattle ...
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s what singing .
but it goes .
don &apos;t invent .
yeah , hello .
we love innovation .
solar technology is ...
that &apos;s not ...
we were poor .
are they all ?
i am tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
after a week .
great trick ?
we were .
a few less .
and he says ...
we know that .
ta-dah !
wait twice .
here it is .
that goes fast .
you need time .
music as a language .
that &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... not yet .
thank you .
what a fish .
there &apos;s nothing going on at all .
that &apos;s efficient .
wonderful , you know ?
totally inefficient .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much .
bern .
the only chance .
no hospital .
thank you very much .
stephen watts .
three out .
that was incredible .
thank you . thank you !
yeah , sort of .
it &apos;s horrible .
long , yeah .
fantastic , right ?
the sun goes up .
oh my god .
we love conversation .
we pick up .
after home ? where ?
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we lose them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
a whole lot .
sounds good ?
the whole environmental debate .
sounds familiar , what ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
that &apos;s great .
that was fascinating .
can i be honest ?
the farm is incredible .
what did they do ?
robert gupta .
that &apos;s the system .
that &apos;s all right .
yeah , good afternoon .
lento , slowly .
all i am interested in .
we can do that .
what do you say ?
not sustainable .
yeah , milliseconds .
this is our present .
they have similar principles .
yeah , good afternoon .
good work ! yeah !
just do your job .
this was the result .
thank you very much .
and she did .
so they meet .
it &apos;s essential .
they &apos;re all important .
very different term .
this is an amazing thing .
i am .
it &apos;s helpful .
yeah , that goes .
flying cats .
this is the last .
can we change it ?
these days are over .
these people deserve money .
what happened here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
give them back .
and that &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know .
centers were built .
what happened here ?
but you know what ?
what was the result ?
i was amazed .
it &apos;s generic .
so they knew everything .
you could see manhattan .
here &apos;s the video .
it has sensors .
why not live longer ?
he opens the door .
a couple more .
that &apos;s very good .
oh , so .
there &apos;s no normal .
yeah , i know .
pretty good , not ?
but you know what ?
i have a question .
okay . thank you .
i stood in for him .
players don &apos;t sit around .
so you can do that .
they &apos;re bad . &quot;
so let &apos;s see .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
what do these people need ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i thought about it .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
they use their hands .
so how does this work ?
how interested they are .
that would have been okay .
what are media today ?
they can go in .
so where do we go ?
so it &apos;s true .
how do we know ?
because you know what ?
it &apos;s not a country .
why do we do that ?
not very often .
bg : thank you .
that &apos;s a wish .
and i was an artist .
let &apos;s call him .
not school management .
and that has to come back .
we can do it differently .
they even hurt .
and i understand that .
a tremendous challenge .
there &apos;s no food .
it &apos;s against justice .
but the wrong thing .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
i &apos;m a writer .
here &apos;s another example .
i dedicated children .
it feels great .
i swear it .
i wonder .
he &apos;s not going to do that .
thank you for listening .
why should we do that ?
thank you .
here &apos;s an example .
you see it immediately .
not toxic .
but i kept working .
or before bombs .
i &apos;ll go in here .
there are two possibilities .
we need energy miracles .
why does this happen at all ?
oh . a moment .
let me tell you .
what do you want to do ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s happening to us today .
and i continued .
so she was back .
and so it was .
yeah , here it is .
i agree with them completely .
and why is that ?
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what would all be done ?
i mean the soul .
you compare the same thing .
in china , it was different .
luckily , isn &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s not a protection .
finance pee is a chance .
does anybody see something ?
and i always had it .
very expensive mobilization .
people were playing crazy .
what is the illusion ?
my feeling is again .
just after a journey there .
first of all , limits .
i created one .
yeah . well . good .
think about the camera .
jk : both .
but it gets worse .
here it is .
thank you very much .
be mentor .
maybe 10 times as many .
but it didn &apos;t .
the data came in .
that &apos;s a great question .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
it &apos;s got billions of those .
did you see these guys ?
but there &apos;s something else .
here &apos;s another example .
is it photography at all ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
ohhh .
and then it became international .
there was remixing .
let me summarize .
okay , a few more .
the answer is no .
just on . a lot of fun .
my name is amit .
he had experience .
it keeps you fresh .
that &apos;s a great question .
is that your opinion ?
a almost identical structure .
and it &apos;s getting better .
that &apos;s what she was doing .
it really enjoyed him .
here you see the city .
good afternoon , all together .
am i going to like color ?
ooh , thank you .
some have come and gone .
i think it &apos;s not true .
dk : 60,000 .
there &apos;s an old study .
don &apos;t be badly .
the game is from 2007 .
this is not true for emotions .
he &apos;s called paul open .
what do you think happened ?
who &apos;s going to make it safe ?
first , we have the population .
i don &apos;t like that question .
but what are your fish eating ?
let &apos;s also call him .
this is bills .
the work of interpreting .
but where are we useful ?
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
how do we actually work ?
... his own story .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
so what does that mean ?
now , what does that mean ?
privacy has to be given .
there are online criminals .
we have three main groups .
it was still fish .
he always showed up here .
and then it happened again .
i felt really good .
and many people forget this .
crisis . death . disaster .
it would be intractable .
it &apos;s not our fight .
it &apos;s not our problem .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
why not think about this ?
we love technology and creativity .
it would be knowledge .
we are constantly pushing each other .
and this opens a map .
but what do we do with it ?
it &apos;s something like this .
what do i look at ?
his name is tempt .
will it have my size ?
that sounds crazy , right ?
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
we need to spread the message .
that &apos;s what most people know .
you also have to understand that .
this is what you see down there .
i want to ask you something .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was destroyed on the ground .
they look like this .
is it about the light ?
i grew up in india .
that &apos;s the shortcut .
you see the water coming .
i had a good life .
so what happened years after ?
who are these related ?
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
these changes are in the process .
how about fitness ?
this is the exciting end .
but the key thing is , ...
he &apos;s working well .
and then they set up .
what &apos;s going on there ?
the orange tractor .
they really loved it .
but i felt bad .
they called me to the two .
woman : translation technology .
very scary .
what is the soul ?
we don &apos;t produce more ourselves .
i can claim everything .
he went up and down .
what else can we do ?
this is what the graph looked like .
so i &apos;ll come to the end .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
it may sound bad .
we were 20 people .
that &apos;s how many of us are .
you can &apos;t have bones .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
or is it possible ?
conflicts from conflicts of creativity .
so what do we need to do ?
they didn &apos;t have books .
this is felix .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
thank you for your attention .
that was the beginning of the journey .
i &apos;m honored .
and then everyone went down .
they saw the great impact .
first extension , second .
well , i was the next one .
let &apos;s face it , who &apos;s normal ?
and finally , epic meaning .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
the same thing , just larger .
who is most successful ?
they want to feed the world ?
i wanted to support them .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
i only loved two .
one place is south korea .
again , you &apos;ve got it again .
this is such a natural thing .
my wife told me .
and how did that feel ?
that &apos;s what you can train .
does it make curiosity ?
so it &apos;s inside .
so what now hacking ?
this is what christmas happened .
what &apos;s the thing for a thing ?
so about , you know .
they could have done better .
the answer is yes .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
and that &apos;s not yet anything .
is that reasonable ?
so that &apos;s the good news .
it was a huge success .
so they saw something magical .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
five to one , great .
&quot; of course , i said .
but there &apos;s no problem at all .
they &apos;re always saying , why ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
it was just not invented .
sample should work .
does anybody know what this is ?
for example , this perception in context .
this is a game for outside .
this is god , you know ?
but it was very sad .
so let me remind you .
the answer is no .
and here &apos;s the x .
sometimes i get too much .
but they &apos;re doing the job .
they connected these two people .
her mother moved her alone .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
think about your own decisions .
this picture is from this place .
i see this plumbing sign .
and it took 18 months .
tell me about this world .
this is very risky .
and it worked very well .
again , he showed him four .
i learned everything .
and there are hundreds of them .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there &apos;s good news .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
that really made me sad .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
but that &apos;s not how fast it goes .
how can we help you ? &quot;
sometimes the illusion is illusion .
no was never an opportunity .
the story is not over .
what happened that day ?
well , then we want to .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
so they feel good . &quot;
they come from the artists .
i should not say that .
the power plant can explode .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
she did it for three years .
you can have these cloud .
the data was not available before .
play is not silly .
well , how did that happen ?
is it all just education ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
so , we can .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
everyone talks about happiness today .
don &apos;t taste very well .
play doesn &apos;t mean only car games .
and that was 19 years ago .
which one would you like to do most ?
they create a epic story .
they have so much uncertainty .
the data goes all the time .
nobody ever said that before .
so paul is a terrorist .
and this is what he actually says .
don &apos;t take anything like that .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what should we look like ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
i almost never do it .
she was back and dying .
and of course , it &apos;s incredible .
and here &apos;s the representation again .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
an autistic student .
if at the moment , it &apos;s waste .
so not like detox .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re taking .
we depend on two countries .
everybody needs a goldfish glass .
let me be it . &quot;
people were still happy .
it was my first sunset .
actually , he collected fish .
my name is brian goldman .
they share their experiences with others .
the white lines are there for population .
that &apos;s why i did the movie .
he showed up the algae .
that &apos;s just not technological .
there are four and a half thousand people .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
everybody waste is nutrients .
and that &apos;s how many of us are .
so the question is : how ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and it was an incredible experience .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
but there are two problems in it .
i started feeling better .
but , you know what ?
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
that was grandios .
i talk a lot about these questions .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
we &apos;re in a field .
and then we did that .
basically , they do the same thing .
this is now one of the images .
what other brands are doing ?
and then something funny happened .
they can play with different kinds of play .
the whole building was made of water .
items . yeah .
the morning , before the game .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
the creativity had to kind of get out .
nowadays , everything is easy to have .
asked the nurse .
i should probably not do that .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
and it starts with a doctor .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
we use the energy of the sun .
these are all metadata .
because i can claim everything .
it will always resemble them .
slowly but it took place .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work , right ?
what are you trying to do ? &quot;
we &apos;re not going to go .
what lessons do we learn ?
and the shape plays a role .
you can &apos;t store energy .
then i can transmit it all .
okay , that really makes courage .
once we started a vital .
my second mistake was worse .
and they &apos;re going to have a 257 .
we all love baseball , right ?
somehow , kids don &apos;t do it anymore .
that &apos;s about five meters long .
they &apos;re going to be free in the computer .
because does anyone have a massage ?
and then reconstruct it .
underneath other things should not suffer .
this one has the greatest effect .
the movement of writing it .
anyway , not to navigate .
and that &apos;s all right in the beginning .
the truth is more like this .
do you want to delete jeans ?
you can &apos;t do something like that .
and his answer was yes .
her family gathered up .
thank you very much for your patience .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
what else is risky ?
just be who you are .
i remember my first fire .
what is a story called ?
it &apos;s dark . dark .
i tried something really exciting .
but , really , effective , right ?
but we need that overall .
nuglemissions , yeah ?
this is completely belonging .
let &apos;s move the quiet .
hmmm , my brand ?
that &apos;s frightening .
that sounds scary .
next : nuclear energy .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
i really wanted to make normal happen then .
now i &apos;m going to show you this .
once the judge saw me .
we can &apos;t just do that .
so i went to the courts .
i got a bit scared of technology .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
and there are several reasons for this .
they sell certificates .
it &apos;s not going to document .
why did i go to medicine ?
it can know where we are .
it spreads out .
all adults were aware of the risks .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i like things that are different .
i went to prison -- difficult .
this didn &apos;t make any sense in my eyes .
this is a car game , right ?
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
and this video is in real time .
the game starts from -- silence .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
what about longevity ?
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
so the correlation is low .
so , look what happens .
it really changed the dynamic .
so i just started playing .
and then we said , okay .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
i shoot something through your head .
have you ever been exuberant ?
that &apos;s how we learn it .
because for me , it &apos;s memory .
how and what did he feel ?
we say in germany .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
music is medicine . music changes us .
it turns out it &apos;s really difficult .
and do you know what i learned ?
these are going to be uncontradicted .
but what &apos;s going to happen in the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
this has nothing to do with science .
and that can make a big difference .
but there &apos;s another reason .
anyway , we need a solution .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
so i hear , thank you very much .
they escape the channels .
maybe two percent .
we started this 15 years ago .
how far do you get there ?
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
do you know what &apos;s neither ?
so the first step to a interpretation .
and it &apos;s still not interpretation .
that must be the difference .
if you come on , yeah ?
you can show me , i was there .
this is just the minimum .
we can regain our nutrients .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
on the book and on the picture .
this image reminded me of something .
i find them off .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but maybe this isn &apos;t the case .
and what does that mean for designers ?
i want to prove that to you .
it was a pretty fate project .
here he makes the sun go up .
this is the memory .
this rivers take away from the rivers .
a has these benefits and risks .
our magazines are read by millions .
lego made it possible for everyone .
privacy is not about debate .
they had been geneticized .
i &apos;m the redefined physician .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
baseball is filled with great statistics .
because we live on a water planet .
do we really want to go to this direction ?
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
and these are the neural structures .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
oh , my time is over ?
something increases in me .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
so we measured his movement .
this is a picture of the object .
apparently it was quite popular .
you see something fun here .
i really like beautiful clothing .
he can only use his eyes yet .
but the truth is far away .
you can do it all the time .
so this crazy story could be true .
who would ever wish to wish ?
it would have been too easy to do .
her father died shortly after her birth .
for a year we didn &apos;t have a cents .
we need to increase complexity .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
here &apos;s her brand melting .
it &apos;s supposed to experience the experience .
but then they really want to get deep inside .
you want to orient in the museum ?
that was more for emphasizing .
okay , you really want to know ?
and i had to go out of town .
we won a few prices .
who does not want to change healthier children ?
it makes excellent to kids .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
no , i mean it really seriously .
i hold the knife in my hand .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;ll take my sleeve back .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
now i see greg moon .
a billion people are hungry today .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
i love this fish .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and this sounds quite different from before .
he &apos;s been there about sixth .
i started an institutional institute .
they even get funding for funding .
the movie was not yet provided .
we need to think about what marks .
what do you do with it ? &quot;
i call that the radiation .
we &apos;ve been playing for 1994 .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
this is ideology , not science .
and that brought me through that way .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
very simple , so it &apos;s going to come .
it &apos;s busy .
the hot projection today .
automatically , it runs to the right thoughts .
that &apos;s how natural things happen .
but it requires a lot of planning .
we can reinvent it all the time .
in how we think of north .
and it depends on phosphorus .
often in the third place , again .
it &apos;s longer than these other networks .
the rocks are color .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
it &apos;s about changing levels .
i started with my usual talk .
this is a very sensitive question .
i learned that from my grandmother .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
we didn &apos;t write those app .
and every morning i jumped .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
that &apos;s a very good job .
how about words would you describe that ?
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
there are also world record .
to ask , what is the right one ?
people are talking about the urine .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
the living ones are the spirits .
they gave their blood pressure up .
thank you , but the best part is still coming .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of equilibrium .
happy productivity . fantastic !
the result of that was catastrophe .
and everyone in this room needs to be in .
here &apos;s the olive oil .
bjoun sundin .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
we &apos;ve been running a lot of procedures .
this may be a public exposure .
my brother stared at me .
these are the apple saras .
i talked a lot about magic .
who could have this looked at everything ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who do you actually want to inform ?
completely on a particular goal .
what do you think is going to happen next ?
they have it . they always have it .
so this is a hard one .
it &apos;s so far constant .
they literally put the lever around .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
most importantly , when he died .
so it &apos;s going to create two circles .
the byproduct is clean water .
this sounds vital once again .
we built unique elements here .
you always lose rare animals .
she &apos;s going to touch her deep .
he died , broken through the story .
here you see how the building works .
they went through each other .
tell me what you &apos;re feeling .
the other one had a strong decline .
let &apos;s make a little picture .
here you have this little mechanism .
there he melted .
the interest to make r &amp; amp ; d .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
students are divided into notes .
these things are logical .
and here you feel it .
for energy for me , this is a guy .
i tried to understand them .
all of these generations need only a few milliseconds .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to escape .
that i had written these crazy things .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
this is just a little bit less destruction .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
this is also a paradigm shift .
a dalmatiness , exactly .
you &apos;ll see first of the back in front of you .
so , from modern in the computer society .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
we have to get far , and that &apos;s how fast it is .
it &apos;s about a novelty of america .
they &apos;re all embarrassing questions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they are the home countries of somebody .
we &apos;re walking through international rituals .
now look at this curve .
widrilling skills simply belong to our lives .
i trebled people in death cells .
they were inspired to be inspired .
leadership might have some mutations .
so scott gets that anchor .
we worked late late into the night .
so i followed my gut feeling .
he moved back to the silence .
now we saw the reverse effect .
polite ones have all kinds of applause .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
you brought your images with me , yeah ?
so ... so , not so optimistic .
he switches the engines .
let &apos;s start with the truth .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
they had a concept of blue blood .
i believed everyone could do that .
i never met him personally .
even cats look at this video .
there was jimmy kimmigrant .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
how would you describe your brand ?
we &apos;re talking about cows , fresh .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
no , that was what i thought .
i &apos;m a redundancy person .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
this is a painting of a circle .
the roof was covered with water as well .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
and women argued that successfully .
we can support them , be good .
look at what it does .
the main man grabbed me .
sexual progression is coming into the picture .
i read them the entry .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
that &apos;s the truth . i believe it .
we &apos;re talking about appointment .
it was really incredibly profound .
he shaped his head , no .
this is going to take place in the next april .
we also got very accurate data .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but with the right design , please .
we can support them , be good .
alone , what is information ?
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
there was never a time before .
and even lomg thinks about it .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
and also , these sources of undercover .
how will you feed the world ? &quot;
this is an ecological network .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
i am an expert on relationships . &quot;
the chef had checked him .
you &apos;re doing this kind of box .
this is such a traded part .
that &apos;s what &apos;s just been represented .
what takes five million-million-dollar seconds ?
i see the dalmatiner .
it might take it to take it .
maybe you need to think about it again .
no , no , lacking .
and this picture was recorded by atlas .
156 nations send our tv channel .
they tap into their internet connection .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
it was not yet unrejected .
i am a human . i make mistakes .
this is the system that we live in .
but i kept asking myself this question .
and that was what i felt .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
you should also wish to yourself .
something very strange happens here .
and that was the outbreak of the outbreak .
i learned some very simple things .
it can know how to keep it .
so it creates a feedback .
boston has not only a welfare center .
this is a humble little app .
the ujafer comes from another place .
&quot; they didn &apos;t get rid of them . &quot;
i lived in parallel worlds .
somebody made an old-fashioned version .
and i want to read you the precaution .
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
they can be logical and intuitive .
tell me a little bit about this part .
make it possible -- all of you here .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
does anybody know what that is ?
so this is the reason for this project .
it &apos;s called &quot; i jumped with . &quot;
let me tell you a little bit about this .
we don &apos;t exist in this way .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
we can make ourselves something like this .
so the first excitement .
and there &apos;s some sort of open employees .
daniel kahneman : safe .
everybody would like to make people happier .
the domain also plays a role .
and why ? genetic transformative food .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
we now have masses in this country .
not even the truth will be free .
because now you can apply a sentence .
you see the timeline .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
but it &apos;s not just the words .
thank you , danny kahneman .
we &apos;re going to get absolutely flat line .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
because we don &apos;t want to shoot any genes around ?
we don &apos;t want businesses to own .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t do that much .
they lead the process , they understand it .
there &apos;s a lot of stuff that needs to come together .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
bad ? i was completely confused .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and then he can walk away .
a beautiful story , i mean .
his personal appearance of the eroses .
i &apos;m going to try and do that by an example .
he &apos;s got to work first as a present .
but we begin to see a change .
this is an annual water river .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
it &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
so litta open source is open source .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
they grow five centimeters .
maybe i did it with good reason .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
let &apos;s take something else out now .
it &apos;s all coming out of our own pockets .
normal people are not accessible . &quot;
as an artist , i am very important .
here you see roberto dance .
and anyway , italy won the end .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
but the game is a format .
thank you . i have a question to you .
he had his 20 minutes of great music .
well , then i &apos;m going to show you .
this is just an insurance method .
it should contain the two elements again .
shaking the environment , make less trash .
but i &apos;ll talk about it again .
yeah . she doesn &apos;t do anything else .
the goal of the entire film is transparency .
a language is the expression of the human mind .
it was an accent .
what they need is a new medical culture .
alone , accessible and without support .
do you want to get there and listen ? &quot;
i think our identity is threatened .
many of my mandarin are very young .
my cousins went all over the place .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
here are two different jewels .
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i have him on my laptop . &quot;
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist .
a whole acoustic whip .
the difference will be perceived as a loss .
in two hours , it builds up everywhere .
the emergency room has all the strands .
no insurance can self-assemble .
there &apos;s a lot of great books to this topic .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputer .
this country is different from 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of slave family .
you can predict why . why is that ?
what kind of application i do ?
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
isn &apos;t half a quarter or a quarter ? &quot;
so what can we get out of all this ?
so virtually a translation of translation .
no tree is carbon neutral .
and on , now you see it all the time .
so the next step was happening in this communities .
he had uploaded a lot of natural videos .
by the way , this is just the workforce .
two minutes later , three things happened .
thank you very much . that was incredible .
so , he &apos;s in there . exactly .
that really triggers the fuel problem .
and ecologically it was a disaster .
this is one , part of her .
it just didn &apos;t come in , you know ?
in other areas -- the world of communication .
this is my supermarket . no big deal .
but western governments also help themselves .
sleep deprivation is ubiquitous .
i &apos;m going to be tired of all of us .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
if you burn coal , no .
say , there &apos;s no prediction .
can you play it in blue now ?
no , we &apos;re stuck with what &apos;s inside .
and there &apos;s a central point in there .
you know , everybody &apos;s eaten .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
what are actually archaic models now ?
and the list can be used endless .
so , that was my primary motivation .
preventing america . find out more .
and the problem is not technology .
it &apos;s the average performance of the vector .
we wondered , and nobody knew it .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s sort of sucked us up .
and then it looks like this .
do you remember the needle again ?
so , help me a little bit .
imagine mozart kind of efficient .
i &apos;m happy i &apos;m there .
the water volatiles have expanded .
they make it worse for us .
man 3 : i am the museum guy .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a lip pen .
in between , the instruments have evolved .
i want to just explain this a little bit .
in fact , no viral video wanted to do .
in this three-sentence , three sentences come in .
three sentence , you still know from school .
you can zoom in very easily and zoom in .
now i &apos;m going to add a bass .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
if not , jellyfish are someone else today .
this is the machine below the geneva .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
they laughed more than you do it here .
your problem is that they have too little .
third : escalation of expectation .
the official dogma of what ?
they just hear about and then start talking .
let me show you how they work .
it &apos;s a game called following .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
we think of energy nowadays .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
you walk around and you get yourself .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
think of an airplane as well .
that is something that is built in the city .
second time . end of the normal game time .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
just imagine that for a moment .
raise your hands . let me see .
maybe we can see vibrating change as change .
remember , it &apos;s not much better .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
and let them start with an example .
you know , science is not a company .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so , that really resembled me .
i tried to preserve the body .
life had not changed for centuries .
but that &apos;s how many people got over the years .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
my fourth technology : predictable for complexity .
the third technology : category .
it captures a thousand square kilometers .
you get up on two -- very simple .
you want to tell me something about my brand .
it was something that we knew .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
thursday : confidence is the key .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
i wanted to restore the health of a disease .
now , if you think a little bit further .
what ? that really left me out .
we reject geneously changed food .
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
we &apos;ve forced them to do them . puff .
my parents are 80 on the ferry .
and there &apos;s the laughing problem .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
we &apos;re talking about drowning information .
you can jump directly to a specific copy .
you can dive into a particular year .
because this is what &apos;s going on with it , right ?
shaking the environment , less energy .
this is called the osit-model model .
now you see the dalmatiner .
and the last two is also here today .
yeah , i was afraid of all these things .
this has to be at the bottom , zero .
i didn &apos;t let myself be discouraged .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
amazingly , he still was delicious .
and over time , you can react to others .
our goal was simply to say , okay .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to keep going .
everything is composer of that .
it &apos;s all that &apos;s in there , it &apos;s useful .
this is balanced in china in a second .
phosphorus problem is much more critical .
anyway , that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing in there .
the permanent ice is marked with red .
and if not , dance still dance .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
seriously -- the gang lifting !
well , this cartoon makes some people say .
here &apos;s some on the hampton .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
i thought i could integrate myself .
we still think they &apos;re originally originally .
the three words said , do you remember ?
i remember it yesterday .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
well , i went to the courts .
i said , &quot; okay , grandmother . &quot;
we are in the middle of this transition .
i work in the solar technology industry .
and let me show you a simple example .
but it has an unexpected twist .
so that made sense , it fit together .
but we seem to be quite happy with it .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
scott was talking about man .
and here &apos;s each piece of very good .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of the various images .
is it the detail or the colors ?
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
no one has to green ideas .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
i think i may have heard more hands .
this would be somebody who is completely intuitive .
eeee ! no , thank you .
and this is a million-dollar concert .
so at this point , we need digital security systems .
so again , the fit really well together .
the internet and its service is a miracle .
intersexuality is coming in many different forms .
so they go out ; they save the shoes .
that &apos;s about one percent of the total population .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
what we want to do is create the future .
i &apos;m going to live in the real life of this feedback .
there &apos;s a lot of happy coaching .
let me show you what i &apos;m close to .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
damages mend . damaged .
we &apos;ve gotten rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
they were just like the people in this room .
my grandparents urged this number to 70 .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
we need to use more research on this .
there &apos;s every footprint there .
i usually would take the needle out .
there is somebody sitting there who had no childhood .
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
let &apos;s do this as if we had a machine .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
this is going to be a key element of this believer .
they live with the help of chemosynthesis .
i was totally enthusiastic , you know .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
and every evening , they fly 40 kilometers back .
they fly 40 miles to the farm every morning .
what &apos;s the forage ? &quot;
natural light then offers smartphone .
that &apos;s not what anybody has done in the world .
picasso replies , wait .
we always create new tensions and conflicts .
that the subject of ecology is a global thing .
now i &apos;m going to do something more headlines .
they &apos;re all back on their way back .
and they had to remove what we did .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
let &apos;s just have signed down .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
that &apos;s how they can &apos;t get them wrong .
what do you do with certificate ?
this is alfred gonzalez .
there can be a sequence of changes .
and this is very important in medical research .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
what would you say to someone who believes this ?
then he whispered me into the ear .
the rest of the time they &apos;re delayed .
i &apos;ll start playing with a couple of simple examples .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
the question is why people accept that .
and i got back to work .
it &apos;s linked to oxygen and silicon .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
then i wonder : how could that happen ?
first of all , i thought that would be a game .
the storyteller always needs more senses .
and try this all again with another generation .
today , a lot of people have given up the government .
next week , this is coming to the market .
she &apos;s got a button , an hour .
well , it was friday , it was true .
thank you very much for behavioral economics .
i mean , no one ever saw a particle .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
the first one is a classic , apple .
it &apos;s the way i want to be .
these things have a positive effect .
no one wanted to have something to do with the film .
what do you think the answer will be ?
on the left side , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s why i think we need to be leadership .
so we have this terrible idea .
so two pairs , every single baby .
ladies and gentlemen , their relative relations .
it &apos;s the test of survival and success .
the teacher didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
the best part is -- in one second .
so each concert is a different concert .
so not saving , forbidden , avoid .
and everything is packaging or content .
i could park in front of my house . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
they &apos;re supporting others from their mistakes .
i put them , and i went to the treatment .
do you know how to call a 4,000-squarter ?
notice two things at this curve .
and i have to say , there was power to me .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
with 16 books , i started illustrating books .
that our contribution to the system is to choose .
there had to be another puzzle .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
he hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
i never want to make a difference in life .
so i was talking to a few months later .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- that &apos;s how their fingers are .
i want to show you something like that .
and of course , it did click .
it was summer , and i had an app .
why do we do that ? why do we do it ?
and they &apos;re not only going to die in masses .
what happened is that we could do that .
they don &apos;t invest time in power .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . i put it on .
these sentences are absolutely correct and correct .
anyway , that &apos;s what i want to do .
technical circles are just the same .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for nine .
i put him up here in particular .
in the beginning , the tribal society is the language .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
so you want to get from outside to people .
we don &apos;t create identity ; we invent it .
it was a lot of time , and i &apos;m in iron .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
now everybody &apos;s trying to see a pattern from this pattern .
he came to me and hugged me .
everybody who were so , they began to divide .
but it &apos;s definitely not a optimum situation .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you do it crazy ?
the country on them would roll up .
so smart , a big topic everywhere .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
we want something about the death penalty companies .
there are some interesting developments .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet , there is a realistic level .
so the theme of the day : financial conservation .
in fact , no , it wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
and we need to do a lot of better at this device .
it came out four and a half years ago in italy .
and i &apos;m saying that this is good .
this is a problem that a lot of players have .
i &apos;ve summarized the last three of the five .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
storage those , solves the rest .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
well , what &apos;s the brand ?
i want to help them calm down .
both are survivors , both of them .
as i said , amanda is wearing our election .
there was no canal signs .
have you taken all your vitamins every morning ?
so this was a highly strange experience .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
we &apos;ve got 20 percent in germany .
all over the place , this windmill , almost too .
information is a difference that makes a difference .
the only thing they had was their head .
so for him , they were just clarified .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
this is a dead turtle turtle .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
i have something i want to show you .
how about living in good health ?
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
and i found this incredibly exciting .
they have the flow of water coming in .
so , we can &apos;t make these things at all .
in the countries where people come to money .
and what does it look like in there ?
we understood that the weather is global .
and in this head , the memory was remembered .
you saw it in the news .
this is a completely unsustainable development pattern .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
everyone in my digital neighborhood is gone away .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
there seems to be an imperative .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
think about that . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
now they understood the advantage of prototyping prototyping .
this is the u.s. for hundreds of years .
i think the first place is the curiosity .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
but maybe you can still agree with them .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
not to be composable , of course .
if you &apos;re in love with somebody , efficient ?
and we see that it &apos;s coming through .
because it doesn &apos;t feel real money .
yeah , so what should be biohacking ?
here are some people who test it .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
there are which ones that are much more spatial .
the senior headquarters is right here .
i thought he &apos;d have kidney stones .
and melting to my high school doctor .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
we want the number of crops .
the silence is oconcrete .
the netherlands writing of dna was an interesting step .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
but what happens to action is different .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the label .
no apple ever shoved again .
good night , sweet advice . &quot;
now he &apos;s bringing a tractor into the scene .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and slope .
if your job is dancing , dance .
so we got about 50 of the magnets .
this is footage over a six seconds .
but dutch is not always such a bad thing .
in our own countries , we would never do anything like this .
they &apos;re going to be rare because we &apos;re catching them .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of the benefits of animals .
all of these are unprecedented .
we have access to exponential tools .
i remember it was yesterday .
and i &apos;m going to be a character in the book .
tell me , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
so each trash was slightly different .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
i put my job in 95 pounds .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
we found that it really moves strange .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
the answer is probably going to be &quot; no . &quot;
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
this is something like our camel .
so that they can attract all the movement .
here are the results that we just got .
but how do you do that in practice ?
and it &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
i want to do it by not getting sterile . &quot;
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
that &apos;s the problem that i try to solve .
this is not about how happy a person lives .
and you ask : what happens to those moments ?
... that too , the domain of play is a role .
probably many of you in this room know this trick .
yeah , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix it .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
well , i understand that . i do .
marshmallow needs to be on top .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
today i &apos;m talking about energy and climate .
these blocks won &apos;t give us any money .
i can turn the sequence as it goes off .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
for nathaniel , music means mental health .
that &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
because , in fact , this man is not interested in evidence .
because we can &apos;t live without those likes of life .
he &apos;s just going to deceive them and not itself .
why do i have to afford this little car ?
a phrase with his own breath .
the interpretation is barely spoken in the beginnings .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
and in my youth i said , expectation .
it &apos;s sort of a process of cooperative .
the whole thing is a game i have to say .
or they didn &apos;t have any photo oligraphy .
and all of that leads to a big question .
they &apos;re virtual reality , and they &apos;re completely without computers .
yeah , what do we actually do now ?
and the world in which we lived like this .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
if you generalize it , this is what happens .
and that was not hard to diagnose diagnosis .
i was an obsessive student .
all right , really good , maybe a all-star .
wealth , not debt , is affecting the result .
she had the last word in every family street .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we use this word with such vertebrae .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and that worked . applaud for scott .
i made the decision to move into the u.s .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
and that was an experience in dehumility for me .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
or are you more like a down-down tricereal ?
what is the next one that you want to talk about .
so what are we going to see in the movie ?
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve found that .
and that &apos;s the planning behind it .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
each icberg has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
you see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
it &apos;s natorientation , and it &apos;s just natorientation .
we have the passion of a innocent innovators .
this is moore &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
we want to create mass ingenuity . &quot;
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
now we &apos;re doing that with drill drill and machines .
this is the u.s. center for service and information .
and we want to put this on a global scale .
we all have navigational systems in our cars .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
good , let me show you something more about this .
here we were , and this is the painting .
emc : it &apos;s called transparency .
there was a lot of crazy things going on .
the avian age to the machine age .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same with the disabled movement .
but will we make the best part of our play ?
8,000 players were playing the game for eight weeks .
so we have a total of 1.5 billion players .
you expect an extra billion player in the next decade .
but one of them is much worse than the other .
but do you know what you don &apos;t have a right ?
i thought we &apos;d take the poker same way .
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
and so i came up with something unusual .
so basically my two passions flew in .
you do something that is actually a little bit different .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
i don &apos;t know who of you know this picture .
i &apos;m just going to agree , that &apos;s logical .
i think it seems important to negotiate both .
the question of death penalty is an interesting question .
the kid in me is really excited about this opportunity .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
today , i &apos;m going to report unexpected discoveries .
the underwater part comes from a stone breakdown .
when i say reality , i mean photo reality .
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
and what was that for you ? what did it succeed ?
a little bit more about them , they &apos;re not .
it was &quot; forever , for forever . &quot;
tuesday : adaptation is totally overrated .
the dog ! i was out in front of him .
do you want to become more attractive and self-conscious ?
she didn &apos;t go to the breathing , she was in blue .
people in the side of the room are now coming in .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
you need that , and we don &apos;t give it to you .
and some of it doesn &apos;t work , and some people don &apos;t .
so we run away , and where do we go ?
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
but the phosphorus is not going to be able to replace .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
we wanted to develop a learning tool for language learning .
i may have another 40 years of work in me .
you know what the answer to that question is ?
if you want to make them hyperlinks between the images .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not taken as a big loss .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , small idea .
this is the kind of educational sneakers .
there &apos;s now a whole lot of studies now .
and we &apos;re learning confidence and the rules of play .
probably one of those numbers must get very close to zero .
and i said , &quot; yes , very much . &quot;
you can say things that have influence in the world .
... would you mind going to show the slide .
in the same way , i think we &apos;re playing games today .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the aid doctor .
and i went over and i just stopped .
she also shows up on the other side of the book .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
another favorite image of me , starvation night .
these results were achieved by several weeks of hard work .
this player is just before a episode of episode .
why do i do that ? what comes out ? &quot;
there &apos;s a program that might have been some of you .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
you know , he was in 1835 .
and yet , we still don &apos;t understand the possibilities of it .
my mom suffered from the boat .
these are the people who shape my view of the world .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the border .
we see this in all kinds of fields of human life .
and then it was after the three months .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent cracks .
the main problem here is something like aids .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell you the power of reality .
i have a nice concrete example .
then i say heart suffering , yes ?
and we &apos;re going to invent as often as we want .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
his whole holiday job has changed .
i said , &quot; promises , grandmother . &quot;
it &apos;s forgiveness and strange programs .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
but what this picture says is a problem .
there are some places that we can apply to .
we called it the digital water poison .
because they have specialized skills of processing .
so here are some natural fireflies .
the second factor is the services we use .
it changed my way of making films completely .
it &apos;s hard to overestimate the destruction .
so you could feel like you could sell it .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
that means that ants weigh a lot more than we do .
and we can now look at this .
geeky and queue leonard cohen .
so , go ahead and start to invent them .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
this is an idea worth spreading .
imagine only two other small changes in front of you .
how many would decide to choose a good memory ?
and this is the bee of the message .
so please listen to this , if music is played .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell you what &apos;s true about it .
the first two sentences , which are logical .
actually , we know that something else is the case .
now that should actually be a joke , but it should be .
once you do that , and then you learn the sentence .
we can make these things work on different examples .
what we love about ourselves is the discovery .
they moved to a natural concept .
so these women were meeting , and they just got involved .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so he got the citizens to check it .
and we designed an ipaipad .
the loans and the sponsors were healthized .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzles &apos; puzzles .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you zoomed inside . you can actually walk inside .
you can see in all these museums here .
how much money will it take to realize that ?
think about that . that attack is generic .
and if not , nothing &apos;s going to happen at all .
so we start with a winky drone drone .
he says , &quot; enriching all the proues . &quot;
imagine a soundscape airplane .
it &apos;s a totally denial of error .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .
this is another view of the tree of life .
they shared the kingdom in two .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
there &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
we had no child paralysis in this country yesterday .
and i used it for a while to find out .
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
you have to be ready to take risks like this .
&quot; look at your stocks , pink .
there is no overpopulation growth in trees .
then you &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s given change .
and the third area that actually explains itself .
i &apos;m looking forward to talking to all of you .
every big picture is the beginning of a dinner .
you wouldn &apos;t like starvation , and you know what ?
or are they more like a down-down tricereal ?
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to ask ourselves .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i said , &quot; please fly in the air . &quot;
they can move inside and different kinds of experiences .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
play is the trickster that keeps us away .
if you have something to give it , you &apos;ll give it now .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
they teach them how to open doors .
antarctica : healthy , powerful , performance . &quot;
and here are two patients . these are their records .
i mean , this is a real cognitive fund .
i think that &apos;s true of every human being on the planet .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
so , there &apos;s a climate change going to be terrible for you .
i &apos;ll just show you the new york times website .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
clean coal , they &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
it grows in winter and shrinks in summer .
not only bad , but the worst ever .
everybody knew their genius was a little bit lam .
we repair it , repair it .
and the world in which we now look like this .
but these are all roads in the u.s.a .
we dance in the temple and we become god . &quot;
child mortality has decreased by a tenth .
that &apos;s there , then that comes back .
maniok is something that a half a billion people eat .
she &apos;s not an idea ; she &apos;s a process .
and you know what my answer to all of this is ?
we walk into the arms of placebo industry .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
where &apos;s the biggest interest in what &apos;s really dealing with ?
furthermore , the energy rice is important to you .
we returned to the titanic of titanic .
because artists have an elaborate ratio .
and at all , you work a lot less than i do .
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
i &apos;m never going to play more like this right now .
it &apos;s a form of reform behavior , yeah ?
and less usable or use it is friendly .
how can i make something user-use friendly ?
i don &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
so how do we work when we look in there ?
every society is preferred by a primary medium .
and these interactive portraits are perceiving each other .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation .
you might have heard that we built watermarks .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our lives .
they get a model that comes from all over the earth .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
so in other words , i definitely want something i want .
and i see the same process in combination of photographs .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it was looked at this year almost 200 million times .
they had 348 different kinds of signs .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with that .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
he described one of them as very ordinary .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
on a spot , the screen filled with leaves .
so the occupation movement has done it .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
this year , almost 50 million people looked at it .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
i want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
we should put the bear in the cage .
are they eight feet and monkey like 007 ?
the life self has no voice in this choice .
they are in the united states , in europe and japan .
and in the world , everything gave me a sense to me .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
dane , in a moment of headphones .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
and no , it &apos;s not something like yourself or san francisco .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open doors ?
here &apos;s the latest version of this contract .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
and these were kind of the first of people to play games .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
you never get a task you can &apos;t fix .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen rarely seen flakes .
i take this hand . and here &apos;s the knife .
and the movie is called , &quot; the move . &quot;
well , in this area there are not a couple of thousand goals .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
how would you change your relationships and your negative energy in it ?
well , we introduced the mayor hole .
now , nowadays , we know everything about where our things come from .
france does it . italy does it .
how do you tell people about their characteristic properties ?
now chimpanzees are known for their aggressive vity .
he carries every five-pound hope out of my mind .
is it true for others or is it also affecting us ?
so i say , let &apos;s start out the world changing .
edward ova is a national scientist .
we currently spend three billion hours a week playing with online games .
the biggest difference between them is the transition with time .
we tried to get to the automation .
bg : a energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
and i say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make yourself .
with vopivot , you can dive into a decade .
but for many people , this is a little bit radical .
so i &apos;ve taken a lot of fish in my life .
i understood that this is exactly the nature of art .
in fact , the notes are very vague and unprecisely .
because we don &apos;t do things anymore .
that &apos;s where it &apos;s going to be more like my glasses .
as i said , it just started to do it .
this is an interactive trickster .
and what happens is that , in spite of course , it makes you .
i &apos;m going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and everybody knew it worked like this , right ?
i would rather keep doing this work that i love .
and the question is , are they good news or bad news ?
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
here says , &quot; take your fingers on every light . &quot;
the next step was to find the apps for it .
we still know where all of the gas stations are .
so you &apos;re just going to go to google ate projections .
what else tamorphosis do they go through ?
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money trying to look great .
this constant feedback doesn &apos;t exist in real life .
i &apos;m going to take it for you , and then explain it .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
a research mester in the topic of interface .
i &apos;m also going to resolve what &apos;s in there .
you don &apos;t know anything in this goldfish glass . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great dunes .
in the future , most crime play online .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
now he &apos;s standing on the red list of endangered species .
30 years ago , this would have sound ridiculous .
but i really think that after we got something else .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
the cell communities started to abstract information again .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is great . this is the digital physical .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacine .
&quot; don &apos;t make it feel like it &apos;s untrue .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the steck .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together .
also , urban designers and farmer , are very interested .
there &apos;s not even him online . there &apos;s no streaming .
that doesn &apos;t work for the regret itself .
our steps at the digital age of life were exponentially .
this is starvation night , probably never seen that before .
in the course of this journey , i learned a lot .
as a child , i was drawing comic books and so on .
if we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
right now , this is our goal .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
we were just in albering around like this .
many of you talk about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
i was quite obsessed with studying the deep sea .
so when sounds out , there &apos;s no soul .
this , by the way , is the most difficult part in my talk .
i can &apos;t play as much as in 20 years .
both happened to me , fracking up .
so a lot of testosterone , but no response to it .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my lap .
1m is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the destination ?
that &apos;s why it &apos;s like thinking about weighs .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
now , how do people die in such a hack ?
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and you can see this green point in the middle there .
i sold animals throughout the country , around the world .
this is my meat , and i can turn it around .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know it .
no , this is exactly the right one , yeah ?
many of you are covered in faces .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
in both cases , operated and did well .
she didn &apos;t have a treatable brain damage .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
and the fish also had the fortune to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
it was the misguided cement against drugs .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
there &apos;s more left behind , it &apos;s still deeper .
but we only know a little bit about where things go .
ok , imagine the way we motivate ourselves .
i know what people think when they see it .
ask them questions , demand evidence , demand them .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
everything in life is beautiful is not efficient .
as it used to happen earlier on the village .
this is what the nanotured machine age is happening .
what we have is a political mindset of land in our country .
they put them on the beaton machine .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental disconnect .
she was able to find a temporary learning framework within a time .
... it &apos;s the crowdsourcing .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with them .
i worked in a coal miner -- dangerous .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there he was crunking and he meant , right ?
that means they &apos;re going to get back to the board .
so , like a human with certain things .
and of course , as design is taking influence on the perception .
but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambition .
lawyer : i &apos;m a lawyer .
we have a abstract abstract language .
another example is what we call virtual reality .
but , in fact , it was a better fun day in this night .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
it was called the &quot; automatically headed stone . &quot;
it &apos;s a certificate interface .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
what are they going to consume ? what are they going to do ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it stop ?
they slow down for a big problem .
we see the process which feeds itself .
do advice ? yeah . live ? alive .
here &apos;s a short video of what we &apos;re doing .
but combined , you can create something special like this .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
because the images of the food they recommend .
cry and whales , you &apos;re in the museum .
the idea is to translate a digital security system .
or other models , or even technical capacity .
and this is indeed a conservative estimation .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain him .
we can put this time machine all that we want .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy progress .
this was not a movie , not a hd , that was real .
i wasn &apos;t there a long time ago .
because you know , this is a fun process .
have you seen a cliff tree ?
there &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve described .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
feed america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
frosty , the carbon man becomes clean .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
so i take a step back , and i look at the other way .
i filmed in war -- difficult and dangerous .
so we should be doing better at figuring out what the goal is .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
if we &apos;re going to build cities , this is actually a big thing .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
in other words , play is our adaptation .
can you imagine something that comes from tablet ?
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
you can just call some names and people will understand .
diphy , rocks , child paralysis ...
this is a variation of a thing that was done .
now , the energy source is over time .
and it was an experience that was able to give me hollywood .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of film .
it caused immense juilment in the control room .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s this loyalty , coded flavor .
the shrimp is eating the phytoplankton .
and so he &apos;s flying its agonizing .
and then there &apos;s a whole bunch of simulations .
but it wasn &apos;t that in the years &apos; time .
the musicence is the extension of our bodies .
he only lived three years .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
a baby needs about sixth of dizzy wind .
so i know some of you who haven &apos;t been involved .
that &apos;s a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
in 25 years it &apos;s going to be gone from here .
it &apos;s like asking someone to check the sun .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
this is a idiotic debate . it has to stop .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of things .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
bruno gisani : thank you very much . thank you .
i have a friend who drives a passage .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound pediatrician .
and because we &apos;re going to grow older , the wind gets bigger .
this is the time dream that you love .
and today we &apos;re still very , very strong stories .
and i think technology will always become more important in our modern societies .
and they &apos;re predicting how they read , they &apos;re serious .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
and i didn &apos;t expect it to ever change .
it &apos;s also my big , life-long love and fascination .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
why do they acquire us if we can &apos;t buy us ?
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
a few years ago , i started developing live .
they still describe them as untouched .
my grandfather was in prison during the prohibition .
she was a handful , strong woman , she had effect .
so , in a way , the technique spins us .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
but what if you want to see the paintings ?
but my logical page also didn &apos;t like it .
i just want to say something about salad ression .
blaise , this is really incredible . heart wish .
we also got to design schools .
this is the simulation of the chesapeake bay .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against justice .
my uncle died in alcohol diseases .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
in fact , we &apos;re also a multi-touch community .
what is this new condition that takes the world slowly ?
let &apos;s call it a lot of money .
if one neighbor helps the other , we strengthen our communities .
ohhhhh , wowwwww !
they always worry that they &apos;re losing regalactic .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and my talk today is mainly about this cognitive behavior .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
open the map , and jump with a click .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a lot of transparency right now .
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
you could also use ordinary design -- technology to spread .
one of my friends made it -- richard bollingo .
imagine if those imagery could really start flying .
i like to go and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
these are the kinds of questions we have to face .
i was fascinated by the elegant and beauty of biology .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
and this is from an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
i mean , how much toes do we get from our memories ?
the more money you make is the more money you make .
that all of our survival is linked to every single link .
10 minutes later , the poet announced a pause .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
and yeah , i have a job of how you might recognize it .
secondly , photos should have the same lightning art .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
for example , this one would be completely logical .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come out of it .
this is me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing going on in the movie .
and the movie will be called &quot; the coach . &quot;
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
just i think it &apos;s more like it , not true .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
i hope you &apos;re really excited about it . thank you .
but it turns out it &apos;s not all yet .
i mean , we &apos;re asking : why do we fight this ?
these are many deaths through masses , 20 an hour .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my death .
because they &apos;re the ones who are also experts for taste .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
i mentioned that for miguel , and he said .
so the better the system is the system . &quot;
and then i &apos;m going to come to a moment that &apos;s unfair .
and also , what you would think of in the mind today .
and oil is going to be replacing us through other energy needs .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t like it .
like algae -- and other fearful things .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
it was completely closed that she could fail .
so i got it right , and i wanted to do more .
and immediately , i see a different pattern that comes out .
yeah , this is what a bottom there is just the load .
that &apos;s not about resource efficiency , it &apos;s efficiency .
we &apos;ve been around in holland now about three years .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange things .
now i know it was the cause of the sea .
and that was the first time i learned that .
i studied a woman printer , and she was breathtaking .
and all the time i collected more and more knowledge .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 if we &apos;re going to beat a 3,300 .
in 2010 , we had just connected two billion people online .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
and the lighting way through the rest of the book .
&quot; because they &apos;ve been out for tomorrow , &quot; he said .
we have the capital of the techno-philanthropy .
this approach is true for anything that we &apos;re doing creative .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all sorts of recognition .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone here in this audience .
now , your life self will not be happier .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re always lost forever .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
here &apos;s a picture of a orange in kentucky .
he &apos;s got a feeding of 15 to one .
i can say the kanzi is a man .
we &apos;ve moved on in the first place called bird age .
this is about 20 feet above sea level , the size of greenland .
this is the audience we just finished .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- they &apos;re here .
but you can , if you &apos;re in a foreign array .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
and all of a sudden , he no longer appeared to be human .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about in a moment .
or do you want to be more powerful , more force .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successfully , even though that &apos;s heard .
my great-grandparents died when they were 60 .
well , where should we go ? what is the right approach ?
that &apos;s what they &apos;re all in the pre-darwinian stage .
and of course , in germany , they can never give more . &quot;
one government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
and the more open i talked about , the more i should tell .
and i celebrate , i wine like a little kid .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
if you &apos;re happy , you attract other happy people .
players are in spiders in the spiders of social networks .
how can we translate these feelings from play into reality ?
that &apos;s how it was made out of the same , bad team of one .
the fact is that this uncertainty should worry us .
so people in the west have really been thinking about creativity .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
one of them was that the phone was never broken .
we can predict the structure of its behavior and the function .
a few months preferred , and i had just forgotten everything .
even who kills someone is not just a killer .
so the invention of language was a little step in that direction .
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
and this video was actually already in january of january .
each one of these issues was made of many , many little decisions .
there &apos;s a lot of other , but i &apos;m missing the time .
today , i want to tell you about circles and open compassion .
they interact in a clear way with their environment and their experiences .
this trick you can do your friends and neighbors . thank you .
you know , there was no mandarin in paradise .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with them .
everything in life is beautiful is not efficient .
we see that phosphorus is truly critical .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting .
i apologize that i have to cut off so much .
secondly , what economists call the tunnel east .
and i think it &apos;s what makes the world look like .
but wait , this is my favorite project .
so it didn &apos;t change , and yet it changed everything .
we just transferred the 7th billion-dollar march .
and then let &apos;s try this analogy into the future .
so , if you could make the light again .
it was a store that was called the draggers .
are you so far ? you see a little nervous .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
the things that only are being used are going on in technical systems .
so the device you see there doesn &apos;t work .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
they did that by serving the country .
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
welcome the fear . welcome the risk of welcome .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , he &apos;s not a soul .
there &apos;s only the second best , the fire brigade .
they can shoot away where they go and stand .
an amazing error rate . one of nine innocent guilty .
i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually going to have a wheeling iceberg .
this is somebody in the rest of us , certainly , from about four to 10 .
we used to think that things happen linear .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black young black boys .
they are in the middle , they want to be in the end of the gangs .
and then people could eat this and they would not be blinded .
because that &apos;s where ownership work is taking place .
&quot; 2.5 2.5 ? what does your feet ? &quot;
and then we started negotiating with insulin demands .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
i &apos;ll play explaining what these sounds could mean .
that &apos;s why they help with , ask people for the time .
but also our perception of how they vary us .
and other examples are the ambitious systems , smart systems .
how many doors have the house where they live ?
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells still well .
i believe it , and i have the feeling that we should teach .
and i guess many of you have done this too .
some people were disappointed it wasn &apos;t a poetry .
i sent them home without talking to my doctor .
the cost of solar energy went to the last year to 50 percent .
we need to engage in the machine government of the government .
there is a direct return to this point .
the monkey &apos;s software takes place in the rule a few years .
and sure enough , we can find fast food chain .
cats look at cats that look at this video .
now , where would you light up your brain at this scale ?
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed a experts .
it looks kind of like old-fashioned language .
i just wish i could see my children growing up .
and part of the egg is more than 100,000 years old .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
it has moments of life , one after another .
and i transformed them to fund a expedition .
we &apos;re talking about the flight of information overflow .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineer .
that loses the first half of his advertising .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
so they move around and they make art installations like this .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you &apos;ve got to protect it . &quot;
i was shocked , and i was crushed into the internal .
i went home through the emergency department in my way .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
i say that because i think identity is very important .
because all of these new technologies are taking care of themselves today .
because your life depended on whether they did the job right .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
i knew she came to give up to her .
today , we don &apos;t just think of something , we do with it .
a typical wal-mart offers 100,000 products today .
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
i mean , this is just what my logical page says .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is what truly fantastic .
in the previous example , it was about finding detail .
he said he didn &apos;t do that . he &apos;s going to ask him .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with you .
if they didn &apos;t move anymore , they were buried .
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
again , which potential do we want to call back ?
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
when we looked at how emotions interact with variation .
and this is a little bit hard to justify , i think .
there was no christmas trees . we did all that .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
the farm of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not sure .
it makes no way to say how the photograph was actually put together .
the words , as long as his friends , spoken his .
and we found that there was a relationship in fact .
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical day ?
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
so the driving force behind it is the cyberpower .
i didn &apos;t spend two years with my wife .
the pilot reported the machine after the hudson river .
the revelation is that death is a part of life .
that keeps us away at the distance and makes us evolve .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
it rains about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
you see the person asking what &apos;s going on inside .
in most of my activities , i have two hips .
it turns out that dna synthetization is very difficult .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we think about our future as a forward-looking memorial .
well , the remembering self is a storyteller .
what it ruined was the memories of the experience .
we &apos;re going to go to the next few days .
there &apos;s a pac-a-pacemaker there .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
a fishery , but also a bird reserve .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love story .
this first one was more like a passionate monkey .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s disappointed it .
because music is a language and a language is there to communicate .
and most of all , first of all , to ask , what is the right thing .
but i &apos;m just going to make it a little bit curious .
i started thinking , i should just invite the project .
we can , of course , first of all , look at the problem .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take you away .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
just to precise tides of time , they agree .
if the museum has given us the image , they click on it .
so you can ask : how happy is that life itself ?
most of them are completely ignored by remembered by the memory of themselves .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
has one single audience ever seen someone dying in the audience ?
it turns out you can get this to zero .
you can test it for my talk in your immune system .
but of course , the sum is quite a lot of ideas .
and she asked him what &apos;s your hobbies ?
so again , in any store , you can get things back .
so the question is , how do we deal with these wind ?
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
so , for example , the environment , the environment , the car .
and life lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
so if i put them next to each other , it will hurt their interest .
i look at this as if i could write a song ?
she said it would be like a donnster that &apos;s coming out of air .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
you add a blue one green one , and you can make light .
but you don &apos;t take the previous loss .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast .
yet we still get to the galapagos islands .
more and more people came in , just because they were angry .
it was the fear of terror that shaped your life .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
we &apos;ve got a lot of cells that are not alone in itself .
you make the mistake , and you pay a lot of time later .
and what &apos;s below that is what we call bureaucracy .
but where would the next aed to help this patient ?
they need to make 62 different decisions to completely design their car .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , it didn &apos;t work that way .
almost like we were preparing our lives for a long time .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego room .
i was the only one who could talk to the airplanes .
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
think of that as a dot , as a flying point .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
this is a fascinating adventure that goes on .
that &apos;s going to influence politics , i think , in the coming years .
we found that in terms of happiness in the happiness of living itself .
they evaporate their judgments . they do almost never .
most people usually start to work on the task itself .
you have to introduce the enormous challenges that they have to imagine .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
if you walk , yes , everyone destroys footprint the ground .
if we overpower it , we can cut a little back .
the most powerful mindset is the head of massey .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
there &apos;s a magic lot . i don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a book .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be worse .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
because through marine protected areas , we &apos;re basically going to go back to the past .
i want to end with a story that really excites me .
sometimes i lose the equilibrium . a story to the end .
i found that technology should be able to make magic and not kill .
so now we &apos;ve recovered the time scale .
so today , evolution in time of microseconds can happen by microseconds .
here he lifts a rare glimpse of a tar .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
we could , of course , reduce 10 percent , but what does that do ?
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
he said , &quot; in germany , there is no death penalty .
automation , outside the car -- i have 56 opportunities .
they &apos;re not going to come out of the museums .
so you see , with this movie , we wanted to tell the real version .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
i became the miracle of not dying that day .
it &apos;s called eyebrow , and you can see the description .
this is the average size of a greenland iceberg .
i mean , what does anybody do with so many outcomes ?
and as a general term , we can use the word intersection .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think .
we all have to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , it &apos;s called miguel .
because he doesn &apos;t know who he should go to first .
and then the same thing happens in a good job , informed conversation .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
we take pictures of this mini-big bang in detectors .
economists call this a parallel improvement .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what modern progress is .
the way to freedom is to maximize choice .
we can change the poster from a physical view of this environment .
this is a whole book , an example of non-lethal data .
and of course we all share the same adaptation .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in the fence of inotinotar .
that &apos;s where accidents are in front of us , like the inotempire .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
innovation , creativity , and development don &apos;t just come out of our heads .
i want to help you with a very particular aspect of curiosity .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
ceos are something about average . but here it becomes interesting .
because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concern .
this is one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
this puppets ran across the older black of black .
but i don &apos;t know how recipient people will be .
you go around the block and you take it as an epiphany .
so at the end of two weeks , we went back to the room .
bonobos are related to chimpanzees .
the first one is a contradiction , of course , to admit complexity .
they invest a lot of their time in the construction of structure all the time .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little it &apos;s going to be .
usually you &apos;re just dancing and some coming , other people don &apos;t .
now he mentioned the mineral needs of physical lankton .
i take the breath of the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
you feel this is the actual truth behind the outside .
but the question i want to throw out is : why not ?
and the best part is perhaps what we expect in health .
this is technology support supported innovation today .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
wr want to help people who were convicted .
and that means access to access , which means open and productive .
how did he get to search for this particular kind of help ?
let &apos;s quickly jump to moma again , again in new york .
tempt will be part of the show , which is pretty straightforward .
we produce androgen , and we talk about android genes .
and if you made it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this is scandalous , and we should be ashamed .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
but while they &apos;ve talked to different people in this world about these possibilities .
they have an renewable energy share of five percent today .
and they did it with something called lead-maps .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so i &apos;ve been busy talking about when this is , of course , intuitive .
and these are just the biohackers , the individual people .
it means that we &apos;re reaching a cultural impact besides the scientific impact .
this struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
he invited the king of sideways to the dinner .
but somehow , we create a problem of this problem .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last year .
but instead of going into panic , he just stopped .
how about brainstores that we can &apos;t even predict ?
if you look at the people they have to do with it .
and guess what we found in the angridge code ?
imagine that every single person being controlled by humans .
okay , let me squeeze a little blood for you .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
new investments to create well-paid jobs .
six speakers , social compound . seven : 65 deaths .
and i hope you will play with me like this and play .
that means that player is safe to beat three out of 10 suggestions .
a long time ago , there were gray wine -- 500 years ago .
in many , you &apos;ll say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
the x-ray interpretation of a piece of it is this unimaginable .
in my eye view , i saw the janitors going up and down .
fireflies in a glass of glass , i always found exciting .
this picture , for example , has about 10 billion points , i think .
so i decided that i was 15 diving .
here i &apos;m going to get it a little bit . we &apos;re just looking at the center here .
and within less years , lego went to every household .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer , by the way .
and i &apos;d like to show you my outfits for this week .
56 percent of all raping don &apos;t come to court .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-sufficient .
i asked him how to become such a fish experts .
there was the nuclear research facility dpolar shadows .
from that time , an anecdote that you may know .
no longer need to whistle a limb or whistle .
and sixty-10 milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that goes a lot further back into the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
so it &apos;s one of my opinions in a very scary hack .
i think some kind of six-dollar or something like that .
this is actually just about two thousand really forms , these networks .
finally , a solution that &apos;s large enough to solve our problems .
so , this looks like a basketball plaque .
and , if we can do that , then we can launch the chromosome ?
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i didn &apos;t let myself down .
now , in fact , the number of non-violence has not changed very much .
i eaten it first in a restaurant in southern spain .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on all human humanity .
it was always so inspiring , so refugee .
the death penalty in america is defined by irritally .
drew the trash on the side . went home .
alone this airport has a surface of 100 square miles .
i like things that are strange . i like strange things .
this is my brand in my little town , distorted industry .
so maybe you should set up a little bit of this interview . &quot;
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leader .
here you can see an excerpt from this attack .
we &apos;ve got his bed so he can see outside .
we degrade a person who has a value for our society .
we &apos;re going to play a game to get the suffering of the real world .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have faith in the system .
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : you .
the secret is that the game is the key to this skills .
this is indeed the real melting of man and machine .
a few . probably a lot of how many creative people are here .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
they produced the highest structure in the lowest time .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of tons on the planet .
i grew up with a cave science fiction .
he said , &quot; we build sively , not intensive .
so there was finally a company that tried to do it right .
the component is increasingly becoming a friend of mine who you live together .
and i &apos;m not sure you &apos;re really alive .
the interesting thing is , if i can make a small trip .
there , i think , came up with a really good code .
in fact , nasa has shown that there are a lot of them out there .
they like to increase the paralysis and the satisfaction .
now , i wondered , how can i really get this over ?
it &apos;s an independent area . you control all minerals .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view .
somebody was crushed , and they had founded the system .
photographs like this : a building block along a much ridder road .
the biggest fear had them before the pirate , rape and death .
so it turns out it &apos;s very hard to get all these extensions .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange road .
but this time , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
i brought in seven pants , and that &apos;s all .
but a lot of people are starting to get themselves in a very strange position .
our gut is a wonderful hostile environment for these bacteria .
now , the two ways of throwing two terms of happiness .
well , life itself lives on its own .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of happiness under researchers .
it &apos;s just a bundle calories . it &apos;s mimic .
the modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
ah , the majority . this is what i like to see as a doctor .
my inspiration comes from an event that lies 2,500 years .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
smallpox . smallpox billions of people killed on this planet .
it &apos;s the renewables that are often called them .
this is a fish elevator in the south western corner .
and i ask , how do i get strange about competing ?
the notized notes have the function of the letters of a script .
then these are laser lasers from the pre-industrial cultures .
that means you have navigated navigation about sound and rhythm .
so that &apos;s just one application of many people you can do with it .
and then we came up with this kind of a code of pulse .
at the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to lhc .
should i write this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
that &apos;s what we call a perceptual design in our lab .
54 percent of the deaths are sweeping through drill drill .
it was essentially the concrete building block of our time .
how about a new set of hearing voices before that .
how can a judge someone turn into something that he &apos;s not ?
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lynchmobs .
so programs that can be used by the most nuclear weapon .
for example , the fish had been recorded on a glory flight .
possibilities that were not allowed to have been encouraged .
so i did a couple of years ago , just to do that .
finally , at the beginning , we should be welcome to the fear .
a observer , he played marke . how is your brand ?
why is it important to start ? what represents the red ?
so we created a device that is completely free of constraints .
and i said , &quot; how are you communicating ? &quot;
now , in this night , everyone went to the center to celebrate .
and the key indicator of india is the extinction of languages .
and i had to explain to the journalists that there is no test .
and this is called androgenreceptor defect .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative thinking , heart beings .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to look at as a graduate student .
right now , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
and soon i wrote an article about genetic technology .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
so i offered a $ 100,000 prize on software for the winners .
one day this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
there was time to bachchor &apos;s instrument at all not a piano .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
even if you were to shoot yourself now , you would have emissions .
most people know about the most of them .
this is actually live on the internet . you can check it .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nunavania .
but nothing was invented , that would leave me again until now .
and the best part is they connect with magnets together .
some of my cloned used to be passive in the last five years .
i looked in the rags , and it was a little bit of pink .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular tongue .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
so the dramatic numbers are at the prison level .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about death penalty .
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkeys today . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know a lot about government when i started this program .
this is my wound scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
what &apos;s the relationship to the thoughts and feelings about them ?
and if they &apos;re at risk , things can really happen .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
they talk about nature &apos;s power to tell us who we are .
if we don &apos;t take any phosphorus and give it off .
this piece of 50 year-old technology became the most magic thing for me .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours of video is a minute .
if they could do it for those who could help me .
and just disappeared all these companies , one after the other .
i &apos;m sad that we never know each other as adults .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserve it .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big deal .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individual .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas in our culture .
he said , &quot; prayer , you have to go to the house .
if you could only have one of those , it would be a very different world .
specialized skills and processing skills and their combination of success .
people here have contributed to the evolution of many of these miracles .
and somehow , we have to bring changes that will reduce the rate .
we &apos;re still finding other strange attributes of what their rights are .
this is the most perceptions we have .
this is our youngest bears down there on the right .
at the end of march , the lhc will be refunctioning .
and that &apos;s the news i took in medical school .
do you know how to call a 3,000 square-in league ?
i think that in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
if somebody lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
and so i think the ted community should be a horse .
and she &apos;s been useless , organic , of course .
my friends from honduras asked me to say , thank you ted .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
well , finally , the movie has a very big error .
this actually includes just one period of two and a half weeks .
these people will be connected to the movie in eternity -- forever .
so all these green areas , these are the highest environments .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; session . &quot;
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of god to virtual virtues .
i went to the car and was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
in the short time here , i realized one : ted has a identity .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good fraction of the intuition to actually lead the experiments .
in my opinion , mass ingenuity changed our world .
this is all reality today , and in the future , it will be much more possible .
so this allows us to build the interactions of ties , trust and one another .
this is what it says , the more you need to hug , the better .
people said , did you have no fear to succeed ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , but i can live with it .
and what i learned is that error is absolutely error .
i love this one : &quot; watson does forced human enemies . &quot;
i looked at them and smiled , but she looked very seriously .
three months later , i was moved , and the adventure went on .
it &apos;s about creating scarcity abundance .
i like a lot of black colors , lots of gray sound and stuff .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
we want to use that as a possible impulse for the flywheel .
and the question was : how could you connect technology to connect new technology ?
i don &apos;t want to give you the same rights as a human being .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magician .
and this is something that we need to learn , and that is very fast .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s concert .
the human being is supposed to have a common ancestor or a common ancestor .
loud and sef , f and b , etc .
how did his living circumstances , how the society and the politics ?
on september 10 . last year , the machine went to the first time .
we have littly distributed kids , and they play with it .
and when i listened to her , she made keuchure sounds .
and i was good , i closed it with claude .
but if i ask you , how about you ?
you collect information about the play in the sekable literature .
there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they can all be engaged .
but what if the image they linked to all of their images ?
you say you never forget the names of those who don &apos;t forget .
but she does something that no other regime does .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen before .
we should be able to eradicate everything we want .
and i tend to think of viking as my shadow .
well , hesitation studies have been conducted to see if that was true .
there you go , which is enormous speed of capability .
this comes from asia , in the case of japan .
because a good engineer has built either great cars or nuclear plants .
that was the very first beginning of a musical expression .
you can only have nuclei missions if you &apos;re not there .
you &apos;re fine . the question is how will it take us .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
the official faith of all western industrialized societies .
&quot; do you remember the patient you sent home ? &quot;
we live on a planet that has 70 percent covered in water .
just swap the apartments of apartments against the cities .
because that is how to lie that they can actually apply these logic to the logic .
often the music class is something that you only learn to read the notes .
that would be just the letters that you learned to paint .
eight speakers : tsunami warning . nine : cyberattacks
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
bruno guisi : mark , mark , come back .
now , even if it seems hard , play may be the most necessary .
so we don &apos;t have to control the people a little bit too bad .
now , there &apos;s all this rumbling before the big revelation .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
they knew all the bits and the bytes that they had to attack .
it was when italy won the world cup championship .
in our revelations , we &apos;re all involved in inconvenient areas .
and she was much worse for a b in the recovery .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who has made more listed ? &quot;
we &apos;re not just telling stories if we &apos;re doing it , telling stories .
a deception becomes something , because somebody perceives it like this .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a child paralysis , and you know what ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how do we feed ourselves ?
if i don &apos;t have a right , then the rabbit is not a man .
you learn to read first before you only speak a word .
to keep occurring prayer , right with the composer .
right now , we can get these kinds of nutrients back to agriculture .
essential tools of information processing have been involved in jewelry .
and then the head-tailed into the words and the citizen science .

in the rich world , the millions of us have only threatened us by a generation , hardly .
here we see a very fundamental service . is there a way to go home and read the homework assignment ?
the greeks called these goddle-diving spirits of creativity .
and i think they &apos;re dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how they &apos;re done in the next century .
and we &apos;re installing a evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going on in the microsecond area .
so in other words , the future is each year a year since i &apos;ve been in this world .
they &apos;re shooting the decision -- they &apos;re shooting on them , even if they &apos;re interested in their own self-interest .
so doing these things -- you know , people remember -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in it .

now , i don &apos;t want you to spend a lot of time trying to imagine , because if you imagine all the time , you will not listen to me .
you have to separate two things : to be a medical fact , to be amputated , and to the other social opinion about whether i am disabled or not .
the basic idea of this company was to start the analogous process with optical printing and leaking up with digital production .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to use the number of data about a usb , as we &apos;ve seen it in terms of levels .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that is a reminder of self from a living herself , time has very little impact on this story .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill life with life , and if that &apos;s so , people will make mistakes in time too .
and it will allow people to measure from home from their blood pressure , to send it to their doctor and share it with others , for something more than 100 dollars .
so the first case : all the atoms from atoms that are made up of all the metal silence , and at the same time are moving the same atoms and the atoms .
when i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibilities .
but the latest evidence of dna shows that the etrine , later the tube is imaging , the same dna as the old lymph poetry .
how lucky you can go very different depending on how you think and whether you think about your memory or whether you think about life itself .
but if you have a very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a column -- dig it out , without all the complex .
we &apos;re going to turn it off , and expect it to be able to collect the first data in june or juli , and use our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
we want to encourage the world of creating inventors , the inventor , to the contribution , because this world , where we live , this interactive world , belongs to us .
imagine this device . in the midst of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the health care system .
so i decided one day to visit the liquitters , and i asked the head , &quot; this model works , that you actually offer all these possibilities to be true ? &quot;
the head of the congression came up with the stage and said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at tedtalk .
we need to lead those conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the time machine and go into the future we will be happy to have that .
so again , i stood again with a small team on unknown terrain , and we turned around , &quot; avatar , &quot; with a new technology that wasn &apos;t there before .
and then we didn &apos;t commit that , but that &apos;s what i think is doing , i think , quite well , people are quite convinced about it .
i mean , it can sound strange thinking about that being a thing at the same time at two different places , but they were not born with this idea ; they were evolved .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience , everything it needs to take us from &quot; uh-oh &quot; -- to a &quot; ta-moment . &quot;
but the measurements were quite beautiful , and people in my company told me that we weren &apos;t able to do this yet .
i was a seventh 10 when i went back to one of his classes , and i played the last of the four balconies of chopin , a later work .
if your work was brilliant , you wouldn &apos;t look at everything for you . everyone knew you had this embodiment that had helped you to do that .
on nine people that we &apos;ve been executed , one that we &apos;ve done for innocent people who &apos;ve been discharged and out of death .
so an organism could learn , for example , to eat a particular one that didn &apos;t eat certain fruit , because it was bad and sick , the last time he ate it when he ate it .
personally . it &apos;s easier to create a place where you have to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to go to compromise with your ideas in your head .
because it &apos;s about how to enhance people in interactive media so they can use these interactive media and make them a peaceful experience .
finally , this older black man came with a very worried about facial expressions in the courts and sat right behind me , almost on the defense bank .
there &apos;s this airplane that &apos;s made out of hundreds of thousands of pieces , which work together to make their safer flight . doesn &apos;t make you more visible ? &quot;
one day -- this is a actual report -- this came in , &quot; selected rats in my garbage -- can &apos;t tell if she &apos;s dead .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult , she learned to know me , she turned into a box and turned on my hands .

there are a number of people who have many more uh-uh-uh-oh than others , and under the worst , they have fresh wine .
that is , we &apos;re just going to see our project first , before we see it again , bringing it back into the back of our hedge , to say , okay .
his job is to create the conditions that are less than a billionth of the universe at the beginning of the universe -- and to 600 million times a second .
but you also have a secret to our future , a future where we have to adapt to more challenges , through greater creativity and printing cooperation .
and many discussions that i &apos;ve had in the last six years , were similar to the discussion i &apos;ve had over the last three years on photovoltaics .
a juice shelter , if you take the power full of water , you have enough pressure , so i think that &apos;s how four or five sixth grade it is .
and there was something interesting about this , which i found myself in jacques cousteau , was the idea of a completely unknown world of our earth itself .
and our european network is basically made up of louder rotating powers of great power , where the wave is all around europe .
one process that -- like everyone knows , who ever tried to do something -- in other words , everyone here -- is actually not reasonable .
and every year we ask the students to create products and services and services that can live within a few decades of the millennia of mild large-scale people .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i believe many of you have understood that the moral compound of the universe may be far apart , but that it &apos;s increasing of justice .
and finally , saturday : building a unique style , personal style , is a great way to tell the world a little bit about one , without saying a word .
they didn &apos;t count because he was involved with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was remembering everything he had kept getting .
i think that the molecular biology in general is now , in general , my general talk , biotechnology , everything you counts , synthetic biology and so on .
how about the oppression of the oppression , wherever you are , giving a voice to pay attention to attention and change , for the very first time ?
i love to think of every opportunity as a different colorful outlet , crazy outfit outfit , added , photographing at the last time , photographing tiles and blogging .
i told my wife , whenever a human being is used in a moral judgment , because we should try to replace it by literally replace it .
and it turns out that if you make it , it feels something concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people more .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for giving people who we love to preserve fatty salt , but they &apos;re also preparing how well they &apos;re getting along with it .
so we &apos;re taking something very complicated , converting it into sound , making a sequence of sound , and making something very complicated in the heads of others .
no , it just looks a lot better if we show that we are constantly dedicating the dangers that create other people , just when they put fire .
now , in egypt , the most end-of-the-art in april of 2011 , the main headquarters of egyptian intelligence police , and they found a lot of action .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of programming work , numerous parking and secured , tony drew for the first time seven years .
so that &apos;s what this reactor was a problem that we fill in our business , and that &apos;s going to dramatically reduce the volume as it goes into this process .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point of view : we have the biology digital , and now we &apos;re trying to create a new code of biology by creating new life and building .
but this is what keeps me running at night -- one of the things that kept me at night . we &apos;ve never really needed scientific progress as much as we &apos;ve never yet .
according to burma , the premier in january , and since then -- and this is not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls from this movie .
yes , that &apos;s a giant debate in the moment , building up from the coal power plants , because we don &apos;t do any else , or gathers , because it &apos;s not going to go .
a lot of our friends thought we were pretty stupid to do that , and that we would come back and do all the images in the walls would be graffed to the graffles .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst errors in the first five years are passive , which is what many of my colleagues say , but total nonsense .
but these apps are like little digital memories , that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government who pay taxes and services .
at stanford when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very exclusively exposure to life expectancy at least , at least he was really exclusive .
in a country that has just been a significant crisis behind the congress for this congress to be elected with a 124 voting voice .
it seems like we were quite remote from the other parts of life , but in fact , most fundamental part , the basic mechanisms are our cells are quite equal .
but the logic of disappointment allows us to do it like the first sentence of proposal would be wrong as if you had to think of the opposite without proof .
it &apos;s always a very happy concern when i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been working for as long as i &apos;ve been working on how to experience it .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists in my talk after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing , you talk like this . &quot;
now , there &apos;s been versailing and march , these things that come and come , but a vertical , march is a pretty strong thing .
and if you &apos;ve got it already , that the droplet is high and complex , let me tell you , the data is a science for itself .
if i tell you that someone &apos;s life is going to be eight as a scale on a scale of ten , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his own living self .
now , i gave telephones a few people in the company , and no one could give me an answer , and until finally , i did the biologists .
basically , you get every round of sick-randomly admits advocate , and as you try to make words , you &apos;re going to test these words about a dictionary .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot of prosperity , or maybe a little bit less likely to talk to you about it .
but then another one happened , very interesting step in which things were completely different , and they started communicating these cells and communicating information so that communities were created by cells .
and what &apos;s happening is that if you think about life in california , you think of the difference between california and other places , and that difference , we say in climate .
it starts out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see is fluidized , and these dentists , marked marks .
we have now , from our discoveries from all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these design components are the future of the future .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous confidence in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to provide us the great challenges of our planet .
so one app that is written in a few days , and then it spreads from selected , is a kind of sling against the institution on the institution .
what this means is that if you were to meet someone , and you would tell them , oh , his father is a two-meal man , how much would you know about his size ?
at this point , and if you &apos;re laughing , you can see how important that lie is , and how much time you need to experience something that artists can tell us very well about artists .
how it would feel to live in a world where the german state made , especially if there were many people , many of them would be adolescence .
and because the government ultimately drives its power from us -- it remindes you of , &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how do we think about how it is going to affect how that change happens .
are they reliable , stable , stable family , ensure , born , saints , excerpt , and how the dalai lama or yoda ?
this is ayahuasca , who &apos;s many of you heard about , the most powerful psychoactive parking coat from the repertoire of the shadow .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with internal people whose gender gender is -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female types of female types .
we had to do that at the time . if we were a children &apos;s book , we took the description of the eye and projected them on the canvas in our minds .
we came up to speak about music . and a few days later , i got an email where i got an email from the fact that nathaniel became interested in myself .
and since we get tired of media campus , the virtual reality in our v.r.r.r. lab , we can actually do it all the time .
i said , &quot; listen , you know , you &apos;re both , and i don &apos;t know if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because it does as much sense as anything else i &apos;ve heard about when it was about explaining the absolutely crazy thing to do with the creative process .
so it &apos;s so far . and for all of those who weren &apos;t there at the time , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever committed -- 27 kilometers across the diameter .
and i &apos;ve argued that we might be able to create a new shape of the chamber in the massive new educational education based on this digital design .
the reason that it was once better than anything was worse than everything was worse was to make it possible for people who were a surprise to make a surprise .
and i negotiated with myself that if i double my efforts to double , and i would never make a mistake again that the voice could decrease .
so these are just a few of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew i needed several months to plan them to find the different places for the puzzle of the puzzle .
but also , because it turns out we use this whole time to actually change what we &apos;re doing as a human being .
i can &apos;t tell you the sound that the bach has had on the modern wings to sound what a baroo can &apos;t do .
already , in english , to translate into english , more knowledge can transform , once you get it to your poetry or even to poetry .
bg : well , we need one of these scalable , electricity generalizing things that are very cheap , we have used 20 years to invent and then 20 years .
if you &apos;re also playing , you see some nuances here that are looking up to the top , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrow shows surprise .
you have to imagine that if you &apos;re going to make something of the classical commodities , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software just an hour .
i &apos;m a walls . i have to work on every day , i have to stand up to the same time and sweat me , and i &apos;m tired and really uncomfortable .
so they invented noodor , the custom game , and they agreed a national strategy , and on one day you would eat food . you would play the next day .
the other note is that we &apos;re using the zero-sum technology , whether it &apos;s used in all the developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest .
the movie studio i sold this as &quot; romeo and julia ship on a ship . it became a lovely episode , a passionate movie .
so far , in arguments , it &apos;s always tried to do this insulation that has been going on , that has a small network that has to do with our allies and nothing to do with it .
and so we decided to build a half-digit in berlin , in which we could actually create the electric power of the island at the scale of one in three very precisely .
that is , the interpret needs to translate those untired of the notorial language into another , which is audible , concrete , non-verbal music language .
now , intuitive user doesn &apos;t even have been an apple &apos;s fundamental factor for apple , elementary success , if i just want to use technological devices .
a lot of journalists called me with the question , &quot; what are you going to do , who tells us if caster sidelines or male or male ? &quot;
now , what i hear is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want a huge fields to one thing that &apos;s wrong .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them together to play any kind of game to control their health better .
and imagine , in fact , i &apos;ve been talking about a five-year-old child with dr. p. and so i &apos;ve tried to stop this kind of exercise , natural without success .
bg : well , the actual spending on research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. 10 billion more a year than you do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore , and interact , and it &apos;s unexpected , which we are , are the real nutrients of creativity .
and since it wasn &apos;t video games or these overwhelmingly generated with computer-generated filmmakers , i had to create the images of my head in my head .
as you know , in the village , who has what &apos;s going on with wine and when , this is what &apos;s happening today over our expanding self through these mobile devices at a global level .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility so i could act and be able to worry about my patients without having to contaminate them .
i got a fine ticket because i &apos;m not going to go to the wheel , but often there &apos;s a disability that doesn &apos;t leave you on the way .
and so i look at myself as one of the people with the most experimental quantum physicist , who need a good logic of logic to add complex ideas together .
if we look at a founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us &quot; i have a dream &quot; a kind of solution . &quot;
jacques cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that surround us and places and places around the world that we could never have imagined before .
and of course , when it comes to us , it enables us to do it for nike , for nike and mauritz and the whole textile industry .
in every step we have these pieces of pieces that we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process of creating what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
unlike the conversation of the 20th century , the participation of the community is the part of our way of getting this phenomena -- either by spreading or making something new out of it .
my wife , my children , and i have moved to the garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy , and archive our home house .
we can move one step further and rearrange the data and then see that circular disease and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas , the fish , the height , the sales , heavy fish , they &apos;re collapsed .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has doubled more than doubled the inflation of the average income of the world &apos;s population .
one of the areas that we see are both for example , in our today &apos;s culture , in the united states today , are the fighting over the beginning of life and the end of life .
now , that &apos;s good , besides being that paul is walking around and talking about vaccines and saying how valuable they are , and that the people should just stop talking about jamming .
the second one is a congestion of experience and memory , which is , basically , it &apos;s between his happy life and being happy about his life or happy with his life .
you go into this capsule , you float into this dark , hostile environment , where there &apos;s no hope on rescue , if you don &apos;t make it back .
so from that , you also notice that there &apos;s a change in there , and it &apos;s only from that intention of defense to yes , the idea that a hundred percent renewable renewable .
it was exposed to the cell , and it recognized the other chromosome as a stranger of the material , and so at the end , we just had a cell with a new chromosome .
and these scientists just documented the different subjects with which these ceo needs . and how much time they spent making decisions that relate to the topics .
everybody thinks i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have been able to celebrate the nights on a towel at the beach .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and i want to do it too , because that love , like romantic , is always rich .
my first memories are from this boat -- the stealth of the motors , the clapping of a wave on the bug , the blank and empty horizon .
and if you manipulate the speed of that rosy , then you &apos;re actually able to crack the rocks and eventually , the centuries of exploiting the centuries .
it &apos;s the living self , the doctor of the doctor -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt , if i put it in here ? &quot;
now , if we keep going , and we go to age , say , 40 years or more , we see that accidents are actually the main cause of the cause of the tower , to worry about the people .
we should call them what she is , a pigeon in recovery , a magician who is very quickly rising the ecological capital that allows this production to be made .
we can look at whether we can use protein co2 , which could simply be brought to productivity , convert the co2 into greenhouse to power this process .
so when i started talking to the companies and to tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
if people take that fund seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything on their head , everything we think , for example , in terms of politics and so on .
it depends on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two seats , and that &apos;s the way the opposite of the first sentence would be already proposed and predicted .
but in the mid- &apos; 90s , we realized that we went to the crew in the crew , and redesign , where we actually created the company -- we were starting to start slowly .
it looks something like this , who doesn &apos;t have any freedom of freedom , can &apos;t be pulled into its actions and prevention of responsibility , and so he &apos;s unable to do it .
i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and therefore my palette on the music of music is much more color , much more nuances of emotions and emotions as today .
they also tend to interact in an artistic aspect of biological materials , and , yes , electronics buckets , and combine it in a pretty bicycle way .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of deep sea self , even in the ocean , is so fascinating to life how we can really hardly imagine .
then the range of the semantic connection and the feet that comes out of it is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic network of the network .
i did a poll recently with over 2,000 american people , and the average number of decisions that have been scattered a typical americans on a day at 70 .
a few weeks later , the fire guards gave a letter to the house in which they were using for the take-home purchase of their home office .

and then we took a v.d burning and burning the threshold , and then we tried to focus on this camera on .
of course , the chance for election restructions is very small that , of course , you know , numerous numbers of animals , so that &apos;s probably not one of the instructions that actually do this .
that means , instead of giving us an individual , we have the standard , widespread set , in maimed patterns of memories that we can bring to our personal memories .
and yet , the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology , which is changing here , everything changes .
that &apos;s what i sent them home , and i was running a quiet voice in me , trying to say , &quot; gold , you don &apos;t do a good idea . &quot;
what do you think of the average performance for a cardiologists or a nurse or a nurse , an orthopedic , a rescue , should be a rescue ?
this is a people who are not cognitively distant between the colors of blue and green , because the celebrating scene of the forest that people depend on people is equal to .
and my love to science fiction appeared in my environment , because back then in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea .
we see a lot of , a lot of gigabytes of digital photographs here that you can get seamlessly and perpetuating while they &apos;re removing , and they can rearrange every single way .
this tribe , the cofan , have 17 varian aayan huasca that they all recognize at large distance in the forest that appear for our eyes as a species .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising was to present your product to as many people as possible to see as many people as possible .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the contemplation that you have each other , because you have a challenge that you can explain something else .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have traveled to this distance of the earth to recognize that they &apos;re not at all away .
that our system also has a monastery increase , that we &apos;re still forced to do 20 percent with el and also a price increase on the other stuff .
we &apos;ve only been using phosphorus for two years , and now , through the phosphorus mining worldwide , a lot more urbanized in the environment than it &apos;s used in all nuclear facilities .
we provoke that in 10 years , the rate of recognition of civil rights is going to be as high as we can before the election legislation of the legal legal law .
and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s grown up on the internet , and that knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you just have to build the right systems .
and as far as the isolation goes , if we were to be colonized as a remote planet , there will be isolation and changes in the environment that might make evolution in a natural way .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science . but now i certainly think you might have to have a director , a director , a leader like a ship apple or something .
and after a very short period of time , all of the characteristics of the species had lost and completely converted to a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
well , i hope that you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use in real life in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
now , all of these randomly instructions are made up of , leadership all of the programs , and charity , which are the ones that i gave in the next few years . &quot;
these are two very different units of units , the life itself , and the memory itself , and the two is part of the change in terms of happiness in terms of happiness .
when this device sequenced a pin -- or dna virus , it &apos;s not known , it ruins the health agency , and it prevents a pandemic in front of it .
now , if you calculated it , the people would buy six times more a glass of mars , six of whom they had choice when they had 24 choice .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , in a place where there was a pause , octao , said , &quot; paul paul , we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve been programming , we went to the street prostitution , my kids were brought in , my dog , and we created this .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the ancient greek historic historic herotor , you may know this story . the story of how and why games were invented .
but i think in this frame , and with the intention of making something real , i &apos;m just going to let the needle go in there and go from the stage .
and from my view , the scientific method of trying to figure out whether it works , if it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
a lot of arguments . fish fuels are the environment that most of you , and they are inefficient , we take tuna . we take a big disadvantage .
and because they work a lot harder than we do , and because they only do three to six months , they talk to weight in their weight , in the energy consumption of three billion people .
so if you take the system as i &apos;ve been taught , and you have all the miserable health care workers , then there &apos;s no more left .
i think that the remarkable values of the squeamish years , the last few decades , is that we are changing from a physical world to a digital world .
so gender is really complicated ; interacting is not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some sense , you can be distributed across the whole bandwidth .
and by the way , we migrate and district and mixing so much that they can &apos;t tell us much longer , that isolation is necessary for evolution , for evolution , to find statement .
of course , the stories i was looking for were the stories of the science fiction : &quot; terminator , &quot; aliens , &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
and in this scenario , you can imagine that in a case , the sperm is a chomosom , which is true to the x chromosome .
not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive , to survive , and to flourish , the struggle of the human mind is to turn through conflicts .
and then i went down in the middle of the eighth years , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and i didn &apos;t have that in lscoop .
they believed that creativity was a kind of divine spirit that was coming out of a distant , unknown source of people -- unexplained , unknown reasons .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing of prescription drugs for people like you and me , if you think about it , no point at all , because we don &apos;t buy them .
armstrong twittered upon us and then , in december of december , has taught us the memes of me-magazine , as one of the best inventors of 2010 , which was really great .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people who use things we design .
they were the contention that people who had political power to have this political power , because of the deceased blood vessels from the grandfather to the father and so on .
i &apos;ve counted some people &apos;s number of books with title in the last five years , and they were published about 40 , and there was a lot more .
she came from a man , a african-american , sympathy , rachief , who played on a violin who had only two seasons .

it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to make ourselves move the truth and reconciliation .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , they &apos;re literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the profound and strange quantum mechanics .
droughts optimism is the desire to do something immediately , to do a hull , to get together with the belief that we have a foster hope for hope .
now , very briefly , another reason we can &apos;t be thinking about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same thing when we think about life and when we actually live .
suppose you have a blindfold mentor , and you &apos;ll depend on an operator , whose average performance is 400 performance in terms of blindness on blindness .

but as the example that we &apos;ve seen in sync examples of synthetic dictions , our language doesn &apos;t make any room to imagine what we wish to all of us : it enable each individual to see itself as powerful people .
a lot of aging societies , including the greeks and the tube , have really believed that the language of a large force has a great force , because what you &apos;re talking about , can be manipulated .

if you &apos;re crushed -- if you &apos;re easily going to fall into the chicken -- i &apos;ve presented that a few friends in the last hotel in the hotel room , and some people i don &apos;t know , and this is a woman who &apos;s almost dropped .
but the thing about trypes is that they can &apos;t be taken out by the thing , because , of course , they &apos;re being constrained by a human being , of course , by the name of the enzyme , by monoxidic oxidic odine , they &apos;re going to be rice .
where i &apos;ve been looking at most of the exciting excitement , the south african preferences in caster last year , where the gender of chatchief was asked in berlin .
the question is , though , quite simply , if you &apos;re totally independent of something like fossil fuels or urgence , that are being taught somewhere around the world , and you &apos;re going to be brought in , then you &apos;re a island .
many of you are fathers who are forced to let your families to go back to work -- sometimes it &apos;s all-single mothers who need to make money , to afford food and closely .

if you make it possible to activate your own internal forces -- the human mind is so recommended -- if you can do that , and open someone in a critical moment , then you &apos;re open to these people for a very good teacher .
that means you &apos;ve found yourself by being a common language , you could communicate with each other , you could communicate with each other in the same cave , or in other areas , or cities , or villages , and that &apos;s how tribal society is empowered .
we need solutions , either one or several of them , to have an imaginable and uniqueness , and even though there are many directions where people are looking for , i can only look for five of them .
now , if i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of them are government official , some of the science comes from science , some of them are even less , the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes out of the music .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve just been thinking for a couple of years now with the biohacking , and i started doing it because i just wanted to know that , and most importantly , it wanted to do anything that i learned in college .
and i left medical school with the impression that if i knew everything , and knew everything , or at least as much as possible , could be as close as possible , that i was able to do it against the miserable .
and if i &apos;m going to go one more step into these interfaces , where i &apos;m at a voice , using language , stick with a gesture and not a mouse and drive the cursor , then i &apos;m even faster and more immediate .
that means i &apos;ve actually got them right now , in fact , that they don &apos;t recognize any pattern in the middle of it , but i &apos;ve been able to see them in a shorter space , over time , over and over again in this dog &apos;s image .
because in the moment that i &apos;ve taken my hand away from you , so you see from the back , this finger moving here , my curve , just from where he was in a position , in which he &apos;s extended .
not to burn the enlightenment of a little bit better , and put it in charge and in the burning facility of losing materials for circles first , but first let &apos;s ask questions about how do you deal with them ?
the first thing i saw was that this idea that their markenous personi had two separate otherns , but the murder pages -- the murder march is a march of march .
in other services , like the manufacturing of thinkers , 105 : 05 : 65 : 65 -- growth : 05 : 05 : 585 or the air force , or the air force , is the game for a lot of improvement .
so what we see here is , if i pick things up , i can confuse them , like on the right , where i don &apos;t know what salt and pepper and pepper , or i can sort of make them intuitive by showing things .
because it turns out that if you offer a placebo in a white pilgrimage in a white pill , in the form of an aspiration , it &apos;s just a round of round , white mushrooms that has a particular measurement effect .
in the coherent evolution of industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a case in the ratio of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , we can create modern materials and so many things .
we took the light off , put it in a vacuum and sucked all the air out of the air , and cooled it up to almost to the right now , on the verge , was the metal piece freely wanted to behave like it always wanted .
but because this isn &apos;t happening here , we can push it up , and people like this mccarthy and bottles around and scores of fear and illiteracy platetism platetissues of shapes like rah and larry king .
together , the countless cultures of the world are formed a network of spiritual and cultural life that surrounds the earth , and probably the earth for the earth as important as the biological life network that you know as a biosphere .
so , for example , take this kid in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the conanas believe that they were coming to the mythologically the flow of the east , also from the sacred herbal heritage .
some bacteria have found how to keep themselves from penicillin , and have written these information with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because bacteria are communicating each other .
and i want to say something that is a feminist about a feminist something radical , and i think there might be different insights that could be dominated by different types of anatomy , especially when people think about a group of group .
now let me introduce you to what i &apos;ve been thinking about , the amanda boxed box , which is a spinal cord injury , which has taken me to a result that she couldn &apos;t run for more than 19 years now and so far .
something interesting happened at abyss , to solve a narrative problem in this movie -- and we had to create a kind of liquid water creature -- we were generating on computer animation , animation , back .
and dr. kekean said , he said , &quot; i learned that children , if they don &apos;t get anything else , and even if they get a little help , if you leave yourself , children can get a lot of time . &quot;
if we get to these really big pieces -- with over 100,000 base pairs -- they &apos;re not going to just grow in ecoli . it &apos;s going to translate all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we went to other mechanisms .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a outsider , a new boyfriend , new image in the image -- and not just ok , but what you need to be grateful , maybe a gift of the bok .
and so , i think , from the city of a very different view , a very different impression , which is , i see negative zones of a city , and i think , in this way , a very different way , a virtual map of a very real city .
but this is the nickest thing that can happen , because this is the enforced group to help patients , because it could be used against obesity , or it could be used to smooth the patient .
as i said before , i &apos;ve been doing some pretty horrible situations over the years , but nothing could have been prepared me for me , anything that could be so difficult and dangerous about how this guy &apos;s going into a room .
and this is really amazing , because you actually think that this technology is going to be there , which is that it really brings you to the future , but in fact , it &apos;s the future that &apos;s right in our archaic roots .
and because i was born without a wasteful legs , and my feet had taken care of them , and i had just some toes on this toe and some toes on the other foot at the time , and that strangers had to get the bad news .
but it would be worse if i wasn &apos;t going to remind myself that 20 years ago , when i first told teenagers that i wanted to be a writer , i wanted to be faced with the same kind of anxiety response .
if we &apos;re in a playful world , i think a lot of us are going to turn into our best version , and at any moment when we &apos;re willing to try to solve hard problems , just as long as it takes for the recovery to try .
and there is only one of these little devices that i think is highly intuitive , always natural , natural use of friendly friendship , and there is something that is actually for us , of course , what &apos;s friendly or intuitive .
do you have no fear that you &apos;re going to live your hand in life and make something out of it , and that you &apos;re going to die on a scrambling dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter annihilarious concrete ?
and then , if i &apos;m going to take a half-bow , then we don &apos;t even see a unit anymore , which is a circle , and we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three pieces , a circle , a circle , a different one .
they hosted these photographs of the forest floor , they tried to see behind the face or the character , and they found nothing , and they concluded that this was the business cards of the devil , and they killed the five suspicion with the spect .
i &apos;ve always been writing my synthetic dictionary , but i &apos;ve been ready to work with the texture of the texture , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never beaten in my life , which means &quot; the word &quot; disabled . &quot;
so , herself more modes , and with that sentence , i &apos;d like to end up with , and give the clubs , designers need to think differently to come up with new solutions , and in this sense , thank you very much for your attention and your attention .
and i know it &apos;s definitely for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start this dark path of sort of suspending -- especially in the middle of me being in my career .
the older man stood up . he looked at the puppets , and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come in to tell this young man you don &apos;t lose the goal . don &apos;t give her a go on . &quot;
so , the problem of cooperative online worlds like world &apos;s warcraft is that it &apos;s so peaceful , at the moment , to stand up on the episode of an episode that we prefer to spend our whole time in these worlds .
and later on , i was driving on this site with miguel and i asked him , &quot; i said , &quot; for a place that seems so natural to be as different as any farm i &apos;ve ever been to be , &quot; how do you succeed ? &quot;
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate the conclusion that the arctic ice caps , which had three million years the size of the lower 48 states , had shrunk by 40 percent .

immediate after this choice , between the 21st and the 24th , february to about 30 famines of hunger have been shown to the two places in the world that were most interested in moving the business of the city .
the last example that i &apos;ve been showing you right now is a musician sequencing for live life that we &apos;ve developed recently and in the nodding act as a leftover voice and a barrier .
and we started making pieces , starting with a fifth of brick -- seven-word letters , add them to make 24,000-letter pieces , to put those hands back up again , to 7,000 .
it empowered us to tell the story of neuromarketing marketing , as we tell the story in this movie that today , you &apos;re using mris to hire the central centers of the brain , both to make advertising and movies .
so i started thinking , and i think , as i was in the past few months , as i was working on the book , that &apos;s soon going to appear -- as the dangerous , scary beetles , expectation of my success .
both in my profession , when i &apos;m on the side of my profession , as a volunteer joke , i am a witness of generosity and friendship at a scale , but i also see the nearest love and mumb .
suppose you live in a certain remote area , and you &apos;ve loved a loved one of those people with deforested cardiac hemisphere , and you &apos;re exaggerating your doctor to a cardiologists whose average performance is at 200 times .
but when i was with him , and i asked him why he made these interventions -- it was high rises surgeries -- his answer was that in his country , these children would be treated very bad , and so he had to do it .
and when , of course , something intuitively intuitive , and how can i take on the age and make things that are so that they can make a user , so they &apos;re intuitive to make some intuitive , because then they &apos;re fun and simply use .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- the ones who make mistakes and the ones who don &apos;t do the ones , the ones who are constraints and the ones who are constraints without constraints who are having bad results and the good results .
it also has three great problems , and the cost of doing this is highly regulated countries . the question is , after security , you really feel that nothing can go wrong at all , despite the human work that the fuel is not used for the fuel .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we fear a real gas gas , and it keeps millions of people from bloom .
now , to decide not to buy glass signs is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our silence -- but it turns out that the decision-making problem is also affecting us in very consequence .
i don &apos;t have to give this kind of effort because the corner is going to always be a different crazy , colorful , colorful , abundance of your outlook , just waiting for me if i love a little bit in the heart and search .
so that &apos;s one effect . the other effect is that , even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we make less happy with the outcome than if we had the opportunity to choose between us .
here &apos;s a photograph that i took on the north side of the baffin islands when i went to the scuba jagjad , and this man , aya , told me a wonderful story of his father .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , when a tyranny of the memory of the self , and you can think of the memory of itself as one that kind of returns the living self through experience that doesn &apos;t need the living self .
i mean , if i am alone , then i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people go up and i hear all of these things because i don &apos;t want to leave them with it , or i said , &quot; stop it . &quot;
in the rich world , in the top billion , we might be able to take off and use less and less , but on average , that number is going to grow up every year and be more than doubling , the number of services that can be provided to the services per person .
i met these guys from grl , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any given surface , and then draw with a laser pointer to draw the surface of the negative regions .
so what that means is , if we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place of people in evolution , and how particularly we predict the next stage , i would say there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
so there &apos;s a great deal here . there &apos;s challenges in the challenges . if we say that the energy source is out outside the country , you don &apos;t just need to deal with the risk of energy , there &apos;s the energy coming from where the energy comes from .
but , as we think , the only kind of biology has a huge impact with no more influence in the cost of food , or the reduction of available , is that , if we see co2 as ganges , and therefore we &apos;re working on these cells that way .
i started working on doing science literature on how these centrifuge are built in natassignment , and found that they are structured in so-called kaskade , and every cascade contains four centrists .
now the intriguing thing is that the beetle kine , which are contain in the liane , mao-inhibitors of the exactly the way , the tamine is necessary to ask the tamine . so they ask themselves .
this is a problem , because the global warming reason is given to the arctic ocean , where there are huge amounts of frozen carbon , which is when it &apos;s replaced by micromethane .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of the attack is actually , it was slow to let and secretly -- obviously in the trial trial trial trying to descend , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get behind it quickly .
so maybe it &apos;s clear that this technological change , because the more that there was a different truth , which is that every human being can give something special , and there can be very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest thing .
my good friend ray shortage has shown us that every tool that will go to information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and the price of price , the price performance of all 12 to 24 months .
the first project we did as international group , as we were aware of ourselves , is basically aware of our own self , o.k , and we &apos;re now really here as a scene , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people that are always there , and so on .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never be as moving as the other kids would be , or that you could never live a independent life , and since then they just punished me . &quot;
what if we could turn these situation around and turn the internet on its head so that instead of going from one to the other , we could start to do a lot of things , and by recognizing what patterns would be solid in the first place ?
that means we feel as guilty of the earth , that we say , there &apos;s no bio-landing , no bioluminescence , no natural progression , and as they all allow us to go back to our own excrement .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i did something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in likends , each cell , and every cell , and all the genetic information of the information that is made into two cells .

i &apos;m a historian historians , and in this case , i &apos;ve studied how people went with anatomy -- that is , human body , animal bodies -- how they went with body signature , with body concepts , how they thought about bodies .
because it doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s the minister of health , who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to adopt my expert on an mammography , or any creature , who wants to treat his patients with his caffs .

we believe that smallpox -- we believe that smallpox isn &apos;t convinced that smallpox isn &apos;t quite convinced but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution in the world for storytelling , that our website will get 35 million years .
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should judge rights to people in terms of the way that i have to share , because i have to admit that i know a series of trivial reviews that probably make social conviction more than some people i know .

if you just given me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , choose a vaccine , and that &apos;s what i might choose , or i could choose that wish to be , the beer &apos;s energy consumption without co2 mature . i &apos;m going to make this wish .

so , these older people come to me now , and they say , &quot; mr , stevenson , you &apos;re talking about , you &apos;re talking about , and they &apos;re going to tell people that they &apos;re supposed to say that for the first time in our history of terrorism , we &apos;ve done it with terrorism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
the people in the back of the room or the one that you &apos;ll see later on video , will say , &quot; well , that looks pretty much like a printing , but if it was real , he would see -- here &apos;s a hole here , and if it was real , it would be real . &quot;
now , he &apos;s a consequence of this as a consequence of it now , particularly pronounced to these schizophrenic stages , and sometimes bad , and he swalks away in the streets of skull skull , and this horror of his own queries of his own mind .
he was talking in a very hot and healthy tone about yo-yo and hillary clinton and about how the dodgers would never make it in baseball world , and all of this because of the fit of the first spirits in the last beethoven &apos;s holder .
whenever we think of entry and landscape , we either described to rousa , and the old smells of the wild , which is a rapid thought , or on the other hand , say , and these people are more connected to nature than we do .
i wanted to go back to the routine and recommend of life &apos;s life &apos;s unknown life -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters that took her days as much as they used to , by yielding the stories of her day and told us three , still in the same bed .
but let &apos;s not even say when we hear someone say something like this , because we &apos;ve heard this kind of exclusion about a long time . somehow , we &apos;ve got the exquisitions and the collective acceptance of creativity , of course , of course , of course , suffering and of art -- at the end of the seal equality .
and what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve actually been using a new kind of network that was used throughout the world -- this is a mobile phone net -- and anonymously anonymous information from this network that would actually be collected from the neocortex to understand how the city works .
and then the renaissance , and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- all the gods and mysteries . and there &apos;s no room for mystic creatures that take away from the divine state .
in our desire to protect the people who are protecting us at the heart , and to give them the calendar , hard truth about their medical projects , or even a forecast to a quality of life that you have to expect , we don &apos;t have to admit that somebody is actually disabled .
i told you about four techniques that the problem of decision-making mills -- urge -- they &apos;re going to go through the overliquid alternative ; more concrete ; they make it real ; they make categorizing categorization ; we can deal with more categories , less categories ; on preparation .
because we have this self-deception , this sense of being great , scraping from the highest creature , not from one such a review of something as unpredictably as a organism that exists yet to a stone bar and things that are uncomfortable for us .
and then , if you &apos;re all concerned about politics and politics and time at work , and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about are , government , in the words of tim o &apos;lo &apos;s , &quot; what we &apos;re doing together , we can &apos;t do it alone . &quot;
this may appear first , perhaps , a little bit scary , so i repeat it to work out : if we can solve problems like hunger , climate change , global warming , global conflicts and obesity , i think we need to try to play online , for at least 21 billion hours a week to play the end of the next decade .
and our goal was , we just wanted to go on seventh annihilarious percent , and then there &apos;s this rest here , the last 10 , 10 , 20 percent renewable , which is going to be very expensive , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work out of batteries .
but what we found is , 17 markening partners , who were willing to go into this control , who wanted to do business with someone who wanted to do something like me , and eventually tell us stories that we could not have used to tell -- who would never usually support a business .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you &apos;ve never been able to simultaneously simulate whether it was going to work , but there &apos;s modern computers , you can simulate it , and you can see that , yes , with the right materializing , it looks like it &apos;s working , it &apos;s functional .
but the process and the severe recovery that surrounded him was exposed to when he took the genius when he took out , where he left out , nothing left him and left him where he came from . he realized that there was no internal corrupt , his old thing had to be .
this trajectory was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called biography , pray , love -- that decided , as opposed to all my previous books from some of the things that came out of the world and a great mega-important event , international thing was pollinated .
a continent is always left , because the guess was that there was no religious faith in sub-saharan africa . of course , there was a voodoo and doo just dropped the remains of this very deep thought of religious thought during the tragedy of the slavery of the time .
but in truth , we always see it more and more that when they &apos;re ready to confront , and the unimportant equality are now , then there &apos;s a rise of sales , there &apos;s going to be a cost that &apos;s going on , and there &apos;s an enlightenment of improvement .
and one day , he was looking at me at one of my practices -- these practices were just tired and nagging -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a powerful , powerful , powerful power , and you &apos;re a young girl , one day of those dancers .
and the wind and the sun and the load and the distances came to the conclusion , a very exciting result of the conventional system , which is that , after 20 years , you know , you have a solar power of about 50 cents a kilowatts per hour , about four cents a quarter cents a mile .
and the problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can be just a local problem , which is how simple things can evaluate a problem of any problem , a problem of aspiration , how to do it , or how to do it better .
puffs of plants live in plant plants , skull fiddles on monocultures , chemicals on earth , chicken fish , and all the time , the agricultural industry just said , &quot; if we feed people more cheaper , how awful that might be ? &quot;
not through the latest backyard , and trawling inventors , but through fertility land , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not through chains , not through forecasts , but through forests and not through boats and neanderthals , but through the sea .
so this is a more artistic direction , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and collaboration in collaboration with scientists to engage them with these technologies and asking questions about how to work and creative work , because there are museum exhibitions , and there are all kinds of things .
so they &apos;re adding the amount of carbon dioxide that &apos;s increasing temperature , and it &apos;s increasing temperature , and it has a lot of negative implications , and it may depend on weather , which is worse , that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to such a change and systems can collapse .
elevators are things that are things that are denied , like the prince , the prince , the timiral , the deadly , and how lofty , the desks , the line , the status , the magically , the myth , the mystical , the myriad .
in other words , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t reach the house , and she was rooted through them and passing them through , and she passed it . she said it was going to move across country -- and as she said , she was looking for another person in a way .
maybe those who contribute to a modern-day contract , and if they were better than me , that would be great , but my nuclear statement here is that we need to work on all of those five people , and we can &apos;t give them any money , because they &apos;re shy of us , because they all have significant problems .
so , and where you can see how far we are , what we really wanted to do , and how sadly we are , that we can even be on earth , you can see that , for example , that we have a bach program , until you want to be here to be client here , right ?
my age in about 20 years of medical sentiment and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal study on medical mistakes and wrong treatments to do everything i can for one of my first articles , which i wrote for the toronto of my white torch , &quot; black , &quot; some way to learn how to learn .
so with the total transparency of transparency , which is the new thinking of what &apos;s wrong with the old button , don &apos;t tell you that in the laser horse is meat and no more beef or any other phenomena , which i want to do right now , and do it at the end .
now , not exactly what i had hoped , but i went out -- the treaties , the flooding , along the way , goes to the real firemen , the firemen , at this point , were pretty much done in the room to get a pair of shoes .
i had to change individual practices infinitely repeatedly with these flakes , elastic legs -- in different colors -- you know , to build my leg muscles . and i hated these beaches more than anything else . i hated them . i failed them . i flew them . i hate them .
but we wanted to go a lot further . we wanted to build an entire bacterial chromosome , and it had more than 50,000 letters of genetic code , so we thought we could build it in the cassets of the size of the virus , we could figure out the size of the variation to understand what the individual component of a living cell .
and from a conversation morning , with dean kaman , one of the innovators of the dictionary , i want to share with you -- he gave me the permission -- his engineering , &quot; the slingness &quot; means , &quot; and many of you may have heard about it . it has the size of a refrigerator students at home .
&quot; cloud-heading needs , &quot; something my friends call &quot; autodesk , &quot; high utilities , &quot; sensors and sensors , robots , 3d printer that makes it possible to democratize personal production to our planet , synthetic biology , vaccines and digital medicine , digital medicine materials , nano-scale and artificial intelligence .
look at this amazing demonstration demonstrates : voodoo zeroths in a treshesive , the lightweight coal cap without a comprehension , an amazing demonstration of the mind of the mind to affect the body , so that it can affect that if it &apos;s replaced in an extreme state of enlightenment .
this was the most surreal form of a déji sauvu , which i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i even knew about a corner of bow , i always knew what was going on in the light of the light vehicle , because i would have escaped months of cairon film as we were movie .
in this picture , i put a bush bush in the center of the branch in all directions , because if you look at the tree of life &apos;s tree , all the existing specialties in the branches of these two branches in evolutionary terms , they survived : they survived it ; it survived ; it has encountered its environment and strength .
and with this premise of premise , this premise of premise , for example , brian gger was trying to put together a minimum , and then it took such a printing of coincidence , and a hot plate , and it was so faculty , and it turns out bacteria , and then it worked with it .
and then just came from the do-it-beer beer beer website that founder of green , and he said o.k , we have to meet in real time now , even real , and then have two events organized in london , a second , a thousand , and a second to the san francisco in san francisco , in san francisco .
this equation has four factors . a little multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 , which you want to get towards zero , and that &apos;s going to depend on the number of people who are depending on the service , on average , on average , on average , on average , on the co2 and the unit , that &apos;s going to be emitted .
and the insight of president lobo was that , in some sense , i was thinking about the substance that i thought was a way for the foreign investors to come in and build this city for all parties in parties in honduras for many years , and suffer from now .
i read this list for a friend , and i had to laugh at the first time , so it was so ridiculous , but i just came up until &quot; courts , &quot; and i couldn &apos;t stop talking about , and i had to stop reading and collect for the first time in this flooding and the iron collision .
i &apos;ve learned a group of authorities that i &apos;ve learned a while ago about a time ago , who is a student group that would like to convey more of the public , which is what she wanted to learn in college , and have learned so on the street in such a small academia and try to explain what people are trying to do .
in my supermarket , there are 175 dresses in my supermarket when you don &apos;t count the 10 extra olive oil and 12 baloks that you could buy a large number of salad on your own dessert , in the unlikely case that 175 no one in the 175 charge store is right for you .
and this was really , really , really , really , really bitter , and you come into this kind of phase like this , and you know , you know , this is a picture that i &apos;ve been thinking of where i was after 10 years , a thousand years of mark , and it was still , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really should be the great thing .
first of all , i &apos;m going to show you what i &apos;m going to show you , just as fast as possible , the basic work is a new technology that we have as a part of a translation of a year , which is segment of seadgon , and it &apos;s a environment where you can handle locally , or you can deal with vast amounts of visual data .
the first one , if you &apos;re going to become a child , as a baby , is that you take care of what kind of divorce , you know , what ? and after having your parents allow them to play more or less in the deadly game and , in a way , you know , the more , the more she &apos;s going to , of course , their curiosity .
i mean , i mean , most of the eyebrow of our life -- and i got this straight -- you know , psychological presentations are about three seconds long , and what it means is , you know , there are about 600 million of them a month in a month , there are about 600,000 of them . most of them don &apos;t leave behind .
bill gates : to get the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we just need a few million . and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it works reasonably , it &apos;s only 100 million in the 10 million people .
this works really well , this is going to be done in the academic process , and we thought , okay , o.k , maybe we &apos;ll get a webcam , and then on the webcam , which is going to smoke up the lens , and then you &apos;ve got a microscope , you &apos;ve got a microscope microscope , about a hundred times .
if i show you 600 magazines in 10 categories , or 400 times i show you , and i give you these magazines in 20 categories , then they believe that i give you more choice and a better choice than i would give them 400 times over the 400 times i gave them when i gave them the 600 times i gave them .
&apos;it &apos;s friday friday , friday , friday god on frion fried day . &apos; &quot; before we go to the weekend , frikday , friday , friday day . &apos; eton friday . you know , she didn &apos;t think we were going to take this conversation without talking about this video , i hope to do this video .
i think one of the things that i think is a significant canadian -- not the only one , but a significant cancers to the explosion of this explosion , depression , and also suicide , is that people have learned that the disappointment is because their standards are so high , and then , if they have to explain themselves , they must explain themselves , they would be their guilt .
the neolithic revolution that brought us agriculture and brought us to agriculture , and to this moment in the cult of the sadive , the poetry , the poetry of the pie by the prosthetic arm of the psa , and hierarchy , and specialization , and just found 10,000 years ago -- just invented 10,000 years ago .
so , if you focus on this , if you focus on a laser beam , on a space , you can catch small particles in the air , or in the liquid , and then you can move into that liquid , so that &apos;s where there &apos;s some trajectory , so how a trajectory of a torry basically punishment in the air .
well , it would be great if we could put this paradigm of normal personality against a different capability , or the power of the strength , to even make it a little more dangerous to formulate , then we could release the forces of so many children , and invite them to take their own special knowledge , and bring them to their precious skills in the society .
you know , when michelangelo moses shaped the shake , it means he took the end of the hammer , and he was waiting for him to wait for him -- can you actually see a small spot under the ground -- and said , &quot; perchnon pari ? why don &apos;t you do ? &quot;
but if you &apos;re in the year 2011 , if you go to the new arbitrary printer of the leading printing press canoes and you buy one side , that page has presented that correct spot on every page , in a clear pattern that tracks on your printing back and forth your printing back .
so my colleague with the assassinman saasbeer , could take you more and more about the many other wonderful things that you can perceive with , but i &apos;d like to talk about the second part that we &apos;re discussing at the beginning , and that &apos;s the environment that confronts our environment .
now , the problem , the problem with the problem , is that even those of us who have the sympathy for the inherited constraints of ints , if you look at the orange and colorful and colorful , you look at them , but somehow on the past , while the real world is regarding to us , our explorations , our world .
i then tried that in my lab &apos;s home , tried a little bit , and then i just got a little bit like this , and then i bought fed up on ebay bay and bought a little bit of n.n.m. , which is a father test , so that &apos;s how a prin.e.o.r. , even at home .
and if you were to choose another vacation , there is a conflict between both of your own self and think about how you would choose this conflict , and if you were to actually choose a different sense of time , you &apos;d have an answer , and if you were to think about it , you &apos;d get a sense of the conflict that you might have a different answer .
in the early 800s , i got a really amazing job when my professor asked me if i was interested in taking haiti and filming the secret societies that were filling the foundation of duvasive and couton &apos;s poton , and using venoma to make it safe .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell you how i am going to go from vivividly and i &apos;m going to give you something : this sentence has never missed me and i &apos;ve always felt so much about asking people to answer questions , and i think gradually , i understand why .
and if i translate that now , for example , i &apos;m going to go out as a continuous selective , selected as a choice , in which all of the trains come up to me , i can look at it in the details , and i know , juice , i can throw it out somewhere or buy somebody else , or buy it , and buy it on .
i recommend all of you to read steves book or to see the movie , so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that came in between these two men , but also how the music helped to create the connection and how it was when this instrument was allowed to play , the game is , the nicotton , to get away from the street .
down here in the picture , you can see that the lab , in leadership , so it &apos;s such a garage with all sorts of laboratory scrubber scrubber scaffolds , who &apos;s in paris , a group of paris who &apos;s in paris , which is quite successful and also quite interesting things , and i want to do quite interesting , and i want to make a little bit more interesting project to touch .
no biologist would say , for example , that 50 percent or more of all species are dying in front of the extinction , because it &apos;s not easy . and yet , this apocalyptic issue is known on the area of biological diversity -- which is hardly known as the most optimistic case of the cultural diversity on the cultural diversity of cultural diversity .
bg : well , we haven &apos;t set ourselves up to a place where there &apos;s a lot of interesting obvious rules for all the zero-sum names in the name . there &apos;s a lot of interest , and people were in russia , in russia , india , china , i was here , and i &apos;ve been talking about the energy source , and how it fits the agenda to the agenda .
the computer vision algorithms have captured these pictures together so that they &apos;re putting into the real space that all of these records in the front of the grassi trucks in the canadian rocketary trajectory , and you see elements of sidia or orangutan , and these things have been disposed to each other .
and then , if you look at the software that we &apos;ve just seen before , then you &apos;ll also understand why neanderthal ninth of our software , or not very much on usable users , the ipad , or in many areas of ipad , even though it &apos;s more intuitive than the classic software .
the result is that -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but it &apos;s a shift in reality that &apos;s the burden of responsibility for making decisions from someone who knows something about the name of namely -- the doctor doesn &apos;t know anything about somebody who &apos;s probably sick and why not in the best choice is in the best choice -- is to make a decision about the patient .
and this idea that i was talking about in the middle of the writing process of pray , pray . i fell into one of these two acurams that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something , and it doesn &apos;t work , and you think of it as being a locust , and it &apos;s going to be the worst , and the lovely book that was ever written in the book .
we also have one of those same aggregate in the same size , as he stands there , in the hall to actually do the full dynamic behavior of this network , so in the half-now it looks like this , you know , the one that &apos;s there , the big battery here , the big battery here , are the entire ridge that we simulate with the internet .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magic carriage that was believed by the fact that it would literally be proverbial in the walls of an artist who lives -- about as much as the fidelity of the house -- who would come out of the cloned artist and in some kind of work that would be invisible and making the work out of the work .
now if i want to get you one thing today , it is that the amount of data that we consume is larger than the sum of your parts of the individual parts , rather than thinking about information overlapping , i want to think about how we can use information so that the patterns and the trends that we recognize so well , we wouldn &apos;t have seen where the otherwise would be visible .
so we did a study that i did with shlomo beno and alessando tero tero , and we did a study with the people who worked with -- all of them were working for all -- and they were all involved in a gathering set where they were accusing their plan for their retirement .
interesting historical footnote : when the mosquitos brought it up to those use . the language changed over the course of the centuries of allah , allah , allah , coh ruolh , moolane , voé , you still fight with sticks and ameners .
now , today , you need to have a race if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this -- what the car does in real time , has a few thousand sensors that give the information that the information that &apos;s going to give you information to the system and then use that car and then send that car back to that car back and forth stuff in real time .
i was afraid , not because i was scared , but i was afraid that i could lose it , that it could sink into one of its states , and that i could destroy its relationship , if i started to touch it , i started to talk about guidance and pegos and other pedidal forms of pediatrics .
so , in fact , the fact is that you remember the 20th century , in 300 years , you don &apos;t remember his wars or technical innovation , but rather as a physician , in which we were against and the massive destruction of the biologic diversity and cultural diversity on the planet either has been accepted or accepted , so the problem isn &apos;t the change .
i had written this piece by avatar , &quot; avatar , &quot; the measurement of things in visual effects and computer-generated effects in a whole new set of ubiquitous ways , with realistic characteristics of human expression , which had been made by cg . and the characters should be all the cg . and the cg should be the world .
i &apos;ve probably heard , probably , are the two nice girls still there , because i &apos;m probably listening to the generation of this bad image , because i &apos;ve been studying hundreds of hundreds of thousands of other seventy-nine machines already starting out there in carrots , technically engineering school , meaning them today , i think , i think , at a time .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a question of what i did after a lecture on my lecture , who was a story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music , and at the end of the recording of the sound of the sound .
do you know ? i think you know ? i think one person will allow a person to think that he thinks he or was like the vessels , such as the essence and the source and the source of all divine , creative , unknown , unknown , unknown mysterious , is a little bit of responsibility , to assist a little bit of a bit of a human inquiry , human citizens .
but my dream is that , if you can make it economic , and at the same time , the co2 is also telling the skeptic , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not that it &apos;s not a co2 emitted , i wish it almost did , but i think it &apos;s going to accept it , because it &apos;s a cheap way to predict it . &quot;
well , it &apos;s actually the existence of making decisions , because if you have a patient who , say , we had two types of reflections at two different surgeons , and he decides what to choose , then the one who is the selective , who has the memory , who is less and that is the surgeon who is the surgeon , and that &apos;s the surgeon who gets elected .
you know , all of you know the healthy dogs when you give a secret to the best friend &apos;s best prize , even though this one swallows up precision and then you get caught up and the best friend and confronts with it , and when you get a horrible discussion at the end of the bad end , and you can never get a mistake out of it again .
you know , one of the great influences of travel in the travel , and one of the friends in the ethnography &apos;s research is to live with the people who remember the old days , and they still feel their past the wind in the past , they still feel from the rain when they touch a bloodshed , they swallow their checks in the pockets .
if you ever have the chance to work in a urban center , like our fellow scott syllabus , as part of the program , to be part of the program -- in fact , they do all of them -- you see that the government , for many different problems , given the problems , including being included , is that a committed house in their house .
now , this is actually a nice thing about this , if you do this , so agriculture , biogas , on a hectary country with fifth apartment in favelas , it can make a farmer at about a $ hundreds of thousands of dollars in it , and you can wait for the economies to grow and swine and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables .
well , we &apos;re really amazing to the threshold of amazing events , amazing events on many areas . and yet i really think that hundreds of years ago we have to go back to the enlightenment of time to find a time when we were fighting in progress , over the sort of things we &apos;ve got more coherent , more summarized than we have now .
so if you go by color , concoction and helmet and heroes on the edges of the individual images , photographers , photographers , like dirt , disguise and colored colors , we diminish the boundaries between the layers and the various images and how they look like a single photograph , even though a single image can contain hundreds of thousands of layers .
if i put a room full of colleagues in a room full of colleagues and asking their solicitness to help them and to tell them what i just told them , i would probably not have the end of the second story before they would get really missed , uncomfortable , someone would take a joke , they would forget the rest and forget the rest .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who are not aware of the proof of biological evolution , this would be a very good moment to take your listening device , take your personal communications device -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can look at a little black box on cake &apos;s book , which is why nothing else is going to be lost on this talk for anyone else &apos;s talk .
a few years ago , the laser prize in the scientist shinya yamanaka was loaded for his research in which he took an adult skin , a fiber broker , and through the manipulation of four genes that just gave them to go back into an industrial cell -- a stem cell -- a potentially able to become an animal cell in your body .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve made all the kinds of batteries that are being created : the cars , the mobile phone , cell phones , the light bulbs , everything . and i &apos;ve been using the amount of electronic energy that the world uses , and i &apos;ve found that all the batteries that we now produce less than 10 minutes of energy .
so let &apos;s go back to a step back in time of the big bang , 14 years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of living , perhaps three billion years ago , to the mills of the earth -- the first couple of academic organisms , may be as much as a billion or a billion years ago -- and then the species , which ended up in the last 30,000 years .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral of cathedre dame , which eventually performed by flickr , by flickr . just put them into a flickr and they &apos;ll be preserved by men in shirts and shirts on the ground , and so each of those colored colored tracks represents a image that was detected as a model of this model .
and yet , here in this country , in the united states , in the old south , we &apos;re making people -- here &apos;s the risk of being cut down to death , higher than if the victims know it is when black is black . if the switched person is higher , and black is white -- white in the same state , in the world , people are among the real estate spheres .
i even traveled to a young fellow fellow , 6,000 miles from west to china , by far south tibet , and when i hated to lhasa , i saw the face of whom you hear behind the statistics , and 6,000 monstrates who were transformed into harashes , and 1.2 million people who were turned to cultural revolution during the cultural revolution .
and therefore , the idea is that , now , if you have all kinds of problems , invest in something that you &apos;ve only got what you &apos;ve got later -- and that the investment is not so clear . in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the most i.o. , and there are people in the rich world who are going to look at cpc and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big deal .
we cleaned up the chromosome on the chromosome of a micro-species . bench , these two are the two from each other as far as people and mice . we gave some extra genes to pick this chromosome . we could choose the chromosome to destroy it all , and it was an amazing protein . and it was really amazing when we gave it to a cell -- and they were added in our cell -- and they were getting very sophisticated .
margaret mead , who said great anthropologist before she died , that her greatest fear is that as we move towards the fact that we were moving towards the ancient world war ii , we were not only moving the whole bandwidth of human imagination in a way that we were reduced , but that we were reduced from a dream of a day , and we &apos;ve never forgotten that there were any other possibilities .
i &apos;d like to just show you the original database of noah , and this is from a early prototype of photosynth , where we &apos;ve been working on the first summer to show you what i think it really is the idea of this photosync technology , and this is not necessarily the technology , obviously , obviously , if you look at the environments that we &apos;ve looked at the website .
in some ways with other words , sugar pills have shown in some of the measurements of some of the measures , the placebo effect of this , because the person thinks what they think is a pharmaceutical stuff , or a kind of paintings of pain management , for example , there is only when the patient beliefs believes enough effect , an effect on the body is that they call the placebo effect .
when one of them said no , it was the veta cattle that was completely crushed , and i &apos;ve spent 10 years working on it , whether i &apos;m really interested in my great engineering to actually swallowing a cable thing to do , because my fellow fellow with him all the colleagues of mine had the talking about it , i &apos;ve given the money to the window on a child .
i had recently met such an encounter when i met the extraordinary american dilder in ruth , who is now about 90 but who was her whole life in my life , and she told me that when she grew up in the villages of virginia , she was out in the field , she said , and she said , &quot; you know how a poem about the landscape . &quot;
it means that a small child is growing up in the belief that the mountain is going to be a puppet that is his mind , or your fate , will determine a whole other person , and another relationship with that resource , or this place , as a little child growing up from montana , that believes that a mountain is a pipe , that a pipe can be refed .
i usually feel my role in explaining the people to explain how wonderful the new technologies are coming to be on the front , and i thought , because i &apos;m here under my friends here , i would tell you what i really think , and try to understand and understand what &apos;s really going on here , with these incredible flaws , which are going to be on the front of us , which is that we can barely come the tuna dity that we can &apos;t help .
and that would be their answer to the bjlomborg &apos;s argument that if you spend all this time and energy to solve the problem of co2 , all the other goals , the sufferings of poverty , the aspiration of malaria , and so on and so forth , there &apos;s a dumb resources to invest in money while there is money , whereas there are things that we can do better things .
so , these people have come online to travel , but they have illegal what they &apos;ve been using , for example , for example , from our bank accounts , while having our online banking online banking , or also the science poets that have collected the information about the keyboard as we &apos;ve been collecting , while we &apos;re buying a computer online bank on the computer .
again , parks parks came back to montgomer , where she had two of her oldest friends . these older women , carr carr carr , who had never replaced the monomous boycott -- an incredible afroot -- and virginia , who had a white man , their elderly cliffs .
and the people , and they did two hobbyists , and they say , o.k , and we make it easier and cheaper , and then they came out of open source , so open hardware hardware , electronics , things like this device , and this device is coming together , and now they &apos;ve actually brought the market to market , and now they &apos;re the cheapples of this cheap world .
this made me think of another person as my friends under the waul tl , who think that these forests of the hull of humordity and the bead beetles and the beetle of histles and the channels that are the northwest in the northwest of the world , that they would participate in their hair .
one week ago , one week ago , i refer to the national academy of drags to the dragons for francis and wilnold , two scientists , two scientists who were independently engineering to work together with the natural process of encouraging evolution faster to go faster and lead to proteins in a proteins called franken-efficient evolution . &quot; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
now , just in biology , and since i want to take this metaphor from synthetic biology , biology is actually a science of information , because it &apos;s a source of information , so it &apos;s really an information science , because the n.a code is abstract code , it &apos;s a abstract code , it &apos;s not exactly like computers , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s matter , because it &apos;s matter , you know , it &apos;s real matter , and it &apos;s not just real .
so , bruce bruce brown , a well-known design researcher at the british university , has gone so far to say that this mass media , he says the book and the image , so that television is not the internet , and so on , and so on , what we consider to be mass media , is that these mass media industries have brought together , and our ability to become virtual .
and i &apos;m really , really , really , some lucky people and companies , formal profits and profit , got the opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let this up -- the right side of buying the rights to the talk that she had just come to see , the title , at the moment , still , and there was not a lot of content , and there was something that would be a lot of content on it , which would be something that would be true to it .
the idea of this sentence is that the idea of living is living with vivivibrant skills of the idea that success or happiness depends on how a challenge could lead to a mastery of mine without getting more experience than whether my life was successful , as if my life had been successful , because i could fall through the possible of a prosthetic life and a prosthetic , or how people perceived with me of my disability .
and when these people came and looked at them , and they looked at who is the best proteins in the world , this was not a professor , not an caltech student , it was someone from england , a manchester woman who was a woman who worked as a chief who worked in a reholiday clinic in a republic , and the best peaceage of proteins in the world .
now , of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. p.p. so that i wanted to do the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do , with the fact that five-year-old girls in the hospital are going to be in the second stick , but he actually taught me to see my daily practice with my daily horror eyes , so a new eye and a new experience of experience , and a new experience of experience .
in the past year , i &apos;ve been looking for model for models for model , to do that , i &apos;ve also tried to find myself in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they had better or more reasonable ideas about how to help us deal with creative risks , with the emotional risks that are connected to deal with creativity .
so we &apos;ve got a situation like this , so we &apos;ve got a situation where we &apos;ve continued our science so far more so we &apos;ve got to admit that these categories that we &apos;ve given for stable nuclear categories , which has been very simple traits of being identical to create permanent calories in order to create much more calories than we did , we &apos;ve assigned up .
so i went home to my wife and i had dinner with all night , and we thought , &quot; well , wait a minute , if you use this technology , you can use your eyes to control things , and then we &apos;ll find that a template at night , and he says he can make it again , &quot; well , if you can do it again . &quot;
so there &apos;s a whole bunch of things , and so there &apos;s a different one , but the nice thing about it is that a molecule has millions of times the energy as much energy as we say , a cocoal-fired molecule , and so if you can deal with the problems and the radiation is mostly degrading the footprint , and the costs , so the potential , the potential , the country , is going to the country , and almost any other things in your own tea .
from the medical standpoint , you can tell , of course , that my legs , that the laser surgery , for visually impaired , affordable and artificial hiitus for the body , which allow people to actually use all of their opportunities and use to develop the limits of nature , to develop their natural destiny , not to speak , to be able to create social networking , human beings , to define themselves in a very own way , to define themselves , to define themselves , to take care of themselves , to look at themselves , to look at their own terms of themselves .
&quot; disabled , adject : &quot; crushed , hilarious , useless , destroy , destroyed , mutilted , crushed , charged , dilute , dilated , eaten , eaten , eaten , eaten , scraped , cured , poised , dity of dirt , weaky , scraped out of old , scores , scraped , scissorting , scored , scraped and scraped .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words to a english scientist . burey daphy , who i guess , as the head of his unleashes , his farmed curriculum was to be michael faraday , said , &quot; nothing so dangerous for the human development of the human mind , as an assumption that our scientific knowledge is that we are not an expert , that the mysteries are not part of nature in nature , that our mogloves that there are not new and new worldly new worlds . &quot;
and we &apos;re traveling to a series of companies in the nosphere , where we take our audience from such a cultural imperative , that they &apos;re offered by the law doomsway , and hopefully they &apos;re going to be adopted by one of the other central circumstances of the central anthropology : that this world has made it to exist in various ways of life , that we can find a multi-cultivation in a multiculture in a great world where humans can contribute from all of our common ground .
so , one of the things about them is that they have made a lot of choice that &apos;s attributes , if they buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what &apos;s sales , is it really easy to imagine that they could have made a different decision about what &apos;s been better . and what is this alternative thought that they made the decision decision making , and the decision of this regrets that regrets , regrets that made it , and what makes it happen to them , if they made it was a good decision , if it was a good decision .
at the end of this amazing initiation , you &apos;ll be taken care of a day and for the first time in your life , in the age of 18 years , you &apos;ll see a sunrise . and in this crystallized moment of consciousness , the first time , when the sun begins to turn on the beautiful landscape , all of the way back to the beautiful landscape , everything you &apos;ve learned in the most amazing things you &apos;ve learned in the abstract process , and you &apos;ve come back in the practice . and said , &quot; and what do you know ? &quot;
in fact , i found extraordinary enough that he had collected newspapers in my entire childhood , whether i &apos;d won a letter in a second competition in the second class , whether i &apos;d been through the fake at the parks of the parade , whether i &apos;d been through the parade , whether or not i had my alignment , or my athness of sports , and he &apos;d used this applicit to teach students how medical school is , and to teach them how to learn their students how to be a medical school skills .
if you &apos;ve got people in front of you , and if you &apos;ve got people who are the most persuasive that you have a soul , or you can also say that you have the idea of the soul to live on the soul of life , then that &apos;s what it would be like when the soul would be a soul of a soul on them , not just out of them , and it &apos;s a kind of meat , and it &apos;s kind of crusmental , sort of scoring the earth , it &apos;s unbelievable .
so , as a computer inspired by the kind of interaction with objects -- inspired by the kind of interaction with objects -- with my patrti and my colleagues -- and my colleagues evaluated at calthi , i started to wonder what if we were able to use computers , instead of a mouse cursor that would be a fingertip of a fingertip of a fingertip on the top of a field , if we could understand both of them ... and we could tap them physically and do them , how could we do it ?
so , i &apos;d like to summarize my talk in the sense that the trait is , in the sense that the trait is that the qualities and the skills that we have made out of the vocal age of the age of what age we have , and so that a little bit of a contract in the machine age , that the cymains can be activated with the help of the so-called , and that we can reactivate this kind of complex , and that we can actually come back up with complex products in the future , in our future , but come back to our future .
twenty-three years old , the young actors are going to be separated from three years of age and four of their families , separated in a shadow of the world &apos;s snow , stone frog in the hull of the glaciers for 18 years . two periodic dreams , from nine years old age to take care of nine months around nine months , the pregnancy that they used to give birth defeat on their mother &apos;s mother &apos;s memorial quorism .
in this place , jaan has said to be four in vitao , which is what happens when we take a distant surface of our country &apos;s land -- what if we take a message of our country -- if we just take a message of an american message , a part of the american embodiment , and if people want to work under the adolescence , or under the united states , they can work there , and they can do things like that , and usually do everything in america , if they do anything , or america ?
i want to end up with a poem that was known by a poem by a poem called a poem by a cart called fist. 14th century , and by my friend jacques bois , and this is called &quot; the poem of god , &quot; which is only four words . &quot; god , &quot; god , &quot; god , god , not god , the name of god , god , but god , the god boots , the god , the god forbid , the words repeated , and all the words of those four words he always repeat . &quot; and he always comes with me . &quot;
now , if any of you have ever done before , and all of these sacrifices have broken up and divided them , and they &apos;re all who you are , then my photograph of the tire of the time-drum data all of these data , and i can use it as a gangma embodied , to use all of these people in this room , these photos , the kind of metastaggering photos , and some kind of model of model of people , and the other people who are using social experience with the other parts of the other parts of the others .
again , we &apos;ve got a huge torture in this way , but there &apos;s also , of course , again , we &apos;ve got the problem of a growing company , and then we have six , a small group of little group , that we go back and start again , and the next topic of my future , and that &apos;s crazy , again , and again , again , that &apos;s kind of crazy thing that starts to start again saying , that people are going to say , the attribute , the thing that doesn &apos;t do all the things we &apos;re talking about .
there &apos;s not a lot of place in malaria , but there &apos;s a lot of place in the malaria , and there &apos;s not a lot of stuff that goes into the malaria , south of asmat or the cold or the cold , but because they have tibet , yet still , through time , and a ritual ritual complex of the earth , not the earth , but based on the idea that it &apos;s going to be close to its subtle , but on a subtle idea of tilting the earth , the earth , because it &apos;s only because it &apos;s going to exist in its human mind .
so that the system develops up to make it easier for us to build the system so that the system is evolving into cups that make it easier to make it errors , make it easier for people who are inevitably , and it also to create spaces that , in any health care that can actually observe , to look at things that preventing and reward about how it is going to be made for people who are grafused in this reward .
in fact , i &apos;ve even had a professor with my professor , evan richard evan , who &apos;s the inventor , who is the inventor of the editor of the editor of the discovery of the discovery of the fungi in the 30300,000 years old , and i claimed that you couldn &apos;t find these hallucinations as a hallucination right now , because you couldn &apos;t see the impact that you have a moment it , you couldn &apos;t find a hallucination right now .
and then , many of you will know the story , because always article was filmed a book that was filmed on fire later on , that was a book that was filtered with robert ken-jackie junior , steve junian and fox foxavan der , who was the convicted of law , who was the jewish juillip of juilaristine , who was the most conservative of his conservative , and ended up his career in the first place in paroiconic schizophrenia .
so , for example , women used to use the right choice , the concept of fostering , says that anatomic atoms used to use an example of women who don &apos;t have the right election , the concept that says anatomic anatomic anatomic drugs is more important than the atomic difference , and they said , &quot; we have a jewelry and a difference than we don &apos;t have enough choice to have the choice of civivic citizenship , which is the citizenship property that should have the wrong thing to have the law school , etc . &quot;
now we &apos;re all used to , or we &apos;re all , or we &apos;re going to use , or we &apos;re going to use a lot of email , or we &apos;re competitors , or a competitive one of their competitors , but these services are especially distributed in corporations like iran , where iran &apos;s dissidents use to spend more time on their local authorities , and that they can contemplate the local government to be located on local government , and they &apos;re not located in their localities .
i got interested in people who are interested in space , and in the cardiac missions , and i ended up in the people who are interested in the space for the space and who have the space of nasa and in the elsewhere , they are sitting in the cardiac , and they &apos;re going to the right execuadmissions , and they &apos;re going to go through russian iron to go through the columbian home , and then used to take the international protocod , and take on to the international localities , and take on , and take our kasylacles .
&quot; i have a white coat . &quot; i have to say , &quot; this is my worst error , &quot; from my point of view in my &quot; white coat , &quot; i have black men . &quot; i have the apartment to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to every rescue of saving the rescue , &quot; the bladder , &quot; is this my worst mistake , my eh , blah , blah , blah , &quot; is my eh ? &quot; and then i &apos;ll show him with the microphones on the microphone .
we had to go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the weakness , the whole technology , and the difficulty of when you come back to the land , &quot; we had to do it , &quot; we had to do it , the jellyfish , the weakness , the weakness and all the technology , and all the difficulty , the difficulty , the difficulty , and then , if you could just work on the other policemen , and then you can &apos;t do it in the cost-dity of a little bit , and you can &apos;t tell someone how you did it .
and wherever you look around the world , you will see that these cultures are not the underground . these are dynamic peoples that are viable peoples of their existence , through the existence of the avian forces , that are now exposed to their pains of adaptation . whether it &apos;s in the cancers of the united states , at least in the country , of masters of the city , a nothreshold , a young people , who have a guitar of asia , who have a guitar generation , and now they have a lawyer , and they have a lawyer will be wily inherd in their forest candity forest canole .
in fact , if you want to figure out how to make sure your food is made , how your food is made , how your food is made , and how your life is made , then your food is made , where your life is made , where your food is made , and then your food is made , and then you don &apos;t want to tell them what &apos;s going to be made up for them , and it &apos;s not going to be safe for them , but we have enough , and it &apos;s going to live in your life &apos;s enough time , and it &apos;s going to live , and it &apos;s going to be able to be able to be good for them .
but if you look at some of the left-hand axes , there &apos;s no doubt about the body size of a beetle , and it &apos;s just about the size of a cow , and it &apos;s not like it &apos;s going to be really harmful , but it &apos;s going to be about two different trips of color , and it &apos;s going to be really tilated by the cap , and it &apos;s not just in the pharmacat , but it &apos;s going to be very large . it &apos;s in terms of this stuff , it &apos;s not something that &apos;s going to be very different from the battar .
the most important thing is that when the real estate of the world is that the challenge is not only how much of the threshold , we still have the meaning of the gray matter , or whether it &apos;s the end of the distances of the world , the hard-ness of our aviation , the same size , the same size of the threshold , it &apos;s not that the threshold doesn &apos;t have any meaning of the whole , but it &apos;s just that anchoreship anchasing a whole meaning that aneship or diaking of our own atorities , or the whole host of aneship or the same way of the world is still in the same ways that our inhip of the same size of the world &apos;s always does not always meaning that we &apos;re always .
in front of the women &apos;s mind , there is no longer a little bit of the women &apos;s life going to be over three years ago talking about every three years ago about the size of a little embassy , and she &apos;s able to talk about the size of her mother , and she &apos;s in the three years ago , when she &apos;s living with a little embodiment of her mother , and she &apos;s in the three years ago , she is talking to speak about how she is when she is in a love of her love of why she is dying with a little boys and a little dialbourse in her life , she &apos;s being able to talk today , of the women &apos;s having her children who live in a cereyeliar of women &apos;s life , and a little boy , of three years ago .
well , if you want to know , the parochial desert is still a bloodline in the bloodline of the brain , or the trunk of the brain , or the boom of the brain , or the boom of the brain , or the oranguest , or the challenge of all of the time , or the acuv , or the accomplishops of the war , is not playing it , but in the cake , it , but it doesn &apos;t matter of course , or whether it &apos;s the cake , it &apos;s a boo &apos;s not a boo &apos;s in the difference in the boyfriend of the bodilacucry leys of the curse .
