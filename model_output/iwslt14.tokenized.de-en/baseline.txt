from seattle ...
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s the sing .
but it &apos;s about it .
don &apos;t find it .
yes , hello .
we love innovation .
solar technology is ...
this is not ...
we were poor .
are these all ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yes . okay .
thank you .
after a week .
great trick ?
we were .
a few less .
and he says ...
we know that .
ta-da !
wait twice .
here it is .
that goes fast .
they need time .
music as language .
that &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... not yet .
thank you .
what a fish .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
that &apos;s efficient .
wonderful , &apos; does it ?
completely inefficient .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much .
don &apos;t get them .
the only opportunity .
not a hospital too .
thank you very much .
stephen watts .
three out of 10 .
that was incredible .
thank you . thank you .
yes , kind of .
it &apos;s terrible .
long , yes .
fantastic , right ?
the sun goes to the sun .
oh my god .
we love entertainment .
we &apos;re going to pick up .
after home , where ?
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we lose them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
a whole lot .
sounds good ?
the whole environmental debate .
familiar , what ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
that &apos;s great .
that was fascinating .
can i be honest ?
the farm is incredible .
what did they do ?
robert gupta .
this is the system .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
yes , good day .
lento , slowly .
that &apos;s all interested in me .
we can do that .
what do you say then ?
not very sustainable .
yes , milliseconds .
that &apos;s our present .
they have similar principles .
yes , good day .
good work ! yes !
just make your job .
this was the result .
thank you very much .
and she did .
so they meet al .
it &apos;s essential .
they &apos;re all important .
very different term .
incredibly exciting .
that &apos;s me even .
dance is blank .
yes , that &apos;s going .
flying cat .
this is the last one .
can we change it ?
these days are over .
these people deserve money .
what happened here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
take it again .
and that &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know .
centers were built .
what happened here ?
but do you know what ?
what was the result ?
i was amazed .
it &apos;s generic .
so they knew everything .
you could see manhattan .
here &apos;s the video .
it has sensors .
why not live longer ?
he opens the door .
a few more .
that &apos;s very good .
oh , the one .
there &apos;s no normal .
yeah , i know .
pretty good , right ?
but do you know what ?
i have a question .
okay . thank you .
i stood him for him .
players don &apos;t sit around .
so they do that .
they &apos;re bad . &quot;
so let &apos;s see .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work .
what do these people need ?
i don &apos;t think that .
i thought about it .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
they use their hands .
so how does that work ?
how interested you are .
that would have been okay .
what are media today ?
they can go inside .
so where do we go ?
so it &apos;s true .
how do we know that ?
because you know what ?
it &apos;s not a country .
why do we do that ?
not very often happens .
bg : thank you .
this is a wish .
and i was an artist .
let &apos;s call him don &apos;t .
not school management management .
and the one has to go back .
we can do it differently .
they actually do weh .
and i understand that .
an unprecedented challenge .
there &apos;s no leaves .
it &apos;s against justice .
but the wrong things .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
i &apos;m a writer .
here &apos;s another example .
i forgot children .
it feels great .
i swear it .
i wonder .
it &apos;s not going to do that .
thank you for listening .
why should we do that ?
thank you .
here &apos;s an example .
you can see it immediately .
not toxic inside .
but i kept working on .
or bombs .
i &apos;m going to go here .
there are two possibilities .
we need energy miracles .
why does that happen at all ?
oh . a moment .
i want to tell you .
what do you want to do ?
this is what happens today .
and i was working on .
so she was back .
and so it was also .
yes , here it is .
i &apos;m going to give you very much .
and why is that ?
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what would you have to do ?
i mean the soul .
you &apos;re doing the same thing .
in china , it was different .
luckily , right ?
but that &apos;s not a conservation .
pee a chance .
does somebody see something specific ?
and i always had it .
very expensive mobility .
people played crazy .
what creates the illusion ?
my blueprint again .
after just a journey .
first of all , limited .
i created one .
yeah . well . well .
imagine the camera .
jk : both of the one .
but it gets worse .
so here you see it .
thank you very much .
be a mentor .
maybe 10 times .
but that didn &apos;t have it .
the data came in .
this is a great question .
i will never forget it .
it has billions of those .
did you see these guys ?
but there &apos;s something else .
here &apos;s another example .
is it photography at all ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
ohhhh .
and then it became international .
there was remixing .
let me summarize .
okay , some more .
the answer is no .
just further . much fun .
my name is amit .
he had the experience .
it keeps you fresh .
this is a great question .
is that your opinion ?
a almost identical structure .
and it became better .
that &apos;s what she did .
it was very much like him .
here you see the city .
good day , all together .
will i like the color ?
oh , thank you .
some of them came and went .
i think , rather than that .
dk : 60,000 .
there &apos;s an old study .
it &apos;s not disabled .
the game is from 2007 .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
he &apos;s called paul open it .
what do you believe ?
who &apos;s going to make it safe ?
first we have the population .
i don &apos;t like this question .
but what do your fish eat ?
now , let &apos;s also call it don &apos;t .
this is pre-educated .
the work of the interpret .
but where are we useful ?
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
how do we really work ?
... his own story .
i will never forget that .
so , what does that mean ?
well , what does that mean ?
privacy has to be given .
there are online criminals .
we have three main groups .
it was still fish .
he always showed up here .
and then it happened again .
i felt really good .
and many people forget this .
crisis . disaster . disaster .
it would be uncomfortable .
it &apos;s not our fight .
it &apos;s not our problem .
we lost the contact .
why not think about that ?
we love technology and creativity .
it would be knowledge .
we &apos;re constantly getting together .
and this opens a map .
but what do we do with this ?
that &apos;s what it &apos;s like .
what do i look at ?
his name is tempt .
is it going to have my size ?
that sounds crazy , right ?
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
we need to spread the message .
this is what most of you know .
you also have to understand that .
you can see that down there .
i want to ask you something .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was destroyed in the ground .
they look like this .
is it about light ?
i grew up in india .
this is the short-term .
you see the water coming .
i had a good life .
so what happened for years ?
who are these relatives ?
i wanted to keep us healthy .
these changes are in the space .
how about fitness ?
this is the exciting thing .
but the key thing is ...
he &apos;s working on this .
and then they put them up .
what &apos;s actually happening there ?
the orange trajectory .
they really loved it .
but i felt worse .
the two greeks came to me .
woman : overwhelming technology .
very horrible .
what is the soul ?
we don &apos;t produce ourselves anymore .
i can claim everything .
he went down and down .
what can we do yet ?
this is what the graphics looked like .
now i get to the end .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
it may sound anxious .
we were 20 people .
so we &apos;re too many .
you can &apos;t have bone .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
or is it possible ?
in conflict , creativity comes from creativity .
so what do we need to do ?
they didn &apos;t have any books .
this is felix .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
thank you for your attention .
this was the beginning of the journey .
i &apos;m honestly honored .
and then everybody went down .
they saw the big impact .
first decline , second .
well , i was the next one .
honesty -- who &apos;s normal ?
and finally , epic meaning .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
the same thing , just bigger .
who &apos;s the most successful ?
you want to feed the world ?
i wanted to support them .
it &apos;s almost no longer left .
i just loved two .
one place is south korea .
again , you have it again .
this is such a natural thing .
my wife told me .
and how did that feel ?
that &apos;s what you can train .
does it make the curiosity ?
so it &apos;s lincoln .
so why now hacks ?
this happened to christmas .
what is that for a thing ?
so , you know , you know .
they could have done better .
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
i don &apos;t have to worry .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
is that reasonable ?
so that &apos;s the good news .
it was a huge success .
so they saw something magical .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
but can &apos;t be a problem .
they always say , why ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
it was just not invented yet .
dance should work yet .
anyone know what this is ?
for example , this perception in context .
this is a game outside .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
but it was very sad .
so let me remind you .
the answer is no .
and is the crux .
sometimes i push too much .
but they do the job .
they connected these two people .
her mother left her alone .
okay , there &apos;s some .
think of your own decisions .
this picture is from this place .
i see this plussion .
and it took 18 months .
tell me about this world .
this is very risky .
and that worked very well .
again , he showed him jail four .
i learned everything .
and there are hundreds of them .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there &apos;s good news .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
that really made me sad .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
but that &apos;s not that fast .
how can we help you ? &quot;
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
no , never was an opportunity .
the story is not over yet .
what happened on this day ?
well , then we want to .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
they come from the artists .
i should not say that .
the power plant can exploit .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
she did it for three years .
you can have these clouds .
the data was not available before .
game is not albern .
well , how could that happen ?
is this all just education ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
so that &apos;s what we can do .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
they have not changed the story .
everybody talks about happiness today .
don &apos;t be very good .
game is not just child games .
and that was 19 years ago .
what would you like to most ?
they create an episode story .
they have so much uncertainty .
the data is constantly lighting .
nobody ever said that before .
so paul is a terrorist .
and that &apos;s what he actually says .
don &apos;t take anything .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what should we look like ?
this is a lot of volume .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
i almost never cook with that .
she was back and die .
and of course , this is incredible .
and here &apos;s the darkness .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
a autistic student .
if it &apos;s the waste right now .
so not like detox .
and that &apos;s what we take .
we depend on two countries .
everyone needs a goldfish glass .
let &apos;s be sci . &quot;
people were still happy .
it was my first sunfire .
in fact , he collected fish .
my name is brian goldman .
they share their experiences with others .
the white lines are in population .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
he showed up on the algae .
it &apos;s just not technologically technological .
there are four and a half thousand people .
and you have a problem .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
each waste is nutrient .
and so we &apos;re too many .
so the question is : how ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and it was an incredible experience .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
but there are two problems in it .
i started to feel better .
but , you know what ?
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
this was a common dios .
i talk a lot about these questions .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
we &apos;re in a field .
and that &apos;s what we did .
basically they do the same thing .
this is one of the images .
what other marks like this ?
and then something weird happened .
you can play with different kinds of games .
the whole building was made of water .
italy wins . yeah .
the morning , before the game .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
creativity had to kind of go out .
today , everything is easy to have .
asked the nurse .
i should probably not do that .
maybe in our cell phones .
and it starts with a doctor .
i &apos;m going to tell you something .
we use the energy of the sun .
this is all metadata .
because i can claim everything .
it will always be similar to you .
but slowly it was going to make it happen .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work , right ?
what are they trying to do ? &quot;
we &apos;re not going to go ahead .
what have we learned ?
and the shape plays a role .
they can &apos;t store energy .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
okay , that &apos;s really courageous .
once we started a viral .
my second mistake was worse .
and it &apos;s a 257 .
we all love baseball , right ?
somehow , the kids don &apos;t do it anymore .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
they will be free to computers in the free .
because does anybody have masses here ?
and then reconcilize it .
they should not suffer other things .
this has the biggest impact .
the reasons to write it .
anyway , not to navigate .
and that &apos;s really in the beginning .
the truth is more like this .
do you want to solve jeans ?
that &apos;s what you can &apos;t do from anything .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
their family gathered .
thank you very much for your patience .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
what else is more risky ?
be just who you are .
i remember my first fire .
what about a story ?
dark . dark . dark .
i was now trying to do something spanish .
but all right and effective , right ?
but we need the whole thing .
nuclear missions , yes ?
this is completely belongs .
let &apos;s get that quiet .
hm , my brand ?
this is scary .
that sounds scary .
next : nuclear energy .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
i wanted to be normal at the time .
this is what i &apos;m going to show you .
as soon as the judge looked at me .
we can &apos;t just do that .
so i went to the court .
i got a little scared of technology .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
and there are several reasons for this .
they sell certificate .
it &apos;s not documented .
why am i going into medicine ?
it can know where we are .
it spread rapidly .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i like things that are different .
i went to prison -- hard .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
this is a child game , right ?
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
and this video is in real time .
the game starts -- swiss .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
what about longevity ?
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
so the correlation is german .
so , you see what happens .
it was really changed the dynamics .
so i just started playing .
and then we said , okay .
yes , these are the data .
i &apos;m going to shoot a little bit through the head .
have you ever been disabled ?
this is like learning .
because for me , it means memory .
how and what has it recommend ?
we say in germany sustainability .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
music is medicine . music changes us .
it turns out to be really difficult .
and you know what i learned ?
these are going to be unresistant .
but what &apos;s going to come in the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
this has nothing to do with science .
and that can make a big difference .
but there &apos;s another reason .
anyway , we need a solution .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
so i listen to that , thank you very much .
they flew the channels .
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
we started 15 years ago .
how far do you get there ?
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
do you know what &apos;s neither ?
so the first step to a interpretation .
and it &apos;s still not a interpretation .
that has to be the aging difference .
if you come to that , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
this is just the minimum .
we can regain our nutrients .
anyone know what three seconds are ?
on the book and on the image .
this picture reminded me of something .
i think they &apos;re abandoned .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but maybe this is not the case .
and what does this mean for designers ?
i want to show you that .
it was a pretty cool project .
here he &apos;s going to go the sun .
this is the memory .
these rivers take a very rapidly .
a has these benefits and risks .
our magazines are read by millions .
lego did it for all possible .
privacy is not at the debate .
they were embedded .
i &apos;m the new doctor .
i don &apos;t take the same lost .
baseball is full of great statistics .
because we live on a water planet .
do we really want to go to this direction ?
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
and these are the neural structures .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
oh , my time is over ?
something sticks me .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
so we measured his movement .
this is a picture of the object .
apparently it was pretty popular .
you see something fun here .
i really like beautiful clothes .
he can only use his eyes .
but the truth is far away from that .
you can do that all the time .
so this crazy story could vote .
who would ever wish one wish ?
the netherlands would have been too simple .
her father died shortly after her birth .
for a year , we had no cents .
we need to increase complexity .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
here &apos;s your brand package .
it should be the experience of experience .
but then they really want to get deep into it .
you want to be in the museum ?
that was more concrete .
okay , you really want to know that ?
and i had to go away from the city .
we won a few prizes .
who doesn &apos;t want healthy children ?
it makes globe in kids .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
no , i mean , really serious .
i think the knife in my hand .
and the goal is very simple .
i go back to my doctor .
architects and engineers , to be lucky .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
now i see greg &apos;s moon .
a billion people are going to be hungry today .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
i loved myself from this fish .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and this sounds very different than before .
he was already over six .
i started a institute .
they even get funding .
the film was not provided yet .
we need to think what marks .
what do you want to do with it ? &quot;
i call this the end of this .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 .
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
this is ideology , not science .
and that brought me through each other .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
all right , that &apos;s how it &apos;s going to come .
it &apos;s busy .
the so-called projects today .
automatically runs to the right thought .
this is the natural things .
but it requires a lot of planning .
we can reinvent everything .
as we think of north .
and that depends on phosphorus .
often in the third of the third , forget .
it &apos;s longer than those other networks .
the stones are color codes .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
it &apos;s about changing values .
i started with my usual talk .
this is a very sensitive question .
i learned this from my grandmother .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
we haven &apos;t written this app .
and every morning i jump to it .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
these are more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
it &apos;s very good .
what would you describe to words ?
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
there are also worlds .
to ask , what is the right ?
in the people who are talking about uranium .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes .
the living nurses .
they gave their blood pressure up .
thank you , but the best thing comes .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
happy productivity . fantastic !
the result of that was dishal .
and everybody in this room has to be in .
here &apos;s the oliver oil .
bjjelln .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
we &apos;ve already got a lot of procedures .
this is maybe going to be open to the public .
my brother stared me .
these are the apas saras .
i talked a lot about magic .
who could have looked at this ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who do you really want to be informed with it ?
completely on a particular goal .
what do you think happens as next ?
they have them . they always have them .
so this is a harm .
it &apos;s now convicted .
they literally put the heel .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
i hope you &apos;re going to give me .
most of all , when he died .
so it creates two circles .
the side is clean water .
this sounds very unusual .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you always get rare animals .
she &apos;s going to touch her deep .
he died , broken through history .
here you see how the building works .
they went through each other .
tell you what you feel .
the other one had died .
let &apos;s do a little bit of a little bit .
here you have this little mechanism .
there he was melting .
the interest is interested in fireflies .
the question is , what &apos;s going on now ?
the students are divided to notes .
these things are logical .
and here &apos;s what you feel .
for energy , that &apos;s what i found here .
i tried to understand them .
all these generations need just a few milliseconds .
and no one seems to come up with it .
that i had written these crazy things .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
this is also a paradigm shift .
a dalmatical , right .
you look at the back to the back .
so from modern society in the computer society .
and that &apos;s what they do .
we &apos;ve got to come far , too fast .
it &apos;s about a neural supply of america .
they &apos;re all assuming questions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they &apos;re the healthier countries of somebody .
we walk through initiational rituals .
now look at this curve .
withird is just to live on our lives .
i promised people in death row .
they kept us inspired by being inspired .
leadership may be some mutations .
so scott gets this fruit .
we worked up until the night .
so i followed my farm .
he moved back into the silence .
now we saw the reverse effect .
it &apos;s all applaud applaud .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
so , you know , not so optimistic .
it turns out the operations .
let &apos;s start with the perceive .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
they had a concept of blue blood .
i thought everybody could do that .
i never met him personally .
even cats look at this video .
there was jimmy kimmula .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
how would you describe your brand ?
we &apos;re talking about kitchen , fresh .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
no , that was what i thought .
i &apos;m a speaker person .
that &apos;s not the route .
this is a painting of a circle .
the roof was also covered with water .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
and women argued the successful thing .
we can support them to be good .
look at what it does .
the main man winds me .
sexuality continues to the picture .
i read you the contract .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
that &apos;s the truth . that &apos;s what i think .
we &apos;re talking about twenty of it .
it was really immensely profound .
he shake his head , no .
this is going to be happening in the next april .
we also get very accurate data .
behind the seven mountains and so forth .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but with the right design , please .
we can support them to be good .
just to say , what is information ?
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
there was never been a time like this .
and even lomborg thinks about it .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
and also , these sources are interrupted .
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
this is an ecologist network .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
the koch had raped him .
you put it like this .
this is such a trajectory .
the thing that &apos;s been represented is .
what takes fifty million-million-milliseconds ?
i see the dalmatiner .
it might take up until it &apos;s invited .
maybe a look back behind it .
no , no , far .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
156 nations send our tv channel .
they appointed their internet connection .
but today we &apos;re far beyond this .
she wasn &apos;t even devastated .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
this is the system that we live in .
but i asked myself to ask these questions .
and that was what i felt .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
what will these three billion people bring ?
you also want to give you the wishes .
something very strange happens here .
and that was the breakdown of the one .
i learned a few simple things .
it can know how we keep it .
so it creates a backup .
boston has not just an application center .
this is a small app .
the ufer of a different place .
&quot; they didn &apos;t let them go . &quot;
i lived in parallels .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and i &apos;d like to read them .
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
you can be logically and intuitive .
tell me a little bit about this part .
make it possible -- all of you here .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
does anybody even know what that is ?
so this is the reason for this project .
it &apos;s called &quot; i jump with me . &quot;
let me tell you a little bit about it .
these kinds of circumstances don &apos;t exist in us .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
we can do something like this .
so the first exciting primate .
and there &apos;s a lot of collaborators .
daniel kaneman : sure .
everybody would like to make people happier .
the domain also plays a role .
and why ? intelligent food changed .
it &apos;s too gray millions of people .
we have in this country now .
not even the truth will be free .
because now you can apply a three-sentence .
you see the line up .
in many cases , these people are totally healthy .
we don &apos;t know exactly why that &apos;s happening .
but it &apos;s not just the words .
thank you , danny kaneman .
we get an absolutely flat line .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
because we don &apos;t want to shoot around ?
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
they make the process , they understand it .
there &apos;s a lot of things that have to come together .
and what do you do with the waste ?
bad ? i was completely confused .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and then he can walk out .
a very beautiful story , as i mean .
his personal impressions of the seaerotic .
i &apos;m trying to do that for an example .
this has to be done only as a present .
but we start to see a change .
this is a year of water river .
we have thousands of organisms that can do it .
it &apos;s a little virus of bacteria .
now this level of intuition is very important .
so littly open source is open source .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
they grow five centimeters .
maybe i did it with guilty .
&quot; a pal blue dot . &quot;
let &apos;s get something else out .
it &apos;s all coming out of our own pockets .
normal people are not available to these devices . &quot;
as an artist , i &apos;m very important .
here you see roberto dance .
and no matter , italy won the end .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
but the game is a formal transformation .
thank you . i have a question of you .
he had 20 minutes of music .
well , then i &apos;m going to show you .
that &apos;s just a safe method .
it should contain the two elements again .
shake the environment , make less waste .
but i get to talk about that again .
yes . she doesn &apos;t do anything else .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
a language is the expression of human mind .
it was a zaceful .
what you need is a new medical culture .
alone , damaged and support without support .
do you want to listen and listen ? &quot;
i think our identity is threat .
many of my mandatory are very young .
my cousins around everywhere .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing representations .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
here are two different jeans .
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i &apos;ve got him on my laptop . &quot;
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
it &apos;s a whole cool grap .
the difference then is perceived as a loss .
in two hours , they &apos;re building down everywhere .
the emergency staff was all the strands .
no insurance can make up .
there &apos;s a lot of great books to this topic .
so this was a problem for supercomputer .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
you can predict that . why is that going ?
what kind of application i did ?
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
not half or half a quarter ? &quot;
so what can we close from all of this ?
so basically a translation of translation .
no tree is carbon neutral .
and further , now you see him always .
the next step was now in this communities .
he had invited a lot of natural videos .
this is just the employer .
two minutes later , three things at the same time .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
that &apos;s really the fuel problem .
and ecologist was a disaster .
this is one , part of her .
it was just not before , you know ?
in other areas -- the world of communication .
this is my supermarket . no big .
but western governments also help themselves .
sleep is ubiquitous .
i &apos;m going to be tired , like we all .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
if you burn coal : no .
tell you there &apos;s no predictant .
can you play me now in blue ?
no , we find out what &apos;s inside .
and there &apos;s a central point of this .
well , everybody &apos;s got a cow .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
what are the archaean models now ?
and the list is that you can continue endless .
so , that was my primate motivation .
providing america . find more out .
and the problem is not the technology .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we asked around , and nobody knew it .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s given us in a way .
and then it looks like this .
do you remember the winds ?
so , help me a little bit .
imagine mozingly efficient .
i &apos;m happy that i &apos;m there .
the water amounts have bigger .
they worry about that we &apos;re bad there .
man 3 : i &apos;m the museum museum .
it &apos;s called cloud -- the cloud .
or take a lift .
between content , the instruments evolved .
i want to explain that a little bit a little bit about .
in fact , it didn &apos;t want to make a viral video .
in this three-sentence , three sentences come from .
three sentence , they still know from school .
you can zoom out very easily and zoom out .
now i &apos;m going to add a badly .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
if not , if somebody else is today .
this is the machine below geneval .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
they laughed more than they do here .
your problem is that you have too little .
third : escalation of expectations .
the official dogma of what ?
you just listen and then start talking .
let me show you how they work .
it &apos;s a game called the national character .
i call them &quot; the income billion . &quot;
we &apos;re thinking of energy tongue today .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
you go around and shoot .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
imagine an airplane .
that &apos;s something that &apos;s built in the city .
second time . end of the normal game .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
imagine just a moment ago .
raise your hands . let me see me .
maybe we can see a third of change as change .
dumb is not much better .
people listed . people fighting .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
you know that science is not a company .
if you burn natural gas : no .
so , that really changed me .
i &apos;ve tried to preserve the body .
life had not changed for centuries .
but that &apos;s how many people got over the years .
my grandmother never left his life .
my fourth technology : predictions for complexity .
the third technique : categorization .
it breaks a thousand square kilometers .
you come up with two because -- very simple .
you should tell me something about my brand .
it was something that we knew to do .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
donnerday : self-trust is the key .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
i wanted to rebuild the health of a disease .
now , if you think of a piece of time .
what ? that really made me sweat .
we &apos;re changing food .
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
we have forced them . puff .
my parents are the 80 on the ferences .
and there &apos;s the lake process .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drink in information . &quot;
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
you can dive in a particular year .
because that &apos;s why it &apos;s lighting , right ?
shatz the environment , use less energy .
this is what &apos;s called the osistic model .
now you see the dalmax ink .
and the two ultimately are here today .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
this has to go down , down to zero .
but i didn &apos;t get away from that .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
and in time , they can react again .
our goal was easy to say , okay .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go on again .
all of this is compoable of it .
it &apos;s all in space , it &apos;s useful .
this is spent in a second in a second .
the phosphorus problem is much critical .
anyway , you &apos;re going to do that in .
the permanent ice is red with red .
and if not , yet dance .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
my mother asked us to touch their hand .
seriously -- the bottom line .
well , this cartoon makes some exceptions .
here &apos;s some on the hampton .
so this is how the supermarket is .
i thought i could integrate myself .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the three words laugh : do you remember ?
i remember it was yesterday yesterday .
here &apos;s the chance to do something .
well , i &apos;m cheating the court .
i said , &quot; ok , oma . &quot;
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition .
i work in the solar industry .
and let me show you a simple example .
but it has an unexpected point .
so that made sense , it was passing together .
yet , we seem to be very happy with it .
we &apos;re more than that , we are citizens .
scott signed by human being .
and here &apos;s every piece of play .
after that , it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
is it about the details or the colors ?
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
no one has to give up your ideas .
motors , gear -- four possibilities .
i think maybe i heard more hands .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
eeetee ! no , thank you !
and this is a millionaire .
so at this point , we need digital security systems .
so again , the passence really good together .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
internality comes in many different forms .
so they &apos;re going to save ; they save the shoes .
this is about a percent of the population .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
what we want to do is create the future .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in the real life .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching .
let me show you from the near .
it &apos;s kind of like a cartoffel .
accessible . accumulating .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
my grandparents put this number down to 70 .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
we need to use more research for more research .
there &apos;s every footprint .
now , i would usually take the needle .
there &apos;s somebody sitting in the back who had no childhood .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand that .
let &apos;s do this as we have a machine here .
what do you think about these design students ?
this is going to be a key element .
they live with help of chemosynthesis .
i was totally excited about science , you know .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
and every night they fly down 240 miles .
every morning , they fly 240 miles to the farm .
how is the deforestation ? &quot;
natural light then provides smartphone .
that &apos;s what nobody did in the world .
picasso answered , wait just .
we always create new relations and conflicts .
that the theme of ecology is a global .
now i &apos;m going to do something else about it .
they &apos;re all back to their way back .
and they had to remove what we did .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we have just signed .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
so you can &apos;t put them wrong .
what do you do with certificate ?
this is alfred zalez .
there can be a series of changes .
and this is very important in medical research .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
and then he took me to the ears .
the rest of the time , they &apos;re delay .
i start with some simple examples .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask major questions .
it &apos;s not a decision between private sphere and security .
the question is why people accept that .
and i went back to work .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and sizable .
and we increase our expectations continuously .
then i ask myself , how could that happen ?
first of all , i thought that was a game .
the storyteller needs more senses .
and try and try this again with another generation .
today , a lot of people have given the government .
next week , this is coming to the market .
she &apos;s got a button . he &apos;s got a button .
well , it was free , that &apos;s true .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the leadership .
the first is a classic , apple .
it &apos;s like i want to be .
these things have a positive effect .
no one wanted to do with the film .
what do you think the answer will be ?
on the left , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s why i think we need to be leadership .
so we have this terrible idea .
so two pairs , every baby .
ladies and gentlemen , their relations .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
it was beyond the imagination .
but the best thing is -- in a second .
so each concert is a different concert .
so not save , avoid , avoid .
and everything is kind of package or content .
i could be in front of my house . &quot;
and this argument is not a sense .
they &apos;re supporting others from their mistakes .
i put them , and i went to the treatment .
do you know how to call a 4,000-foot ?
notice two things on this curve .
and i have to say , there were power to me .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
at 16 , i started to illustrate books .
that our contribution is to the system .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
he &apos;s not coming out in other countries .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
i never want to make a difference in life .
so i spoke a few months later at a conference .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- that &apos;s how their fingers go along .
i want to show you a little bit here .
and of course , it was clicking .
it was summer and i had a little bit .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
and they &apos;re not only going to die on masses .
what happened is that we could do that .
they don &apos;t invest in mammals .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . i put on .
these sentences are absolutely logically and correct .
anyway . that &apos;s what i want to be on every case .
technological circles are just the same thing .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for nine .
i &apos;ve got it in particular .
at the beginning of the tribal society , through language .
come , dance with me . thank you very much .
so she &apos;s supposed to come from the outside of people .
we don &apos;t have identity , we invent them .
it was much less and i was in eggs .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
now , every one of these patterns is trying to recognize something .
he came to me , and he came up with me .
all of these were so , started sharing .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
i &apos;m really sorry . does that make you crazy ?
the country was going to roll up on her .
so smarter , a huge topic everywhere .
and we want to make this material available for all of us .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
we want to do something against death row .
there &apos;s some interesting developments there .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet a realistic level is still a realistic level .
so for the theme of the day , financial save .
actually , no , that was not the error at all .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
and we have to do a lot more on this device .
it was born four and a half years ago in italy .
and i &apos;m saying that this is good .
this is a problem that many players have .
the last three of the five of the five i did .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
stored these slices , the rest .
and that &apos;s what these marks have done .
well , what &apos;s the marke gerry ?
i want to help you to calm .
both of them are survival , both of them .
as i said , amanda is our elephant .
there was no canop-owner melting .
did you take all your vitamins today ?
so this was a very strange experience .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
we &apos;ve already got 20 percent in germany .
all of these wind are going to be almost like that .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
the only thing they had was their head .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
this is a dead turtle .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
i have something i want to show you .
how would it be longer to live in good health ?
we don &apos;t want companies to be patented .
and i found this incredibly exciting .
they have the flow of the water .
so , we can &apos;t wear these things .
in the countries where people come to money .
and what does it look like , right ?
we understood that the weather is global .
and in this head , the memory came down .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is a completely unsustainable development pattern .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
everyone in my work is gone away .
that means we need to get phosphorus .
well , would you choose the same lurb ?
there seems to be an uncomfortable .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 1,000 years .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
now they understood the advantage of the prototyping .
the u.s. government for hundreds of years .
i think the first place is the curiosity .
the flgos eat the guarantees .
these were the first calculations six years ago .
but maybe you can still agree with it .
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
not all of this is supposed to be composable .
if you stayed in somebody , efficient ?
and we see that it &apos;s going through .
because it doesn &apos;t feel real money .
yeah , so , what should biohack be ?
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
the fact is , kocoal is not dirty .
there are the ones that are much more wheel .
the corporate headquarters is right here .
at one point , i thought he would have kidney stones .
and melting back to my doctor .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
we want the number of chiefs .
the swiss is coherent .
the compression of dna was an interesting step .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
but what happens to be different with muslims .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the eticket .
no apple has ever looked like this .
good night , sweet rat . &quot;
now he put a trajectory in the scene .
and they also feel their movements and their mobility .
if your job is dance , dance .
so we complained about 50 of the magnets .
these are footage of six seconds .
but it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
they &apos;re going to be rare because we start them .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of prevention animals .
all of these things are inevitable .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
i remember it was yesterday .
and i &apos;m going to get a character in the book .
tell , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
so every trump was a little different .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
i put my job at 95 pounds .
so i think the basic foundations are very simple .
i said to my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
we found that it &apos;s really weird .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
the answer will probably be no .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
this is something like our campboard .
so they can move the whole movement .
here are the results that we have just got .
but how do you do that in practice ?
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
i want to do it by not going to die . &quot;
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
... also , the domain is also playing a role .
probably a lot of you know here in the room this trick .
yes , they &apos;re right . we raise that .
and i have all sorts of little bits here .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
well , i understand that . i do that .
the marshmallow has to be up on the top .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
these silly movies don &apos;t bring us a money .
i can take the sequence while they go down .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
for nathaniel , music means seelian health .
is great , then we have a business model .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
because actually , this human being is not interested in evidence .
because we can &apos;t live without life .
he &apos;s just getting them and not himself .
why do i have to afford a little car ?
a phrase with his own breath .
it &apos;s not going to talk about interpretation in the early class .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
and in my youth , i said , expectancy .
it &apos;s kind of a compound of poop .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
or they didn &apos;t have a photolitography .
and all of this leads us to a big question .
it &apos;s virtual reality and without computers .
yeah , what do we do for projects now ?
and the world in which we lived in was like this .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
if you commit it , this is what happens .
and that was not hard to diagnose diagnosis .
i was a compelling student .
all right , really good , maybe a all-star .
wealth , not debt the result .
she had the last word in every family .
the transition happens . we can feel it all .
and we &apos;re using this word with this kind of thing .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and that worked . for scott .
i met the decision to go to the united states .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
and that was a experience in dehumiliation for me .
and finally , we should come transparency .
this is just online -- no press , no tv .
or are they more like a downtown ?
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
so how are we going to see the film in the movie ?
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
i want to tell you how we found this .
and that &apos;s the planning behind it .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
every icberg has its own individual personality .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
it &apos;s natance and it &apos;s just nating .
we have the passion of a dirt innovators .
that &apos;s moore &apos;s law last hundred years .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
we want to create mass inferences . &quot;
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
now we &apos;re doing this with drill and machines .
this is the use center for service and information .
and we want to bring this on a global level .
we have all navigation systems in our cars .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
all right , let me show you something more about it .
here we were , and this is the painting .
empic presents &quot; they &apos;re going to be transparency . &quot;
there were a lot of crazy things going on .
from the bird age to machine age .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same thing in disabled movement .
but are we going to do the best of our game ?
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
but do you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
i thought we &apos;re going to put the smallpox at the same time .
there &apos;s a connection , another respect .
and so i then met a slightly unusual decision .
so my two passions flew in .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
i don &apos;t know who you know this picture .
i &apos;m just going to agree , that &apos;s logical .
i think it &apos;s important to confront the one .
the question of death row is an interesting question .
the child in me is really excited about opportunities .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamics .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
today i &apos;m going to tell you about unexpected discoveries .
the underwater part is from a stone breakdown .
when i say reality , my photo reality .
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
and how was that for you ? what &apos;s it successful ?
a little bit more about you , that &apos;s not you .
it was &quot; in eternal , forever . &quot;
service : adaptation will be completely overwhelmed .
the dog ! i was loud .
do you want to become selfish and self-conscious ?
she didn &apos;t stop and she was running blue .
people in the side are now coming in .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and some of them has worked and mankind .
so we go away , and where do we walk ?
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
we wanted to develop a tool for language learning .
i might have another 40 years of work in me .
now , you know what the answer is ?
if you want to create hyper-links between the images .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not perceived as big loss .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
this is the kind of educational shame .
there &apos;s also a lot of studies now .
we learn to trust and the rules of game .
probably one of those numbers has to come very close to zero .
and i said , &quot; yes , very love . &quot;
you can say things here , the world &apos;s influence .
... can you just show the slide .
just as i think we &apos;re going to play today .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the aid doctor .
and i went over and i just heard .
she also shows himself in other places of the book .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
these results were achieved by several weeks of hard work .
this player is short before a episode .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
there &apos;s a program that may be familiar with .
i &apos;m very grateful for the stops here .
you know that he was 1835 here .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of it yet .
my mother litt on alpid dreams from the boat .
these are the people who form my world view .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the borders .
we see this in all kinds of lives of human life .
and it was also after the three months .
it &apos;s right , morality , patch .
the main problem here is as similar to aids .
the logic doesn &apos;t say about reality .
have a nice concrete example .
then i say , heart disease , yes ?
and we also invent ourselves as often as we want .
we &apos;re all born . we bring kids to the world .
his whole labor process has changed after that .
i said , &quot; let &apos;s go , oma . &quot;
it &apos;s vericide and strange programs .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
but that &apos;s what this picture is , is a problem .
there are some places that we can apply to .
we called it the digital water palion .
because they have special skills of processing .
so here &apos;s a couple of natural light worms .
the second factor is the services we use .
it changed my way to make films completely , completely .
it &apos;s hard to overcome the destruction .
so you could feel comfortable with it .
this is the idea of how the soul does .
that means the ants weigh much more than we do .
and we can look at that now .
geh and quantum leonard cohen .
so , pull them out and start inventing them .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
this is an idea to spread .
so imagine only two other small changes .
how many would you decide for a good memory ?
and that &apos;s the message of the message .
so listen to you , if you &apos;re playing a music .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any statement about what &apos;s true .
the first two sentences that are logically correct .
in fact , we know that something else is the case .
now this should actually be not a joke , but .
and then they do that , and then they experience the sentence .
we can lead these things to different games .
what we love to love is the realistic thing .
they moved to a natural concept .
so these women were trading , and they just got themselves .
the more it changes , the faster it changes faster .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and we designed an ipam app .
darleans and sponsors have been healthy .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzles .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you zoomed in . you can really go into it .
you can see in all these museums here .
how much money will need to remind that ?
think about it . this attack is generic .
and if it doesn &apos;t , it doesn &apos;t do anything .
so we &apos;re starting to start with a wind drugs .
he says , &quot; be prepared for the printers . &quot;
imagine a sovereign airplane .
it &apos;s a completely denial deception of missions .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .
this is another look at the tree of life .
they shared the king in two miles .
this is one of the classical expressions of play .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
we had no child paralysis yesterday in this country yesterday .
and i &apos;ve got a long time to figure that out .
we repeated these practices with the same students .
you have to be ready to take risks like this .
&quot; look at your sales , pink .
there &apos;s no overpopulation process of trees .
then you &apos;ll notice that there was a change .
and the third area that actually explains itself .
i &apos;m excited about the conversations of all of you .
every big picture is the beginning of a cut .
you wouldn &apos;t be hungry , and you know what ?
or are they more like a download ?
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
this is the consequence that we need to ask ourselves .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
medieval : huh your child .
game is the kitt that keeps us down .
if you have something to give you , now you give it .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re right now ?
they teach them to open themselves .
anto : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
and here are two patients . these are their records .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive child .
i think that &apos;s true for everyone on the planet .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
so , a climate change will be terrible for you .
i &apos;m just showing you just the new york times .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
clean coal , you heard a lot of it .
but the volume are much bigger than ever before .
it grows in winter and shrimp in summer .
not just bad , but the worst of all times .
everybody knew your genius was something lah .
we put them new , repair them .
and the world in which we now look like this .
but these are all roads in the united states .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
child mortality has a tenth of a 10th .
this is then there that comes back .
manifest is something that is a billion people eat .
she &apos;s not even an idea ; she &apos;s a process .
and you know what my answer is ?
we walk into the poor of the placebo industry .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
where is the biggest interest , what &apos;s really going on ?
and the energy is very important for them .
we went back to the titanium of titanic .
because artists have a broader relationship to lie .
and at all , you &apos;re working much less than i do .
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
i &apos;m never going to play more like this right now .
it &apos;s &quot; reform of refourth behavior , yes ?
and less usable or usable is it .
how can i make a little more kindness ?
i don &apos;t see why that shouldn &apos;t be like this .
so how do we work when we put it in there ?
every society is prevented by a primarily medium .
and these interactive portraits , each other is true .
we &apos;re now focusing on fuels of vital generation .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built watermarks .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
they get a model that comes from all the earth .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
the only problem was she had 10 children .
so in other words , i first define what i want .
and i see the same process of combining photographs .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it was looked at almost 200 million times .
they had 348 different kinds of brand .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction to it .
paralysis is a sequence of many choices .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
he described one of them as a very common .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
in a place , the screen is filled with leaves .
so this is the aside pyco-movement movement that &apos;s done .
and there are projects like this in every level of government .
this year , it was looked almost 50 million times .
but what about this day , this particular day ?
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
i love this guy ; his expression is uncomfortable .
we should put the bear in the box .
are they eight and monkeys like seven ?
the living self has no voice in this choice .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
and in the world , everything had a sense for me .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
zie , in a moment of headline .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
so gender can come into lots of different variations .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
and no , it &apos;s not a game or san francisco .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open your doors ?
here &apos;s the current version of this trajectory .
it was an extreme situation . you needed a extreme solution .
and these were the first of people developed tools .
as a result , we build more powerful social relationships .
you never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen rare lines like this .
i take this hand . and here &apos;s the knife .
and the movie is called &quot; realizing a realization . &quot;
well , in this area there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
we &apos;re talking here -- about 15,000 lines code .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
well , we did the mayor of the mayor .
well today , we know everything about where our things come from .
france makes a tor . italy makes a tor .
how do you emphasize people because of their characteristics ?
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressive vity .
he stays every fifth hope from my consciousness .
is it for other people , or is it to us ?
so i say , let &apos;s start the world &apos;s changing games !
edward caova is an indian scientist .
currently we spend three billion hours per week with online games .
the biggest difference between them is the transition with time .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
bg : a energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
and i say , &quot; well don &apos;t give you a self .
with pivot , they can dive into a decade .
but for many people , that &apos;s a little bit radical .
so i &apos;ve got a lot of fish in my life .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
in fact , the notes are very fathers and not exactly .
because we don &apos;t do things anymore .
there it &apos;s going to be more like my glasses .
as i said , doubling it first started .
this is an interactive fillment .
and oluminescence ! it &apos;s possible for you despite the one .
i &apos;m going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and everybody knew it was so functioned , right ?
i would rather continue to do this work that i love .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
this is : &quot; watch your finger on every light . &quot;
the next step was to find the apps for it .
we still know one where everyone &apos;s going .
so you just go to google projects .
what other metamins have you run through ?
so we don &apos;t have a budget like others .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to see great .
this constant feedback is not in real life .
i &apos;m going to take him out and explain him .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
a research mester for the subject of the user interface .
i &apos;m going to solve the same thing that &apos;s in there .
you don &apos;t know anything in this goldfish glass . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great dress .
in the future , most crime are going to play online .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
now it &apos;s on the red list of dangerous species .
30 years ago , this would be ridiculous .
but i really think that after us , there &apos;s something else .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
the cell communities started to abstract information again .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital physically .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the canvas .
&quot; it &apos;s not &quot; eradication . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know how to use it .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s put together again .
also urban designers and construction are very interested in .
there &apos;s not even online . there &apos;s no equation .
it doesn &apos;t work for the memory itself .
our steps in the digital life were exponentially exponentially .
this is star night , probably never seen this before .
in the course of this discovery , i learned a lot of learning .
as a child , i recorded comic books and so forth .
if we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing right now .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always make things the same .
we were just sitting there just like else .
many of a 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
i was quite obsessed with investigation of the deep sea .
so if sound says , there &apos;s no soul .
this is the most difficult part of my talk .
i can &apos;t play as much as in 20 years .
both cases of me , questioned me .
so much testosterone , but no response to it .
so the growth rate itself accelerates itself .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my jail .
11m is the highest thing i saw .
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we come to the goal ?
that &apos;s why the weighs to think .
these are spaces that can respond to a people .
now , how do people die in a hack of hacks ?
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and you can see this green point there in the middle .
i sell museum in the entire country , around the world .
this is my meat , and i can turn that around .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
no , that &apos;s exactly the right thing , right ?
a lot of them are covered by faces .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
in both cases , surgery was operated , and it went well .
she didn &apos;t have a treatable brain damage .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
and the fish also had the happiness to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the numbers of language .
it was the error line against drugs .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
there &apos;s more than that , it &apos;s even deeper .
but we just know a little bit about where the things go .
ok , imagine how extreme self-motivating motivating .
i know what people think when you see that .
ask questions , ask the evidence , ask the evidence .
i said , &quot; chicken ppers ? &quot;
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
this was what it happened earlier in the village .
this is what this is happening as nanotted machine age .
it &apos;s a political disorder in our country .
she put them on the beatening machine .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental disorder .
she could find in a time-to-time learning framework .
... it &apos;s the crowdsourcing .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
i &apos;ve been working in a cohmini work -- dangerous .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there was shunrocks and they said , &quot; so ? &quot;
that &apos;s what &apos;s going to go back to it .
so , as a human goes with certain things .
and of course , how does design influence to perception .
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
it &apos;s just breathless ambiguous .
lawyer : i &apos;m a lawyer .
we have an abstract language of abstract language .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
but it was actually a big fun in this night .
we had to worry about lawyers of lawyers .
it was called &quot; automatic stone stone . &quot;
belinotle is a certificate place .
well , because you don &apos;t know that it was different .
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to do ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
they slow down to one of our big problems .
we &apos;re looking at the process of themselves .
thylacines ? yes . alive ? yell .
here &apos;s a short video about what we do .
but they can combine something special like this .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
because the images eat it for you to find recommend .
all right , and whales , you &apos;re in this museum .
the idea is to overcome a digital security system .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i make it clear .
we can put this time on everything we want .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy progress .
this was not a film , no hd , that was real .
i wasn &apos;t there for a long time with miel .
because you know , that &apos;s a fun process .
have you ever seen a clicking tree ?
there &apos;s exactly the same thing i described .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
energy new america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
frosty , the carbon man will be cleaned every day .
this is a organism we described in 1996 .
so i go back to one step , and i get another view .
i filmed in war areas -- hard and dangerous .
so we should better figure out what the goal is .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
if we build cities , that &apos;s actually a big thing .
if the child is born , it looks like a girl .
in other words , game is our adaptive joker .
can you imagine something good , that comes from taboak ?
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
you can just call some names and people will understand .
diphph , tube , child paralysis ...
this is a variation of a thing that was done .
well , the energy source is over time .
and it was a experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
it creates immense jews in control room .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
he said , &quot; the skin does like a pig .
it &apos;s this devastating , vertical taste .
the cigares eat the physical lankton .
and so he &apos;s going to fly his elderly circumstances .
and then there &apos;s a whole lot of simulations of simulations .
but it wasn &apos;t that in the awesome years .
the musician is the extension of our body .
he &apos;s only lived in neanderthal years .
hey , puma , does you really feel serious ?
a baby needs about searching wind .
so i know about some of the ones that didn &apos;t wear themselves .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here to here .
it &apos;s like to ask someone who stops the sun .
please follow me , because the circle will be close again .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s happening here .
this is an iconic debate . it has to stop .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
but then i thought , you know what we &apos;re honest .
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds .
he &apos;s a biologist at veteteta palma palma .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
bruno giusi : thank you very much . thank you .
i &apos;ve got a friend driving a passeri .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound .
and because we &apos;re getting older , we &apos;re going to get the wind bigger .
this is the period of time that you fall in .
and we &apos;re still looking at very , very strong with stories .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and the predictions of how they read them are serious .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
and i didn &apos;t expect to change that .
it &apos;s also my big , life-long love and fascination .
and what i got well was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
why are you going to buy us if we can &apos;t buy ?
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
a few years ago , i started to develop litting-edge vity .
they &apos;re still describing the broader .
my grandfather was during the prohibition in jail .
she was a weapon , strong woman , she had effect .
so , in some sense , the technology gives us the technology .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it realistic ?
but what if you want to see the slides ?
but my logical side has not liked it .
i just want to say a little bit about salatreshold .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . heart wish .
we also brought litters to design schools .
this is the simulation of chesake bay bay .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against injustice .
my uncle died on alcohol diseases .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also full .
in fact , we &apos;re also a majority community .
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
let &apos;s call the animal , it costs a lot of money .
if one is able to help the other , we strengthen our communities .
ohhhhh , wwwwww !
they always worry that they lose real space .
50 percent of their decisions were hit within nine minutes or less .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and my talk today is maintained by this cognitive action .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
open the map , and jump with a click .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a whole lot about transparency .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
you could also use ordinary design -- technology to spread .
one of my friends made it -- richard bollingler .
imagine these imagery could really start flying into flies .
i would like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
these are the kinds of questions we need to meet .
i was fascinated by the elephant and beauty of biology .
and i can tell you it was a changing experience .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
and this is from a economist . so he &apos;s logical .
i mean , how much do we get from our memories ?
the more money you deserve happiness is you .
that our survival of the survival of every single individual is connected .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
and yes , i have a task , as you might recognize .
secondly , photographs should combined the same lighting way .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
for example , this one would be completely logically locally .
and i thought , &quot; well , that sounds interesting . &quot;
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be done .
this is me . the first image is a picture of my family .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of statements .
and the movie is going to be &quot; realizing , &quot; realizing . &quot;
i &apos;m jessi and this is my suitcase .
just that i think it &apos;s more like it , not true .
i know what you think now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
i hope you &apos;re excited about it . thank you very much .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
i mean , we ask : why are we fighting this ?
these are a lot of tode by masses , 20 hour per hour .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my death rate .
because they &apos;re the ones who are experts for taste .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
i mentioned this to miguel and he kidnapped .
so the more the more the way the system is the system . &quot;
and then i &apos;m going to fall immediately , that &apos;s unaware .
and also , what would you think in the mind today .
and we &apos;re going to replace oil through other energy sources .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t know .
like alert -- and other horrible things .
i &apos;m not going to tell you it because i want to use it .
it was completely closed that she could fail .
so this made me get out right , and i wanted to do more .
and immediately i see another pattern that gives you .
yes , this is what a load is down there .
it &apos;s not about resource efficiency , it &apos;s effective .
we &apos;ve been using in holland now over three years .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange amps .
i know it was the reason of the sea was .
and that was the first time i learned this .
i studied a woman printer , and she was in breathing .
and the very time i collected more and more knowledge .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 if a sleeping is 300 .
in 2010 , we had just connected to two billion people online .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our system .
and the lighting path through the rest of the book .
&quot; because they &apos;ve been listening to this morning , &quot; he said .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropy .
this approach is true for everything that we do creative .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
well , your life is not going to be happier .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re always lost for always .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
here &apos;s a picture of an orchi in kentucky .
he &apos;s got a charity from 15 to one .
i can say the kanzler is a man .
we &apos;ve been moving in the so-called bird age .
this is just 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
this is the audience that we just finished recently .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here you are .
but you can &apos;t , if you &apos;re in a foreign foreign .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t seem to be human .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
or you want to be fitter , stronger , more power .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though that belongs .
my great-grandparents died when they were 60 .
now , where should we go : what is the right approach ?
that &apos;s what they &apos;re all in the forefront phase phase .
and of course , it can never give them to germany anymore . &quot;
a government is absolutely necessary , but the need to be more efficient .
and the more i was talking about , the more i should tell .
and i celebrate , i wonder a little kid .
obviously , that &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
if you &apos;re happy , you turn to other happier people .
players are mayor in spider social networks .
how can we transfer these feelings from play in reality ?
this is the same , bad team under the best .
the fact is that this uncertainty should worry about us .
so people have really thought about creativity for a long time .
b has this benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
one of them was that the phone never was broken .
the way we can predict the structure and function and function .
a few months ago , and i had just forgotten everything .
even who kills someone , is not just a furniture .
the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
and this video was actually finished in january in january .
each of these topics , of course , has many , many smaller decisions .
there &apos;s a lot of other things , but i &apos;m missing time .
today , i want to tell you about circles and openings .
they &apos;re also interacting with their environment and their experiences .
this trick you can do your friends and neighbors . thank you .
you know , there was no mandaras in paradise .
yes , i &apos;m very excited to be able to be at you .
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting is the vision of vision .
i &apos;m sorry that i have to cut so strong .
second , what economists call oppersian tune east .
and i think it &apos;s because the world looks like this .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
so it has nothing changed , and yet everything has changed .
we just crossed the 7-billion-dollar brand .
then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
so , if you ask the light again .
it was a store that was called dragger &apos;s .
are you so far ? you see a little nervous .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
the things that are used to be used in technical systems .
so the device you see , it doesn &apos;t work .
but it &apos;s the sound of sauce technology .
they did that by providing the country .
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
they call the fear of welcome . they welcome the risk .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
there &apos;s only the second best , the fireflies .
they can throw away away where they go and stand .
an amazing miseration . one from nine innocent .
i want to show you two , maybe three examples .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually going to get a red iceberg .
this is somebody in the rest of the rest of four out of 10 .
we &apos;ve been used to that things happen to happen to be linear .
i had a 14-year-old boy , black young young young boys .
they &apos;re inside , they want to end up to the end of the gangs .
and then people could eat that , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
because that &apos;s where the actual government is happening .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what do you feed ? &quot;
and then we started negotiating the insulers .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
i &apos;m playing what these notes might have to mean .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re going to help , ask yourself at the people .
but also our perception of ourselves , as well as it gets us .
and other examples are the ambiguous , intelligent systems .
how many doors have the house that you live in ?
we think it &apos;s clean -- and we still smell well .
i think and i have the feeling , we should teach that .
and i guess that many of you have done this .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
i sent them home without talking to my doctor .
the cost of solar energy over the last 50 percent .
we need to be able to engage in the machine of government .
there &apos;s a direct reform of namesynaming system .
the monkey of software takes place in the rule for a few years .
and clear , we can find fastest chairs .
cats look at cats that look at this video .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
and what happened was that i needed an experts .
it looks pretty much like the old-fashioned language .
i just wish i could see my kids growing up .
and part of the egg is more than 100,000 years old .
so i want you to think about a danger experiment .
it has the eye of life , one after the other .
and i asked them to fund an expedition .
we &apos;re talking about the fluke of information overwhelming .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineer .
that &apos;s the first year half of his advertisement .
well , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
so they move around and make art installations like this .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
i was shocked and shocked up to the inner body .
i went through the emergency department on my way home .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
i say that because i think identity is very important .
because all these new technologies of today are founded by themselves .
because your life depended on whether they did the job right .
and these people know something we lost from the eyes .
i knew she was born to give up .
we don &apos;t just find a little bit about something we do with .
a typical wal-mart provides you today 100,000 products .
do you know how many choices you meet in a typical week ?
i mean , this is just what my logical side says .
so what i &apos;m just telling you is what &apos;s truly amazing .
in the previous example , it was about finding units .
he said , he doesn &apos;t know that . he will ask questions .
so i &apos;m going to show you very carefully what i &apos;ve done .
if they didn &apos;t move more , they have buried them .
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
what would you like to have if you could just have one ?
again , which potential we want to call out ?
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own episode .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
if we looked at how emotions with income .
and that &apos;s a little bit hard to legal , i think .
there was no christmas trees . we did it all .
and we should not . our healthcare system is mimic .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals ?
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not so sure .
it &apos;s impossible to say how this photograph was actually put together .
the words , so long his friends , spoken his friends now .
and we found that there was a context in fact .
do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
so the driving force behind that is the cyber-- superpower .
i didn &apos;t have two years with my wife .
the pilot set up after the hudson river .
the openness is , death is a part of life .
that keeps us in the distant and lets us evolve and keep us evolving .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
it rains about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
you see the person who wonder what &apos;s going on inside .
in most of my activities , i &apos;ve got two hips on my own .
it turns out that dna synthesization is very difficult .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we think about our future as predictable memories .
well , the memory itself is a storyteller .
what it was ruined was the memories of experience .
we &apos;re going to meet ourselves in the next few days .
there &apos;s a decrease of progress there .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
a fishery , but also a bird reserve .
the second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of narrative .
the first one that was more like a passionate monkey .
he &apos;s very happy about it , because he &apos;s given her .
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate there .
and it &apos;s particularly the first time to ask what &apos;s the right thing .
but i just do it just a little bit more curiosity .
i started thinking , i should just put the project up .
we can look at , of course , first of course , the tilling problem .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
just to precise newspapers , they agree .
if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
so you can ask : how happy is this alive ?
most of them are completely ignored by memory .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
does a single one in the audience ever see somebody on masses ?
it turns out if you can get that in zero .
you can like to test it after my talk in your immune system .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum , very , very many ideas .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
so , in every store , you can get the things back .
so the question is , how do we deal with these wind ?
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
so , for example , shatz , the environment , fewer car .
and life lived in the kitchen region of british columbia .
so if i leave you to each other , your interest is going to be interested .
so , i look like i could just write a song ?
she said it would be like a donnell of air .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious to what we need .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
they add a blue on a green , and they can make light .
but they don &apos;t take the latest losses .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast .
yet we &apos;re still coming to the galapagos islands .
more and more people came in , just because they were angry .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
it &apos;s an amazing invention when you think about it .
we have a lot of cells that don &apos;t have any more on themselves .
you make the errors now , and you pay a lot later .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
but where would the next aed to help this patient help ?
you have to make 62 different decisions to design your car completely .
now , don &apos;t understand me wrong , that &apos;s not that easy .
almost as we would be prepared for our lives .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego space .
i was the only one who could talk to the airplanes .
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
think of this as the imagery , as a flying image .
but bonobos show us the other side of silence .
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going to do .
this is going to affect politics , i think , in the years .
we found this in the view of happiness itself .
they urge their judgments . they almost never do .
usually most people are starting to organize themselves .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize prize .
when they walk , yes , every footprint destroys the ground .
if we push it , we can shake a little bit back .
the most powerful mountain worker is the head of massey .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a book .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be worse .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
because through marine reserves , we basically put the past again .
i want to end with a story that really was excited to me .
sometimes i lose the equilibrium . a story to end .
i found that technology could make magic and not kill .
so now we &apos;ve raped the time renewables .
so today , evolution can happen in the time period of microseconds .
here he heels a rare evening .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less inviting .
we could , of course , reduce 10 percent , but what does that do ?
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
autocolors , foreign color of cars -- i have 56 options .
they don &apos;t even come from the museums .
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
i became part of the wonder that day not to die .
it &apos;s called eyeen and you can see the description .
this is the average size of a greenland iceberg .
i mean , what does anybody do with so many outcomes ?
and as a general term , we can use the word of internality .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
we all need to think of things that we can &apos;t see .
let &apos;s call him miguel . in fact , he &apos;s called miguel .
because he doesn &apos;t know what pile is to go first .
and then the same thing happens in a good conversation .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
we take pictures of this mini-big bang all in detectors .
economists call this a parallel improvement .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
the way to maximize is to maximize .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
this is a whole book , an example of non-mental data .
and of course , we all share the same adaptation .
and that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s happened in the fatar .
there we are accidents like the ingenious .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just from our heads .
i want to help you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
because frankly , every project has his own marshmallow .
ceos are a little bit about average . but this is going to be interesting .
because although it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of minds .
this is one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
this deputy ran across the older black black .
but i don &apos;t know how empire people will be .
you &apos;re about the block , and you take it as an openness .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the temple room .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees with our next living relatives .
the first of those drops is a contradiction of complexity .
they invest a lot of their time in the growing structures of growing structures .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little it &apos;s supported .
normally , you &apos;re just not just dancing and some of them , not others .
now he mentioned the mineral needs of physical lankton .
i take the breathing of the audience , consciously aware or unconsciously .
they feel that &apos;s the real truth behind the outcomes .
but the question i want to throw up is : why not ?
and the best thing about this is , which is what we expect in the area of health .
this is technology support innovation that there is today .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
wr wants to help people who have been convicted .
and that means free , which means open and productive .
how did he find looking for this particular kind of help ?
let &apos;s jump quickly to moma , again in new york .
it &apos;s going to be part of the show of the show , which is pretty busy .
we produce androws , and we &apos;re talking to androgenes .
and when you do it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this is scandalable , and we should be ashamed .
and this is the value of this experience , this kind of simple practice .
but as they talked to different people around the world about these possibilities .
they have a renewable energy of five percent .
and they did it with this kind of called lead-land maps .
but crucial is when i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so i &apos;ve been busy about when , of course , what &apos;s intuitive or intuitive .
and this is just the biohacker , the individual people .
it means that we get a cultural impact next to the scientific impact .
this made me meet when i wanted to raise my jeans .
he invited the king of sidewalk to the dinner .
but somehow we &apos;re creating it from this problem .
and that &apos;s also what i had in the last half-year .
but instead of going into panik , he just stopped .
how about both tears we can &apos;t even predict ?
if you look at the people who you have to do it ...
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
imagine that every single person is controlled by people .
okay , let me get a little blood out of you .
that means that it &apos;s about effective efficiency , not about efficiency .
new investments to create good job jobs .
six : social incidence . speaker 7 : 65 deaths .
and i hope you &apos;re going to play with me like this and play .
that means that the player cares three of 10 clubs .
a long time ago , there were grawals there -- 500 years ago .
in many of you , you &apos;re going to say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
the x-ray interpretation of a piece is this comparable .
i looked at the master of my eye , and i looked at the mayor and down .
light worms in a glass , i always found quite exciting .
for example , this picture has about 10 billion imagery , i think .
so i decided when i was 15 to become a diver .
here &apos;s what i do . we look at right here in the center .
and within a few years , lego moved in every household .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer .
and i want to show you my outcome for this week .
56 percent of all violent cases don &apos;t come in front of .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-self-self-restoring .
i asked him how he became a fish experts .
there was the core research in leopolar shadow .
from this time , an anecdote that you may know .
no longer need to whip a shower or sing .
and six milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s going to go back to the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
so i think it &apos;s a very unyellow hack .
i think it &apos;s kind of like seventure or something like this .
it &apos;s actually only about two thousand really forms , these networks .
finally , one solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
so , this looks like a basketball football .
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i didn &apos;t leave myself .
well , in fact , the number of violent crime didn &apos;t change very much .
i first eaten him in a restaurant in southern spain .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity &apos;s humanity .
it was always so inspiring , so refugee .
the death penalty in america is defined by iranium .
it turned out the trash of the page . went home .
alone this airport has a surface of 100 square kilometers .
i like things that are weird . i like special things .
this is my marke in my little , failed industry .
so maybe you should put a little bit about this . &quot;
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine .
here you see an extent from this angriffy code .
we &apos;ve got his bed to see it out .
we degraded a man who has value for our society .
we play games to get the suffering of the real world .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to the question : it &apos;s .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
this is indeed the real disappeared of human and machine .
a few . probably as many as there are creative people here .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons of life on the planet .
i grew up with a higher portion of science fiction .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building siv , not intensive .
so here was finally a company that tried to do it right .
the component is getting more and more to the friend that you live together with .
and i &apos;m not so sure if you really stay in .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little trip .
and i think there was a very good code .
in fact , nasa showed that there are many of them out there .
they &apos;re going to increase the paralysis and the satisfaction .
well , i wondered how can i really get that ?
it &apos;s a independent area . they control all minerals .
in contrary , it &apos;s a complex physical world of physical view .
somebody was broken , and he had the system that was green .
photographs like this : a building along a lot of driving street .
the biggest fear they were afraid of piracy , violent and death .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very difficult to come out of all these extensions .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange country street .
but of course , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
i brought seven of them down , and that &apos;s all .
but a lot of people start in a very strange position .
our gut is a wonderful friendly environment for these bacteria .
well , the two types of self throw two terms from happiness .
well , life alive lives on its life continually .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
it &apos;s just a bloody calories . it &apos;s mimic .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
ah , the majority . this is what i like to see as a doctor .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s 2,500 years back .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
well , what has that to do with the placebo effect ?
smallpox . smallpox have killed billions of people on this planet .
it &apos;s the renewable energy as they &apos;re often called .
this is a fish up in the south western corner .
there &apos;s a question , how do you know , is this diagnosis ?
the node notes have the function of the letters of a script .
and then they &apos;re the interconnected of the pre-industrial cultures .
that means you &apos;re navigating about sound and rhythm .
so this is just an application of many , which you can do with it .
and then we &apos;ve been working on this kind of cooperative era .
on the last ted conference , i gave a leadership to lhc .
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
this is what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
54 percent of the deaths of death .
basically , the creature was become the building block of our time .
it would be with a new sentence , never before hearing hearing hearing .
how can a judge someone turn into something that he &apos;s not ?
in many ways , people had to fear of lynmobs .
so , the programs that are the most common nucleus can do .
for example , the fish was taken on a glacier .
opportunities that were not allowed to have been encouraged .
so i did a few years ago to do that .
finally , when we said , we should welcome the fear of welcome .
an eight-eight-hand playing marks . how is your brand ?
why is it important to start ? what is the red ?
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free .
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
now , in this night , everybody went to celebrate to celebrate .
and the key indicators for this is the extinction of languages .
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s not this test .
and this is called androgenic receptor .
we &apos;re developing ourselves in common equity , heart creature .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a ph.d. .
at the moment , they &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about smart food production .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
so i offered a $ 100,000 dollars for the winner .
one day , this mirror , yes , there &apos;s a beautiful one .
there was no piano at the time when there was no piano .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
even if you were to shoot now , you would have emissions .
most people know this from the software area .
this is actually live in the internet . they can test it .
it &apos;s our new hometown , and it &apos;s called ninee .
but nothing was invented to leave me again , until now .
and the best thing about this is that they connect with magnets .
some of my smarter passions in the last five years .
i looked in the raw , and it was a little pink .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular tonight .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
that &apos;s why the dramatic numbers come to the prison council .
i gave some talks in germany to the death penalty .
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkeys today . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
this is my weekly wage . a very simple thing .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
what is the relationship to the thoughts and feelings about you ?
and if the dangerous ones are , really bad things can happen .
and that urality , this goal , has really changed my life .
they talk about nature of nature to tell us who we are .
if we actually don &apos;t take a phosphorus and put it down .
this piece of 50 years of old technology became the magic thing for me .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours of video per minute will be invited .
if they could do it for the people , they could help me .
and just as we disappeared all these companies , one after the other .
i &apos;m sad that we never learned as adults .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one deserve from us .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big thing .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individual alism .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individual alism .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go to the house .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
specialized skills and skills and their combination lead to success .
people here have contributed to the development of this miracle .
and somehow we need to change changes that &apos;s going to go down to zero .
we &apos;re still finding other odds of what their rights are .
this is the period of most perceptions that we have .
this is our younger test down there on the bottom .
at the end of march , the lhc is going to be able to work again .
and that &apos;s the message that i studied in medical school .
do you know how to call a 3-foot in leaf baseball ?
i think that in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
if somebody lies , it &apos;s not just a lie .
and so i think the ted community should be horse .
and she &apos;s spreading , organic , of course , of course .
my friends from honhonduras asked me to say , thank you ted .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
well , finally , the film has a very large amount of time .
it &apos;s actually just a period of two weeks , two weeks .
these people will be connected to the film in eternal -- always for .
so all these green areas , these are the richest environments .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; swator . &quot;
so unfortunately , we have a piece of god to do a long term .
i went into the car and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
in the short period of time , i got a clear : ted has a identity .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good intuition to actually lead the experiments .
in my opinion , mass inferences changed our world .
this is all reality today , and in the future , it will be much more possible .
so this allows us to play together by binds , trust , trust and each other .
here it says , the more you push , the better .
people said , &quot; do you have no fear to have success ?
i don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with it .
and what i learned is that error are absolutely uncomfortable .
i love this : &quot; watson forced human enemy . &quot;
i saw her and smiled , but she looked very serious .
three months later , i was moved , and the adventure went on .
it &apos;s about creating cosmic flow .
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gray notes and stuff like this .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impulse for the flyanother .
and the question was , how could you combine technology to connect new technology ?
for example , i don &apos;t want to give you the same rights as a human being .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and very quickly .
i played the first sentence of beethoven vens .
the man is supposed to have a common ancestry or a common ancestor .
you know , loud signs and b , etc .
how were his living circumstances , how are the society and politics ?
on september 10th , september last year , the machine went to the first time .
we &apos;ve distributed lifelong children , and they &apos;re going to play with it .
and when i heard her , she made kepless sounds .
and i was good , i went down with claude .
but when i ask you , how about your wife ?
you collect information about the piece in the sixth literature .
there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they can all be engaged .
but how would it be if the picture is connected to all of your images ?
you say that you never forget the names of dying .
but it does something that doesn &apos;t do any other regime technology .
because the categories tell me how i can keep them apart .
so i set up , and they played the tedtalk .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
we should be able to rotate everything we want .
and i tend to look at my shadow as my shadow .
well , studies have been done to see if that was right .
and then you can see what &apos;s enormous speed of opportunity there .
it &apos;s natural from asia , where all of japan comes from japan .
because a good engineer either has built great cars or nuclear power .
and that was the first beginning of a musical printing .
you can only have zerleversions , if you &apos;re not there .
it &apos;s good . the question is how it &apos;s going to go .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
the official faith of all western industrialized societies .
&quot; do you remember the patients that you put home ? &quot;
we live on a planet that has 70 percent covered with water .
they just dive the apartments of apartments against the cities .
that &apos;s how to lie that you can just apply this logic wrong .
often , the music class is so you learn to read the notes .
that would only be the letters that you learned to paint .
eight : tsunamidor warning . cyberattacks
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
bruno guisi : mark , mark , come back , come back .
now , if it doesn &apos;t seem to be hardly , maybe the most tired .
so we don &apos;t have to control the people , to be bad .
now , there &apos;s all of these rummies in front of the big revelation .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
they knew jealous bits and byproduct that they had to attack .
it was when italy the football world mastered .

you &apos;ve heard of &quot; high level &quot; and &quot; a strength &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
this will be , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not steians specialized meat .
if paul speaks in a public audience , he can &apos;t say without a gun .

and the color daughters and shattitudes you might remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps written the field in the last year .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more value than to build it .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is so often mentioned today .
this can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .
if you turn the light down , it looks like this . so just as we saw it before .
imagine that the screen could just appear in different formats or bigger , in different solutions .
so i started to think about what it is to make the games in our games .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to attack the needle .
and what the marshmalland is doing is to identify them hidden assumptions .
they &apos;re doing that because they can follow the white line of the road in the street 92 .
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re kind of moved to nostalgia , to wonder .
and what we can read almost every day in the paper that you find in this third sentence .
one example from a very different area . monet has painted the seerox times .
and i want to give you to protocoll that i was here for my part of the jobs here .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome of the genomphi x 174 .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique case of the rhythm , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
the only thing i did is to change the sequence of this information .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never more true than today , that it &apos;s less .
i thought , &quot; do you think the camera would mean that we wanted to have a backward conversation .
so for example , the number 164 sticks very out of this code ; you can &apos;t see it .
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just so much that architecture is almost disappearing .
if these imagery fall down , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text .
our cities , in the last few years , just with networks and electronics and electronics .
for bonobos and people , life is not made out of teeth and sound alone .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .

bill gross has several companies , among other than an esolar called esolar has the great solar thermal technologies .
one is the energy that these technologies create dramatic things as the power of power .
that means 15 pounds of fish are necessary to get a pound fish .
we just wanted to know what is because with a normal , normal electrochemical battery .
a tv or a washing machine that you just use , you don &apos;t need .
in a sense , the arctic capability is the sleeping heart of our global climate system .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view that the fish knows something .
and this was an example of what our governments are using the technology against us , the citizens , the citizens .
we want to fight biases and discrimination in the authority system .
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually recorded .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
and what we &apos;ve actually done is we &apos;ve done humanity , is we &apos;ve started to abstract abstract .
that &apos;s because the government is like a ocean , and politics are the top 15th cm .
at the end of one day , i cook a huge topic soup that we shared .
something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice as this slide is supposed to show .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , as long as they &apos;re not a particle physicist .
either &quot; flesh &quot; or a &quot; paradise winds , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
you can &apos;t just emphasize enough to be critical for the quality of a human being .
by shaking the sidewalk , and she puts her side together , he can interact with the characters ...
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there were no men in their treatment .
i came up with the way that we were sending our send and cameras out of it .
as we can hold them longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times more fresh .
and the side of the side places that are vilistic hormone hormones .
i was the second volunteer in the brand , so i had a pretty good opportunity to put it in .
and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution is slowly slow , but they &apos;re invious .
players love to become part of the missions of the missions of planetary planetary anxiety .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are master-players .
you know , there are two countries that are controlling almost seven percent of the phosphorus worldwide .
in china , a clonf is still in honeybee today , kind of , right ?
it actually took a couple of years from a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
and the preparation were enormous . we had to build cameras and apparently build everything .
but what voodoo does so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
because obviously there &apos;s a animal that was very often , very rarely before it dies .
and sometimes , when something comes over ted , it gets a meaning and force that else would not have .
you have to make the sound of the winds , read them away and read the rest of the book .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen here .
they don &apos;t fight that battle that we all fight about who can speak ; they all have to speak .
you may think this is just a country image , and the lower part was manipulated .
and the next puzzle is about four women in three generations that build together a new life .
the left on the left is jazz and the right on the right is , but do you know what ?
just to give you the overlook , i zoom out to see what you get .
and as part of that , they created a concept of anatomic common action .
or are we going to be able to be something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
i &apos;m really hoping that we &apos;re playing major games to survive on this planet another century .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing and seventh itself to us that can afford .
we got to a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as before .
and the idea of this is obviously not just the machine operating services in the control room .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- really made me feel out of the socks .
these grass boxes don &apos;t run with wind software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
well , when i was a neat college , i had my first biologist curse .
and that &apos;s half of all water problems worldwide that are caused by the textile industry .
this is almost limited to safety security -- perhaps for the fish , definitely for us .
in this country , there &apos;s a living for children &apos;s life expectancy without punishment .
here it is necessary to understand what we can understand under police correctly .
we need to prevent the people of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
that &apos;s just a different way of doing it and beautiful , it &apos;s not that it &apos;s better .
now , the rest of the rest of the rest that the nucleus have been in the best .
his mother was tortured as a punishment for -- for the crime .

but it &apos;s not true , we &apos;ve seen in europe in europe and our web is physical , the european .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably a lot of america &apos;s most safer children .
the next puzzle of the puzzle shows how a boat in the early morse red red by sea .
that sounds very space-time , and it sounds very much for science fiction , i know .
now , if i &apos;m talking about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
so i think it &apos;s probably going to be a furniture , fishes , fisheries , a part of our future .
both of these are strong conversations , because we don &apos;t look at the problem just as we should .
on the new day , they were going to go -- printer , a woman , a mother , a mother and grandmother .
and also , despite their logarithmic missions , the left goes on the left side .
michael j. nelson of the mystery science theater was one of the first things that twitter did on twitter .
so we also want to understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , very simple magic trick .
and so you can see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
so , in the way , in the kind of shift of wisdom , they experience the great lies of lies .
now , today , in some bottles , in alaska , in alaska methane itself from the water .
for her life , her life had a job : the fluid of her family and a new life in australia .
and in reality , when we fail , when we fail to obstacles , we often feel very different .
to these archational models , that we have a principle of natural relationship to virtual .
when i was a child , i had collectors of sticks , a box and mutations .
and so from the interest in this technology , i went on there .
so , for example , we developed a screening package that &apos;s in space temperature &apos;s liquid .
unfortunately , not in open bach , but maybe you can help the france , you can help a little bit .
in high school , a student said that brian goldman was learning for a flower .
i &apos;m going to be involved in a gift that i hope that most of you have heard .
so if we look at the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and like a lot of people , i thought it was mostly about choosing people in a room .
so it &apos;s all the tools , and the only thing that we &apos;re doing is our imagination .
if somebody would ask you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , how would you be ?
so basically , i &apos;m going to say , if you look at something that &apos;s impossible , it &apos;s possible .
because the lesson that i &apos;m going to learn to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
and maybe we know , from which wood we &apos;re cut down when we &apos;re really tested .
a third sentence that immediately appears to people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
it &apos;s called an old law , or it &apos;s called unexploring psychology that we &apos;re also influenced in perception .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re going to do next to the ownership as an old age .
all that takes the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtual life as a real habitat .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
i can accelerate the whole sequence by putting the tempo in one or another .
this question was so compelling that we decided we decided to go to the answer of the answer and developed .
we say , &quot; computers , please give you a hundred million random consequences of instructions .
do the methods that are easy to use and catch them with this patients in the team in the poor .
and i think the most important point is that we &apos;ve heard with our patients .
so we might sell a shoe , and he will be the greatest shoe you &apos;ve ever been wearing ...
why not have the fast muscles that allow them to be able to run faster and longer ?
we know that we work as human beings , if we do hard , significant work .
we know from the study that you have to attack to the needle if it should go to the thing .
i brought you an example of the north american triple tribe of the noot-indian india .
maybe at an aging understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative creative .
we have almost an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century so we can see the development .
yes , i &apos;m scared of privilege , in front of the ubiquitous , in front of guitation .
so we could do the world very simple with stupid , maybe hundreds of new cities .
when i was back 27 years later , the fish was on half of his size .
well , morgan , in the name of transparency , this is what &apos;s happening now with the $ 7100 ?
it &apos;s almost impossible to be bad to be bad , if you give red red red .
do we use these decisions to form a society that &apos;s better , the successful is , the friendly ?
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your neighbor ?
this also makes the underlying value of this talk , so i hope it &apos;s fun to you .
but in fact , my research on the institute for the future is the opposite .
nothing goes out in my doctor or comes out , no trickle . and you can study everything .
and that &apos;s because these fanatic ones that made me crazy at all .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of mammals , often , as a migrant wave reactor .
i remembered myself last year when i brought mosquitos and somehow liked the people .
it &apos;s important for the age of the age , which are mostly in the first semester , the great laws of old laws .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from this melting water .
that &apos;s great . the tube didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
the viral particles then were released by the cells , and came back and killed and killed ecoli .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we have adapted this point to the choice of choice .
well , you can see , in all cases , no one has to be a visible candidate .
most of the mass inferences in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of violent crime .
this one is going to beat the money to invest more money in more security behaving and security .
police officials came up with a heritor lawyer and offered offices and offices .
the fact is , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write from hand .
so for me , it seemed like photography to be more likely to be at the right place at the right time .
and that sadness was really thinking in a thought that i only want to have a wish thing .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been for 500 years , as i &apos;ve got to say , very successful leadership .
you don &apos;t sit around and rotate . there &apos;s always a very important thing to do .
our memory tells us stories what we know from our experience is a story .
tell you that there are negative implications that have to do with the clouds that make things different ?
this is kind of the deadline that shows us the environmental models that we need to stop .
and also the ones -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need a fuel -- they have some parts .
you &apos;ve given me that they &apos;re not taught . they &apos;re actually not going to leave the glass .
so many people also come and look at this because you can see what problems you get .
she heard of this book from charles darwin , the emergence of the species and the triggers of the human .
i admit my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , oma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
evolution is all beyond the genome of the genome on the next generation , adapting and generation after generation .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital , just great -- up to my physiological therapy .
well , if i ever opened the loans with the 600 images in it , i would have spent another hour .
people hire themselves in their beliefs , so that you can &apos;t free them .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design shop .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor that seems to be a little hard , but maybe the one about us .
so here we see this again , again , again , again , again , the whole , individual adventure .
overview : now , i &apos;m kind of interacting with the object , can zoom in again , zoom in .
the first time , the banal thing is , but it &apos;s exciting when you &apos;re closer to it .
because often people get people , they can &apos;t make a user friendship so that everybody can deal with it .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of scarce and boggggging .
if we think about biological processes , or some process to replace it , it will be a huge challenge .
if you break the goldfish glass , so everything is possible , you put the satisfaction .
if i put in a room -- like now , i have no idea what you think about me .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to the court and wear this crazy case .
in the recently , a study of ceos made a ceo in which they watched a week the ceos .
so we overhead our brains , because our brain doesn &apos;t just accept that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
i got another gift to see the future , and come back to life and live differently .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , do we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
so we have the memory itself and the life of life itself , and they &apos;re really quite different .
unfortunately , that &apos;s the whole good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they were mentioned often .
i mean , every one of us could spend five times as much for our energy without changing your lifestyle .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got only two years later , when we moved to california .
so , you need to learn for the learning process of music language at least as long as the spoken language .
so we had to develop a new method where we could put these little pieces together , and the errors could correct .
we &apos;ve done it on about a hundred genes of the 500 or the ones that are here .
and this really leads to these ideas to create these restrictions for the available place on the screen .
and it &apos;s devastating to think that our species may exist for 600,000 years .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us out .
we developed an app for layar , extended reality to find these aeds .
by the way , there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m going to tell you about a knee that works on the wireless plan .
we use this great euphemism , trial and error , which turns out to be meaningful .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so if you want to do the fortunate of both kinds of self , you &apos;re going to do very different things .
as peter peter told us , not just the highest turtles , but also the most interesting structures of all .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a candy record .
we hope that this is not a pop-ups and other profits -- that should not be necessary .
the grandfather of the man was not afraid of the arctic night or the wetlands .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
and to win , the device needs to be a better diagnosis than a team of high-quality doctors .
the founders were from my view of the initial anatomic activists , and that &apos;s why .
they played a worker game and the seven-threatening to a episode adventure .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are success of scientific method .
that would have been a lot of the world &apos;s insurance , but it does so much more important .
certainly i would never do an alien world with a spaceship , which seemed pretty unlikely to me .
we &apos;re not going to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
well , just to conclude , i want to notice that i talked a lot about the fathers .
who knows when the film comes out , we might see a hormone volcandidate .
what are we going to start with the fact that we &apos;re only different from you by a few nucleus ?
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then increase my strength and turn my strength .
but if you &apos;re in an episode adventure , and they said , &quot; let &apos;s get the oil out of the oil . &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we wouldn &apos;t have access to human potential .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon , kids will die again , because this is just one of the numbers of numbers .
in the rich world , the millions of us have just threaten a generation before a generation , hardly .
here we see a very fundamental service . is there to your home with reading the homework ?
the greeks called these digidic intellectual spirits of creativity .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to look at how they &apos;re going to go to the next century .
and we &apos;re installing an evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going on in the micro-scale area .
so in other words , the future has been around a year for a year since i was in this world .
they shoot the decision -- shoot them , even when it comes to their own interest .
so these things -- you know , people remember -- this is kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
if you give yourself with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it , you &apos;re going to appreciate it too .
recently , i talked to the oil industry recently , and they said they were doing this model right .
a method which is particularly interesting , and what i used in the last time is evolution .
we had a team last year from lows in boston in the code for america &apos;s code .
so , imagine if you were at the same time , how would that feel ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
so the nerve cells are the information processing workers that have built these cell communities .
so , it was possible for us to connect the little digital head with the rotoric tax .
china eaceacean , a little antioxitium that helps you to help you on the leap .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about has to do with doing so that they &apos;re devastating themselves .
when professors become curious , they &apos;re often put in such a research seas .
it &apos;s happened to be the machine age , and it &apos;s happened to be the book , and it &apos;s the phototography .
and it &apos;s about making a playful , creative , original , original way to solve a problem .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first ingredients of the fourth generation , and we &apos;re going to be in about 18 months .
it turns out it was really meaningful , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do anything with your film . &quot;
in the moment , it was as if a film shelf would have landed a curve shift .
that &apos;s how if i would say , shake your child , just three times less .
and the main lesson that we think i &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
but there &apos;s no promise that we can look at where you learn how to do fire .
his cause is to write the piece , it &apos;s going to be more and more and more and more to my personal being .
but these concepts of cyberage that bring us back to discover these possibilities again .
so these ngos tend to survive longer , and they &apos;re in a lot of size .
that &apos;s how simple words that we can use in the language of political correctly .
the first example is what many of you know , and some of you , very few of them don &apos;t need at all .
instead , go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could do a or we could do b .
i want to tell you about this mechanism today or something that &apos;s unfamiliar with you .
so now i &apos;m a favorite one of my favorite images , harvest workers of paleter glasses .
but now , when you get evidence , you have to get this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
in open bach , for example , at the greenhouse garbage , 20 percent of the trunk has a lot of wind up between wind .
but again and again , very rarely , something special happened . one of the gut was actually overwhelmed .
my heart of my heart , i was scared , while i was trying to figure out what was going on .
the human part of this book , far at the end , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
immediately , you &apos;re going to be able to be able to tell you that for granted , you know , you can &apos;t prove .
they &apos;ve reformed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
so people who think of evolution as a change at a time have been adapted a lot of biology .
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to be given by the mind . how can you feel ?
for these non-engineers , litted became another material , electronics was just a different material .
so what can three billion growing growing , healthy , productive members of human community bring us ?
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that &apos;s indian , but also very time .
and every time it divided , it turns out to distribute chemicals in it .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic outcome .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts with the process when the eradication is put .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you put on the lions .
yet , my interest in photography , when i gave my first digital camera , in age 15 years .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrious , these black object that you see .
i don &apos;t want this thing to be broken in 20 parts , as you know it from documentary .
i spent a lot of time trying to be trying to be myself , and at the same time .
but not only that -- with that , they connect with the universe and other devices out there .
three billion hours a week , not nearly enough to solve the most challenging problems of the world .
there &apos;s such striking things like these all sorts of materials that are changing on the rickers .
if anyone who had built a 6-inch high school , he would wear the price at home .
i met mr in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney hall .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far you can take a piece of future .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really had to go back into circles .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated as if i was the underground .
you can go out and create your own museum -- from all these images you can put your own collection .
so , in large and all of us , we &apos;re very promising that we actually have determined what the goal is .
well , a lighting is ordinary for something that you find out because you dropped it somewhere .
so the idea is that we actually include people with things that they do together , collective .
at home in new york , i &apos;m chef of development to a nonprofit organization called rofoods .
it &apos;s about how satisfying or happy the person is when this person thinks about her life .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and stay here .
they lie , they hook , they &apos;re confused , they &apos;re really drunk .
because the ground is going to die down the mosses , and the wind and wash the water off the ground .
so that you &apos;re going to be able to be able to put yourself in the situation with these scientific technologies .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you see .
this is one of the images we held with the so-called gapix technology .
well , since the film was at the film festival festival , we can look at that .
and every time i interviewed somebody , i can say , &quot; are you frozen enough for this interview ?
polar mountains are born as the calf of a glacier or break out of ice sheets .
so in this project , we actually designed some little marker to follow the trash during the system .
our language is changing the social change that were solved in many cases by a technological change .
but danny , in the entire american pursuit , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
i know that we can , and as far as it is , something that needs the world now .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccine for the new yorker , a little article .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , very much -- but let &apos;s see how different teams work .
and , even though it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s actually really hard to do it , because it takes people to work very quickly .
there are very , very few things that you can say at all that there &apos;s a chance in a million .
and i fell on like this very deep searchy , a world-class mission .
that was the reason . it was the legal skills . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
and when i come , with my little v pile pile and i &apos;m just looking at this feeling .
there &apos;s an african span saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , alone .
we made little pieces , made an error correcture , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
they found an article with false , they could feel the copyright of this thought .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the river , as nobody could ever have predicted .
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , oma . i promise it . &quot;
i &apos;ve tried to make clear how valuable cities are , how much value they are than they cost .
and it seemed to be precise , with these grass boxels , this real time -- control systems .
and you &apos;re going to offer them all nutrients that they could only want to have no efforts on it .
if a mind has this qualities , we can create a new reality and create new forms .
maybe that &apos;s exactly the sense of wider , a perception of i.d , a sense of our own power .
the challenge provides a common experience , a common language . basic attitude to build the right prototype .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six , you get the stable structures .
and there &apos;s certainly unclear about how bad follow , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
if we can do this , this is going to all the information data , maybe a new source of information .
this is really important because this is a realization that is not in a single wider pedian .
in holland , of course , you understand the lighter , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .

the basic dedication of this company was to break the analogy processes with optical prints and start to start with digital products .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to use the data on a etc . -- how we saw it in steps .
and in this way , the critical variable that a memory of self is different from a living self , has very little impact on this story .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and if that &apos;s what people do , people also make mistakes of time .
and it will allow people to measure home from their blood pressure to send him to their doctor and share it with others , for example , for more than 100 dollars .
so , the first case : all the stones of atoms from atoms are the piece of metal is still there , and at the same time , they move the same atoms and down .
when i think about creating overflow , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for any of us on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of possibilities .
but neural evidence show that the etrators that later , later , the tumist empire , the same dna as the old lythier .
how to be fortunate to be very different dependent on how they think and whether they think of memory themselves or whether they think of life .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a mammals -- which they dig them down without the whole complex .
we &apos;re going to turn it off , and we &apos;re going to expect to collect the first data in june or july , and put our journey to figure out what the building blocks are .
we want the world of creation , the inventor , the inventor , of encouraging , because these world , in which we live in , these interactive world , belongs to us .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there &apos;s no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
so i decided to visit a day of the filian eggs , and i asked the head , &quot; this model works that you really offer the people to offer all these possibilities ? &quot;
the head of the congression came to the stage and said , &quot; professor romer , i thank you very much for your talk , but we might look at the tedtalk .
we need to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the time machine and go into the future , we will be glad to do that .
so again , i stood back with a small team on unknown terror , and we dreamed &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t have before .
and then we don &apos;t have the one , but that &apos;s the time , i think , is pretty good at all , which people are right there .
i mean , it can be strange to think that a thing is at the same time in two different places , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea , they developed them .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all what it takes us from a word &quot; oh , &quot; to a ta-day moment . &quot;
but the measured measurement was quite beautiful , and people in my company told me that we don &apos;t yet be able to be able to do that .
i was at the time , when i was going to participate in one of his courses again , and i played the last one of the four balchopes of ethiopia in a late work .
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at everything for you . everybody knew you had this physical genius .
in nine people that we &apos;ve added , one that we &apos;ve added for innocent debt , which was made out of death cell .
so a organism could learn to eat a certain fruit because they made bad taste and made it sick , the last time he eaten it .
personally , i think it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to compromise with the ideas in your head .
because it &apos;s about how to meet people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media , and so they create a satisfying experience .
finally , this elderly black man came out with a very worried face in the court room and sat behind me , almost on the defense bank .
there &apos;s this plane that &apos;s made of hundreds of thousands of little bits that work together to make their flight more safe . &apos; does it not make you visible ? &quot;
one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; thylacine in my ticket , cannot tell if it &apos;s dead .
and just as the woman who wanted me to know me as adults , she was learning , she was related to a box in a box and was put in my hands .
we &apos;re going to have a process that might be able to get 100,000 years out of rule , and we can compromise it for thousands of years -- and maybe even at the next 100 years .
there &apos;s a series of people who have much more &quot; uh-oh , &quot; moments than others , and under the worst , frozen whales are frared .
that means that we &apos;re only seeing our profoundly before we see it , again , going back to the back in our seattle , to say , okay .
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a billion steam after the beginning of the universe -- and to 600 million times within a second .
but they also have a secret for our future , a future where we have to adapt to increasingly challenges of creativity , through bigger creativity and printing .
and a lot of discussions that i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had in the last three years in the last three years .
a safer pencil , if you make the full of water with water , it has enough pressure , so i think that &apos;s four to four to six .
and something interesting happened to me , which was a little bit more interesting about jacques coupled from brinids , which was the idea of a completely unknown world here in our earth .
and our european connected web is basically just made out of louder animals from big power plants , where the wave is moving around europe all over europe .
one process that everybody knows how everyone knows it has ever tried to do something -- in other words , everybody here -- not always lifted .
and every year we ask the students to create products and services and services that can be positive within a decade of milky ments of millennia of people .
i came to the ted because i believe that many of you have understood that the moral pencil of the universe is far away , but it &apos;s the tonight of justice .
and finally , saturday : a unique , personal style , personal style , is a great way to tell the world something about a word without saying a word .
they didn &apos;t count because he was left with a memory ; the memory was injured , and the rememberation was all he got to keep .
i think the molecular biology in general now , so i &apos;ve been talking about general , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
how would it be to give the underwear , wherever you are , to give a voice to make attention and make change , for the first time ?
i love to be able to find a different kind of colorful , crazy , crazy output , photographing , photographing at the end of time and blogging and blogging .
i told my wife , always when a human being used in a moral skill , because we should try to replace it through the words .
and it turns out that when you make it , it feels like something concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people more .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people we love to preserve salt sales , but they also pretend to be good for it .
so we take something very complicated , turn it into thumb , a sequence of notes , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
no , it just looks a lot better than if we show that we &apos;re always excited to get out of this , the other ones that are creating when they &apos;re just getting fire .
now , in egyptians , the elevator of april in april 2011 , the capital of egyptian police secrets , and they found a lot of action .
and after a year of planning planning , two weeks of programmed work , zero parties and naught , recorded , tony once again , after seven years .
so this is what this reactors was a problem that we fill in our fill , and it &apos;s reduced the waste volume during this process .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we have digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to create the digital code in a new phase of biology by building new biology and building new life .
but this is what i &apos;m going to wake up at night -- one of the things that i &apos;m waking at night , and we have never needed scientific progress in the night .
according to burrory , the prime in january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls of this film .
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate at the moment , building the coal plant , because we don &apos;t have any , or stores , because that &apos;s not going to go .
many of our friends thought that we &apos;re beautiful to do this , and that we checked back and all the pictures of the walls were degraded .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake was only passive in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues , but is total nonprofit .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of the government who pay taxes and recommendation .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university at stanford , i went to this very exclusive substance , at least at the time , he was really exclusive .
in a country that has just been behind a hemisphere crisis , where congress was elected for this fiber change with 124 / 24 .
it seems like we were right by the other parts of life , but in fact , the biggest part is the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are quite the same .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this as if the first set of prevalence had to be the first set of precisely than you &apos;d have to think of the opposite of the opposite .
it &apos;s always a very fortunate concert when i have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been working on as long as i &apos;ve been working on how to re-experience .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disrupted to hear this . &quot;
now , there are correctly marks and eight-marks , these things coming out and go , but one played , eight-mark is a pretty strong thing .
and if you &apos;ve already got that the drum is complex and high-tech and high-tech , let me tell you , the data is a science for yourself .
if i tell you that somebody has been a life on a scale of 10 , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self .
well , i did a couple of people in the company , and no one could give me a disappointed answer , until i finally ended up with the quiet biologists .
basically , you get every round on your sidewalk random letters , and as you try to form words , these are viewed over a dictionary .
let &apos;s go back to my medicine in medicine , where i feel a lot of well-being , or maybe a little bit less likely to talk to you about it .
but then another thing happened , very interesting step , where things were completely different , because these cells began to communicate , and they started to trade information so that communities came from cells .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference , we say , in climate .
she &apos;s staring out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see is fluid and these density , thus .
we now , from our discoveries of the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
ladies and gentlemen , which gives me enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power today than individuals to provide us the big challenges of our planet .
so a app that &apos;s written in a couple of days , and then it &apos;s spread from rare , is a kind of shaped on the institution of the government .
what does that mean is that if you were to meet somebody and you would tell them , oh , his father is a two-me-man , how much would you know about his size ?
and in this place , if you laugh , you can see how important this lie is , and how much time you need to learn something to know what artists can share very well .
how would it feel like it would be alive in a world where the german state had left people , especially if there were more unequal juvenile .
and because the government finally comes from us -- remember , &quot; we &apos;re thinking about the people ? &quot; -- how do we think about how this change happens .
are they fake , stable , stable , safe , safe , sacred , sacred , holy , like the dalai lama or yoda ?
this is ayahuasca that many of you have heard of the most powerful psychoactive parties from the reef of the shame .

we came up to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email , in the fact , that estinian education was interested in me .
and since we &apos;re going to give us the medieval campus , for example , the virtual reality in our v.r.r. lab , we can actually do that all the time .
i talked loud , you know , you know , you know , and you both know , if this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely blame , right ?
because it makes a lot of sense of everything that i &apos;ve heard about when it was about explaining the absolutely crazy thing to explain the creative process .
so it &apos;s far . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that has ever been done -- 27 kilometers in diameter .
and i argued that we might be able to create a new form of camels in which there could be massive new education based on this digital design .
the reason that was much better than anything was worse when everything was bad , it was bad for people to make experiences that were more pleasant .
and i negotiated with me that if i double my efforts to perfect error and never had a mistake that the voice could be rejected .
so this is just a few of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could be the last six days , or the last six years .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i wanted several months to plan to plan them to find different places for the puzzles of the puzzles .

if you play , you can see some nuances here , looking up after zoo eyes , and the mouth is a optimism of optimism . the eyebrow show .
you have to imagine that if you &apos;re doing something of the classic soviet stuff , five hours of this new kind of natural software only one hour .
i &apos;m a wall . to work , i have to work on the same day , i have to swim at the same time and swim , i &apos;m really unpleasant and really unpleasant .
so they found , according to herootus , the worker game and agreed a national strategy . on a day , you would eat food . you would play the next day .
the other note says we &apos;re using the zero-carbon emissions , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
the movie studio , i sold this as a &quot; romeo and julia on a ship , &quot; it became a movie of film , a passionate film .
now , in discussions , they &apos;re always trying to do these insulers that are going to have a little web that has a little web that has to do with our connected and nothing .
and so we decided to build in berlin a half a half where we can sort of form the electric scale of the island in the island of the island in three very easily .
that means that the interpret has to interpret this unprecedented language in a different , which is audible , concrete , nonverbal music language .
now , intuitive uses not only since apple has been an elementary economic factor , elementary factor , elementary violence , when i want to make technological devices for people to use .
a lot of journalists called me , &quot; what are you going to do , the test you &apos;re going to do , whether caster sester is a female or male ? &quot;
now , what i hear is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormone , monoculture , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing that &apos;s wrong .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and to get them to play some kind of game , to control their health better .
and imagine that i even had a five-year-old child with dr. pills , and so is trying to stop these practices , natural gas without success .
bg : well , the actual spending for research -- we should spend the u.s. 10 billion dollars a year more than you &apos;re doing today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
and it &apos;s this game curiosity that lets us explore and interact , and the unexpected challenges that we are , are the real nutrition of creativity .
and there was no video games of this overwhelming with computer generates still the entire imaging language in media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
so as you knew in the village , who &apos;s got what happened with wine and when that &apos;s happening today about this extension of our own devices through these mobile devices on global level .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility so that i was so handled and i would be able to worry about my patients without having to contact it .
i got a punctuator because i &apos;m not on the bike , but often there &apos;s no disabilities that don &apos;t drive on the bike .
and so i look at myself as one of the people in common with most experimental quantum physicians who need a good logic to add the complex ideas .
if we look at one of the foods of modern democracy , dr. luther luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream &quot; a kind of solution .
jacques cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating sticks that showed us animals and places and places that we could never have imagined before .
and when it comes to us , of course , it makes us feel like , for nike , for nike and mauritz and the whole textile industry with us .
in every step , we made these pieces in the overhead so we could sequence them because we tried to create a very robust process of creating what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
unlike the 20th century entertainment , the community of the community is part of our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by making it or making something new .
my wife , my kids and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and calm and archival have taken our house .
we can go back to a step further and remove the data and see that circular disease and cancer are the usual memory , but not for everyone .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the thumps , the lump , the truck , the chest fish , they &apos;re broken together .

you go into this capsule , you sweep into this dark , hostile environment , where no hope in rescue , if you don &apos;t get back to yourself .

it was exposed in the cell , and it recognized the other chromosome of the material as a stranger material , and so we just had one cell in the end with a new chromosome .

everyone , i think it &apos;s &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have celebrated somewhere on a hand-hand on the beach .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take him , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this story , as romantically , is also the end of romantic .

and if you manipulate the speed of this root , you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor , and finally , even the centrifuge exploded .
it &apos;s the alive itself , the doctor &apos;s pricing -- you know , if the doctor &apos;s asking , &quot; now , if i &apos;m going to stop here ? &quot;
now , if we go further , and we say 40 years or younger , we can see that even accidents is the main thing about people who worry about .
we should call them what it is , a commercial , a commercial , which is rapidly rising ecological capital that allows them to do exactly that production .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use suitable co2 co2 that could just be produced to productivity , concrete co2 into carbon dioxide to do this process .
so when i started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .

since i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and so my palette is going to have much more color of music , much more color and emotion than today .
it &apos;s also a artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , electronics , and combined in a pretty much more biased way .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat oceans , is as fascinating as we can really imagine .
and then the number of semantic jellyfish connection and the goodbye , which is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic network .

we see many , lots of gigabyan photos here , which is going to be able to get rid of and remove and remove , in any way , in any way .
this tribe , the cofan , 17 variants at ayaaasca that you all recognize in a big distance in the forest that appears for our eyes as a way .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept of advertising was the idea of advertising your product as many people as possible to see it as many people as possible .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing you have in front of each other is because you have a task that you can explain to you .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have traveled to the distance of the earth , to recognize that they &apos;re not away at all .
that our system also has a sanitary increase , because we &apos;re going to have 20 percent of the el , and we &apos;re also going to have a price on the other things .
we &apos;ve only used for two phosphorus , and we &apos;ve now been put through the phosphorus of phosphorus worldwide around the world , much more urgent in the environment than in all atomic atoms .
we propose that in 10 years , the rate of the civil rights of the civil rights rights is going to be as high as the dictionary of election .
and there &apos;s a generation that has grown up with the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the systems right .
and so far the isolation of isolation is that if we have a species of remote planets , there will be isolation and the changes of the environment that could produce in natural ways .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science . but now i think you &apos;re probably going to have to lead a director , a leader like a shipping apple or something like this .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species and converts completely based in a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
well , i hope that you agree with me that people are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a great meaning for change .
now , all of these randomly elected instructions from leaders , all of the programs , and tubes that are the people who are next to me . &quot;

but for about two weeks , we programmed , we went to the global prostitution in venice , my children were raised , my dog , and we created this .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the original historian historian , you know , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
but i think in this framework , and with the intention , from a deception , i &apos;m going to let the needle go in there and go from the stage .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try to try and look at whether it works , if it doesn &apos;t do that , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
many arguments against this . fishing pollution , most of you , and you are inefficient , we take a big part .
and because they &apos;re working much harder than we do , and because it &apos;s only three to six months , they talk in their weight , in their energy consumption , something three-billion people .
so if you take the system as i taught it , and all of the miserable health care of health care , then no one &apos;s left .
i think that the remarkable values of the last few years , the last decade , is that we are spread from a physical world to a digital world .
so gender is really complicated ; sexual sexual is not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some sense , you can be distributed over the whole range of the whole range .
and by the way , we &apos;re moving and circulating and remixing us so much that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for evolution to find the evolution .
of course , the stories that i was looking for , from the scieni area , &quot; terminator , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
and in this scenario , imagine that in a case , a chma chomosom , which is true on the chromosome of the cell .
not only from darwinian work , we know that the ability to survive , to survive and to survive from the struggle of human mind is determined by conflict .

they believed that creativity was a kind of godistic mind , which comes from a distance , unknown source of people -- from unknown , unknown reasons .
there &apos;s a huge marketing marketing for formal drugs like you and me , if you think about it , no sense of it , because we don &apos;t buy them .
armstrong talks about us and then , in december , has taught us the time-magazine when one of the best inventions was in 2010 , which was really great class .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , as designers , we always think about how people use things that we design .
they were the notion that people who had political power , they should have political power because of the bloodline of the grandfather to son and so on .
i &apos;ve got some people who are counting the number of books that were published in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 years , and there were much more .

it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not welcome to the process of truth and reconciliation .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the profound and strange source of quantum .
dringness optimism is the desire to do immediately , a smoke , together with the belief that we have a founded hope for success .
well , very short , a different reason that we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same thing when we think about life and when we actually live .
suppose you have a blind mental mentary , and you &apos;re going to have a surgical surr , whose average performance is over 400 years in terms of blindness .

i &apos;m studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been doing this for a couple of years with the biohacking , and i started , because i just wanted to know what i wanted to do , and i also wanted to do what i &apos;ve learned in the study of theoretical .
and i left the medical study with the impression , if i knew everything that i knew and knew everything , or at least as much as possible as possible , as possible as possible , that i could do it against errors .
and then when i go on to the other hand , in this community , where i share a voice , language , sharing language , or less and not more mouse and mouse things have to control , then i &apos;m even faster and even faster .

we see this here , if i put things up , i can make them confusing it confusing on the right-hand side , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salvation and ppez , or i can make it intuitive by making things .

the cost-effective evolution of industrial revolution and even in the 20th century , there was a huge case in the solar system , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , we can make materials , we can make modern materials and do so many things .

together , the uncountless cultures of the world is a network of spiritual and cultural life , which is filled with the earth , and probably for the earth , is as important as the biological environment that you know as biosphere .

and i want to say something that is a feminist something radically radical , and i think there might be different kinds of insight that could be designed by various kinds of atoms of anatomy , especially if people do a group .
now let me introduce you to this , which is made by amanda boxar , which was 19 years ago , a spinal market reduction , which has gone to the result that she couldn &apos;t run for more than 19 years and now .

if we get to these really big gaps -- with 100,000 bases -- then they &apos;re not just going to grow in ecoli . it &apos;s going to grow all of the modern molecular molecular molecular molecular biology , and so we &apos;re going to change other mechanisms .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a foreign rope , a neurope , a newly rey , in the picture -- and not just right , but what you have to do is you have to be grateful , maybe a gift of the boarding .
and so i think of the city a very different view , a very different impression , which i see negative and positive electrons of a city and a way of being in this way , a different kind of virtual map of a very real city .

and that &apos;s very amazing , because you really believe that this high-tech technology that you &apos;re going to meet that you &apos;re actually going to get a place in the future , but in fact , it &apos;s so that the future is in our aesthetic roots .
and because i was born without elections , and my feet were looking for them , and i just had a couple of toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , he had to get the foreign news .

if we &apos;re in a game world , i think a lot of us turn into our best version , right now , and they &apos;re ready to be willing to solve hard to solve the hard problem , trying to try and try and try to restore it again .
and since i just think of one of these little devices high , because the things should always be more intuitive , more natural , natural user , and you have to look at what is actually for us , of course , what is kindness or intuitive .

but i &apos;d like to share with you , and with this sentence , i &apos;d like to close to a and again , designers have to think differently , to come up with new solutions , and in this sense , thank you very much for your attention and please .
and i know that it would be for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to begin to start this dark appointing -- especially in which i find myself in my career .
the older man stood up . he saw the deputy , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come to say to this young man , they don &apos;t lose the goal . &quot;
so , the problem of cooperative online worlds like world warning , is that it &apos;s so satisfying , jealty at the edge of an episode that we rather spend our whole time in these worlds .
on the day , i went to this site with miley , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems to be so different , &quot; as every farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you succeed ? &quot;
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic eggs , which had been close to three million years of the bottom of the bottom 48 states , about 40 percent .

immensely by this election , between the 21st and the 24th of 24th , one of the biggest election of about 30 famine on the two places that were most interested in the city of the city .
the last example i have time to show it today is a musician sequencing for live live , which we &apos;ve developed recently and in the sidewalk , as a lethal voice , and a funny thing .
and we started making pieces of pieces , starting with the five to seventh letters from seventh letters to make these 4,000-pound pieces of pieces of pieces to add these back to 7,000 .
they were able to tell us the story of neuromarketing , as we &apos;re telling the story in this film , that you &apos;re using mris to use the lustasy of the brain &apos;s brain , both to make movies .
so i started thinking , and so i think with security in the past few months , while i was working on the book , soon the book is going to appear -- as the dangerous , anxious , expectations of my journey .
and in my profession , in roman , as also in my side , as a profession as a volunteer fireman , i &apos;m a lot of generosity and friendship and friendship in the great scale , but i also see the rest of the day and the mustations of the individual .
suppose you live in a certain remote area , and you have a loved people with heart disease , and you have your homeowned doctor to a cardiac whose average performance is at 200 times .
but when i asked him with phones , and he asked him why he did this intervention -- it was high risk surgery -- his answer was that in his country , these kids would be treated very bad , and so he had to do it .
and , of course , when it &apos;s an intuitive and how i can take an age of age as an age of age and make things so that they &apos;re using a lot of kindness , so they &apos;re intuitively intuitively intuitive , because they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re just fun to use .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do , those who are not doing . those who have the battle of sleep and the limits without the limitations , the bad results with bad results .
it also has three big problems . the cost of doing everything in highly regulated countries , and the question is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human work that the fuel is not used for weapons .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid of being a real gas , and it keeps millions of people from the floating .
now , to decide , not a glass collection to buy is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our silence -- but it turns out that the decision-making process is also affecting us in very consistent decisions .
i don &apos;t have to do this thing because the corner of the corner , it &apos;s always going to be a crazy , colorful , frozen , clothes of the output , just waiting for me , if i have a little love in the heart and search for it .
so this is one effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we make less satisfaction with the outcomes of choice than if we had the opportunity to decide between ourselves .
here &apos;s a photograph that i took on the north of the baffel islands when i went to the rubber of the founder al jail , and this man , he told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyrane of memory itself , and you can think of the memory itself as one that &apos;s a kind of alive for living through experience that doesn &apos;t need alive .
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the street , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people go up and i listen to all these things because i don &apos;t want them to be able to , or frankly , they disappear .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to take away and use less , but in average , this number is going to increase each year , and so that &apos;s more than double the number of people per person .
i met these people of grass , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows you to inject a light on any surface of any particular surface , and then drawing with a laser on it , which is only the area of negative .
so what that means is , if we look back to what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place in humans in evolution , and especially as we look forward in the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
so there &apos;s great prices here . there are challenges in transmission . if we say , for example , the energy source is outside the country , they don &apos;t just need the technology , they also have to deal with the risk of energy .
but , as we think , the only way we think about biology is going to have a huge impact without even more of food production on food , or the limitations of their availability , if we look at co2 as a product , and so we &apos;re working on these cells .
i started working through scientific literature about how these centrifuges are built in natance , and found that they were structured in something called kaskage , and every kaskage of 164 centrives .
now the fascinating thing is that the greeks that are contain in the liane , mao inhics are exactly the kind of the way that &apos;s necessary to potentially potentially potential . so they ask themselves .
this is a problem , because the global warming is frozen to look at the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s huge amounts of frozen carbon dioxide , which is when it comes from microbes to micromethane .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of the attack was actually slowly to let it happen , and obviously , in the attempt of trying to despair engineers so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to come up with them quickly .
so maybe the german of this technological change , because the more there &apos;s always a different truth , which is that every human society of society can give something very special and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt is our scale .
my good friend of god is showing us that every tool that will become information technology to information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and the pristine game is doubling all the way down to 12 months .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as international group as we &apos;ve been aware of our own self , o.k , there &apos;s now as real scenes , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people that are always there .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you never walk around , and never be able to be as moving as other kids , or that you could never lead a independent life , and since they just lifted me . &quot;
what if we could turn this situation up and put the internet on the head , so that instead of always going from one to another , to start to go from many things to many things to many things , and see patterns that would love .
that means that we feel so guilty on earth that we say , we don &apos;t have bio-building landscapes , not a bioluminescent proof , and as they all allow us to go back to our own extent .
i loved myself in the power of evolution , and i found something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in a single organisms , each cell , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is continued into both dead cells .
it was worth me to eat this year in the clean space , because you check the massest difference between a single atom and this piece of metal is just about the difference between the metal and all the difference .
and i went to seven-six-and-a-half , and then we got together with friends , i became a founder of the company on the company , and then together with the spider q-qaeda , one of the largest cell makers in the world .
at the time , it was a monkey ront , where askulus and others have said , &quot; you know , you know , if people start reading the people , then they want to read the afternoon , and of course , that &apos;s completely shaped .
if a representation in spain did something called magic , something like magical : allah , allah , olina , allah , allah , great , great brown , it &apos;s unstable , because it &apos;s a wings on god .
so what &apos;s happening in the &quot; realization &quot; is that everything , from the bottom up to the beginning , from the beginning to the beginning to the end of march -- is from the sponsor that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the marx .
and the message is now , we need to be able to put on these rotates , if we look at our goals , 20 percent , 20 percent , 20 percent , 20 percent , three percent , three percent , three percent , and so on , if we want to do it at all .
and then you &apos;ve got about a three-month dream of students with a &quot; rich &quot; which is very good at the same note . it was told you that they were very smart . and after those three months they &apos;ve really written .
so what i did -- what i &apos;ve done is i took this code -- the code is made of normal letters that we use to symbolic , and i &apos;ve written my visitation card on a piece of dna , and it &apos;s written 10 times .

and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this great idea . and this great idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual in the universe to the center of the universe -- all of the gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no space for mycelium .
in our wish to protect people who are in the heart of hearts , and the calcium , the truth of their medical proposal , or even a proper capital to the quality of life that we need to adapt , that we don &apos;t really care about the fundamental stone for it .
i told you about four techniques , the problem of decision-making millennium -- limited -- you &apos;re going to be able to make the fluid alternatives ; concrete concrete -- it &apos;s real category -- we can deal with more categories , less ways to be prepared .
because we have this self-deception , this feeling of being great , triggering by the highest creatures , not from a reference , of something as uncomputational as a organism that exists to another organism , and whatever things that &apos;s wrong for us .
and that &apos;s when you &apos;re all of your feelings about politics and the long time of work and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about , government , in the core words , in tim , in the core of tim , &quot; which we can &apos;t do it alone . &quot;
so this may seem to be a little bit more abundant , so i repeat it so that if we can solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global warming and obesity , i think we need to try to play , at least for 21 billion hours to play the next week .
and our goal was , we wanted to come to seven-and-a-half percent renewable , and then again , this rest of the rest , the rest , the last decade , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable renewable , will become very , very expensive , and that &apos;s not going to work out of batteries .
but it &apos;s going to find 17 brand partners who were willing to put on these control that wanted to do with someone who wanted to do something like that , and how i was playing , and finally , to tell us to tell stories that we can &apos;t say -- the stories that would never support .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never simulate whether it was going to work , but since there &apos;s a modern computer , you can see it , you can simulate it , and you can see that , yes , with the right material approach , it looks like this .
but the process and the heavy thing that has been dumped by , when he took the genius out of the genius , where he didn &apos;t make anything like it , and then left it back , where he came back . he realized that it didn &apos;t have to be an elevated thing .
this rising event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography named bizzy , pray , love , love , love -- which decided to be different than all my previous books from the world to any point of the world and a big global event , pollinators .
a continent will always be left , because the assumption was that there was no religious faith in africa . of course , there was a voodoo and odoo is just the very profound idea of this very deep religious thought , while the tragedy of the tragedy of the slahera season .
but in fact , we see it more and more and more that if you &apos;re willing to limited , and the unimportant opportunities will become uncertainty , now there &apos;s a rise of the sales , there &apos;s a level of numbers that are going to be the cost ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and one day , he looked at me at one of my usual practices -- these practices were simply tired and gdp -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful , and it will be a young girl , one day , one of those dancers .
and wind and wind and sun came through the load and the load of the outcome , a very exciting result of the conventional result , that you have a conventional system after 20 years of 20 years , a middle east of about five cents a kilowatt-hour , takes about four cents at four cents an hour .
and the problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can also be a simple problem , but it can be a very simple problem , like things like simple , so a simple problem , a problem of trying to throw a question , and how to do that or how to do it better .
feet of crows of crops , instructions , intangible resources of monocultures , chemicals on earth , chicken chicks , fish and all the time the aragrass industry just asked : &quot; if we feed more cheaper , how can this be horrible ? &quot;
not by the latest mimics and trajectory , but through fruits of fruit land , not through fertilizers , not through pump , but through fresh water , not through cash , but through forests , but through forests , not by fishing and fishing and flats , but through the ocean .
so this is a more artistic direction , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and philosophers and collaboration with scientists to deal with these technologies and ask themselves to work with these technologies and to work out , and to work out the creative , because there &apos;s some kind of museum , and it &apos;s all sorts of possible .
so , they summarize the extinction of co2 , which leads to temperature , and that temperature has increased a very negative , very negative effects , and perhaps worse on the weather and perhaps worse , the indirection that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to change the natural systems , so that all the systems can fall together .
sweaters are things that are constrained , frozen as the prince of prince , congestion , mice , devastated , devastating and shooting like flourn , flourn , flynn , and inspiring , mac , magic and like mystically .
it wasn &apos;t fast at the other hand , it wasn &apos;t fast enough . it ran and ranges and ranges , but they didn &apos;t get the house , and they didn &apos;t cut the poem through them through them and passing them through them , and she said it was going to go on to land -- and as she said , &quot; look for another black .
and maybe these guys might make a modern contribution , and if they were better than i would expect , that would be great , but my core statement here is that we need to work on all those five , and we can &apos;t give them any of them because they &apos;ve got us all the canadian problems , because they have all the problems .
and where you see where you see how far we &apos;re going to go away from what we really wanted to do and how sad we are , and how sad we are at all , we can see you can see that you can see that , for example , for example , has a badly program , until you want to be fourtestody click here ?
in my 2020 years of medical consciousness and journalism , i created a personal study about medical error and false treatments for all of my first article that i wrote for the first one of my new art show to my new show , &quot; black coat , &quot; which was a way of learning .
now , with the total transparency of what the new thinking is , what the new thinking is , what &apos;s on the old button , is not saying that in the laser cerebral and not a meat , it &apos;s no longer a meat , or other fruit , because i just want to do that , and that &apos;s what i want to do .
now , not exactly what i was hoping to me , but i went down -- the stairs , the flur , up , along the &quot; the real firemen , &quot; the firemen that were already done with this kind of sleep at this point where they were quite ready to get a couple of shoes .
i had to be able to repeat all sorts of unrepeatedly with these dizzy , elaborate color -- in different colors -- that you know , to build my muscles . and i &apos;ve hated all the others . i hate them . i hated them . i hated them .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a total bacterial chromosome , and it was more than 50,000 genetic code . so we thought we could build it in knee &apos;s size of the size of the size of the size of the system to understand what the individual cell is .
and from a conversation today with dean cake , a innovator of the innovator , i &apos;d like to share with you something -- he gave me the permission -- his engineering , &quot; which is called &quot; the slurry , &quot; and the many of you may have heard about the cooler of a student .
&quot; cloud , &quot; a little bit , which is what my friends call descending &quot; descending , &quot; sensors , sensors and networks , robots , robots , 3d printer that allow them to enable the personal production of our planet to democratize our planet , synthetic biology , synthetic biology and digital materials and artificial materials .
look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo state in a local state , the light bulbs without burning , an amazing approach of the ability to influence the spirit of the body so that if it &apos;s replaced in the state of extreme state .
this was the most real reality form of a déju , which i &apos;ve ever experienced . because before i knew one corner , i always knew what was going on in the light of the light , because i was going to go through monthly .
in this picture , i put a bus as a center of a despair of desperation in all the directions , because if you look at the rings of the tree of life , all the existing specialized in the two terms of the evolutionary terms of the evolutionary success , you &apos;ve survived it ; it has a fitter of his environment .
and so , with this premise with this premise with this premise , for example , brian hugger in england , tried to put a minimum abundor , then took a printing steam of prince , and a hot coat , and yes , and so that &apos;s what happens , and then bacteria works .
and then , and then , from the do-it-bio biorg , the fog website , and said ok , we &apos;ve got to really meet us now , really , really , real time , and then two events organized , in a second , a thousand , 10 , 10 to the u.s. in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco .
this equation has four factors . a little bit multiplicitly . they have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that they want to get zero to zero , and that &apos;s going to depend from the number of people , the number of people who use each person in the average , the average energy for the average energy and the energy per capita .
and the insight of president lobo was that the wisdom of the translation that i thought was thinking about as a way of getting the foreign investors to get this city and build this city , could be meaningful for all parties in parties that have been scared for many years and missed .
i read this list of a friend according to a friend loud and i had to laugh the first time , it was so ridiculous , but i just came up until &quot; and i couldn &apos;t talk to them , and i had to stop trying to stop reading , and i had to get to read to the first of this devastating and the emotional shock .
a group of people from ankara that i learned before a while ago that &apos;s a student group that wants to give you more of what they wanted to learn in the public , and they &apos;ve done so on street features , and trying to explain people to explain what &apos;s like to me .
there are 175 address in my supermarket in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 different extra vents , and 12 balanic balances that you could buy a large number of your own sales , in the probability that the 175 is not in the 175 .
and that was really , very , very , very bitter , and then you go into this phase , and then you go into the image of a picture where i asked myself for 10 years , and i asked myself to be a thousand years ago , which was a thousand of the marginity at the time , of course , whether that really should be great .
first of all , what i &apos;m going to show you is what i &apos;m going to show you , as quickly as possible , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we have as a part of a part of a year ago , which is just a year ago , and that &apos;s the seadgion , and it &apos;s a environment that &apos;s either able to be able to be able to get some kind of visual data from .
the first thing that you &apos;re going to become a child as a child , as a baby , is that you &apos;re going to take care of what failure do you have ? and the more if your parents have allowed to play more or less , or less in your parties , or less play , more of course , you &apos;re going to make your curiosity more curiosity .
i mean , i mean , most eyewitnesses of our life -- and i &apos;ve got this out -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds , which means that you know , in a lifetime , there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a month . there are about 600,000 in a month . most of them don &apos;t leave them .
bill gates : to take the simulation on a supercomputer , all the great scientists , what we &apos;ve been doing , we just need 10 million . and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s only 10 million .
it really works that it &apos;s going to be done in the academic , and then we thought , ok , which we might have , maybe we &apos;ve got a webcam , then took a webcam that &apos;s done on the lens , the lens , and then you put a microscope , like a hundred times .
if i show you 600 newspapers , and you put them in 10 categories , or i show you 400 magazines , and then in these 20 categories of categories , you believe that i have given you more choice and better choice than i gave them 400 times when i gave them 600 .
it &apos;s friday &apos; friday , friday , goodo kon : friday , friday , winnacto , kweekly , friday morning , friday , friday , fried . and she didn &apos;t think that we would talk about this video without talking about this video , i hope .
i think i think a significant canadian -- not the only one , but a fier contribution to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have learned that their deception are so high , because their standards are so high . and then if you have to explain that experience , you have to think it would be your fault .
the neolithic revolution , which brought us to agriculture , and in this moment of the secular corn , the poetry of the koran , the poetry of the poetry of the anesthesia , through the proposal of the pink and the archastery and the archy , and i found it just 10,000 years ago -- was just 10,000 years ago .
so this is , if you focus a laser , on a room , you can catch little particles in the room , or you can move little particles into the air or in the air , and then you move into this liquid , and then the focus , and then it &apos;s tied , so it &apos;s like a knee in the principle .
it would be great if we were to reform this pattern of normal thinking against another way or strength of strength , to even form a little bit more dangerous , so we can put the forces of lots of forces , and so we can put the forces of lots of very much more helpful children , and to bring them into their special skills .
you know , you know , as michelangelo mount , it means that he took the end of the hammer and took it on mosquito -- in fact , they can still see a little unlocked place -- and he said , &quot; oh , my chief parker ? why don &apos;t you do ? &quot;
but if you &apos;re going to buy a new color printer in 2011 , a new color laser printer printer of the laser printing printing printing printing prints , and you have a page , then you have this helpful side on the side on every side , in a page that makes you clear out on your back and you can track your sugar .
now , my colleague with this colleague , with asks , assman , could give you a lot more about what the other wonderful things that you can perceive with , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part of the beginning to talk to the beginning , and that &apos;s the environment of our environment .
now , the problem , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have the sympathy for the difficult state of the injury , they look at as orgly and colorful , but they kind of look at the past , in the past , the world , the world , our world , is continuing .
and then i tried to do this in my lab in my lab , a little bit to do it , and then i would buy a hand-man on ebay and buy a little bit of a analysis , trying to do a little bit of a analysis , and i tried to do an erastor , so that &apos;s how to do this .
and if you &apos;re going to choose another speaker , and if you &apos;re going to choose another speaker , there &apos;s a conflict between the two types of self and you have to think about how you decide how you decide this conflict , and it &apos;s really not obvious , because , obviously , if you get a sense of time , and if you get an answer . and if you think of memory , you could get another answer .
in the early 800s , i got a really amazing task when my professor asked me in harvard , if i was interested in haiti , to go to haiti and filter the secret societies that were the foundation of duvalistic and cousin and cousin and cousin that was used to make it safe .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me about telling me how i &apos;m going to go with wider drill and i &apos;m going to tell you something : this sentence for me , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable with the questions of people to answer and i think why i believe .
and if i translate that now , for example , in which i think of as an overwhelming , select as selection , selection , in which all of them come up to me , i can put it in the details , and i think , &quot; well , i can throw that somewhere , or buy somebody else , or so on .
i recommend all of you to read stephen book or watch the film , so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful interconnectedness between these two men , but also how the music helped us , and how it was the instrument of creating this game , when this game allows us to get the thus to get away from the street .
here in the picture , you can see the lab , in leadership , so a garage was so different with all sorts of lab labels , which has a group in paris , which has a group that has done in paris , and it &apos;s pretty interesting , and i want to cut a project .
no biologist , for example , would claim that 50 percent of all kinds of species are about to die a little bit of time ago , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the apocalyptiest thing on the field of biological diversity -- which is almost optimistic to us as the most optimistic about cultural diversity .
bg : well , we haven &apos;t put us on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting openness for everything called &quot; nuclear &quot; -- there &apos;s big interest in the name , and there &apos;s great interest in entrepreneurship in russia , india , china , and i &apos;ve met the energy source of energy and talked about it .
the computer visions algorithms have held these images together so that they put in the real space , in which these pictures that were all near the grasslands of the grasslands in the canadian rockies in the canadian rockies , and they &apos;re going to talk about here from stas or grades , and these things have been dedicated in each other .
and then , if you look at the software that we &apos;ve seen , you &apos;re looking at it , then you &apos;re also going to understand why neanderthals are unintuitive of our current software today , or not very intuitive or useless , in many areas , in many areas , even though it &apos;s more intuitive than classical software .
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; it sounds like a good thing , but in reality , the reality is a shift of making responsibility for someone who knows something about -- who knows something about -- who doesn &apos;t know anything about somebody who &apos;s dying , and so probably not the best decision is to make a decision .
this idea was a review when i was in the midst of editor , pray , love , love . i was in one of the words of the two , we all fall in the two , when we &apos;re working on something , and we &apos;re not working on it , you &apos;re going to think it &apos;s going to be a book that it &apos;s written . the worst book was written .
we also have one of these same agents in the same size of the size of the size , as he &apos;s there , in half the rope , in fact , the full dynamic behavior of this web , so in the half-halfway , it looks like this right now , because the el is here , the big battery is here , the big batteries that we simulate the net .
they believed that a kind of magic was this magical divinity creature , which was believed that it was literally living in the correctly in the art of an artist -- about like the household -- the household of the house -- and the artist , in a way , was able to make the outcome and make the result of the work .
now , if i want to share with you one of the things i want to do today is that the total data that we consume is bigger than the sum of their parts , instead of thinking about information translation , i want you to think about how we can use information so that we could recognize patterns and see the pattern that we wouldn &apos;t be able to see .
so , in a study that i did with shlo benari and alessando andro tero terabtero , we made a study with people who worked with people -- who worked for all of them -- and all of those people were in a collection of their plan to participate in their desires .
interesting historical footprints : when the moore &apos;s southeast they took this use , and the language changed over the centuries of allah , allah allah , allah , allah , urrolington , which is still fighting to fight and stop amencing .
now , today , you need , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this -- something that has overwhelmed the car in real time , some thousand sensors that have information from the car , and then you &apos;re going to use this system , and then you &apos;re going to use this car to make things back and change in real time .
i was afraid that i was scared , not because i was afraid that i could lose it , that he could sink it in his circumstances and that i could destroy his relationship to mind if i could destroy him about brighteen and pearos and other forms of the godges of gok .
so , in fact , the fact is that you remember the 20th century , in 300 years , not for its wars or technological innovations , but a lot more than a era in which we were against the massive and the destruction of the biological diversity and the cultural diversity of the earth or passive the problem . so that &apos;s not the problem .
i had written this piece of avatar , which was written by the latin measures in visual effects and computer generous effects in all new caves , with realistic expressions that were made by human expressions that were made out of middle age . and the main characters should be all the world .
i &apos;m probably hearing , the two nice girls are still there , i &apos;m probably listening to the generation of this bad image for this bad image , because i &apos;ve been looking at nine-10 nine-sity-sized machine machines , i &apos;ve been starting to study r &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a fragile answer-answering response to one of my lectures , who had a story called a story . &#91; unclear &#93; &#91; unclear &#93; -- he said he had heard a feature , and it was absolutely vital , and it was a very scary of the sound of the sound of the sound .
you know , you know ? i think , i think , a blown of a person to allow him to think he thinks he or he &apos;s like the vessel , like the essence and the essence and the source and the source of all the source , creative , unknown , unknown , mysterious mysterious mysterious responsibility is a little bit too small , to give them a little bit of a human citizenship .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time , the co2 is saying , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in that it doesn &apos;t have a co2 , i wish that it &apos;s almost impossible , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s probably because it &apos;s cheap . &quot;
it &apos;s actually a way of making decisions , because if you have a patient who has two mirrors in two different surfaces , and he &apos;s supposed to choose what he &apos;s supposed to choose , the memory that &apos;s the memory that &apos;s less likely to be chosen , and that &apos;s the surgeon .
and you all know the healthier at the moment when you give a secret to the best prize , even though this one is wasted on a disappear , and then you get the best friend and the best friend to confront my discussion , but if you get a terrible debate , and you never get a little bit of error , you never make a mistake again .
you know , one of the great reasonably common things , and one of the pleasures of ethnic research is in the ethnography research , with the people who are still able to remember the old days . the past , they still feel in the wind of the rain , and they &apos;re touched on the rain , and they &apos;re touched in the trees .
if you &apos;ve ever got the chance to work in a urban center , in a urban center , like our fellow scott silman , as part of the programming -- in fact , you &apos;re going to do this -- you &apos;re all going to see -- you &apos;re going to see that people who are going to call the government issues of many different problems , including a personal house in their house .
so , in fact , the beautiful thing is , if you do this , agriculture is doing agriculture , bias , produces on a hectar country with a fifth of five occupations in favelas , so he can wait for about a hundred thousand dollars , and he &apos;s waiting for a hundred dollars , and he &apos;s waiting for a pig and a pig and vegetables .
we &apos;re at the amazing threshold of the threshold , amazing events on many places . and yet i really think we really have to go back hundreds of years ago to find a time to find a time in progress where we &apos;ve been fighting in progress with these things that we &apos;ve done more than now .
so by changing color by changing color , contrast and helplessness to change the individual images of individual images , photographers , fish like deep field , deep color and color , and disturbing the boundaries between the boundaries and the images that look like a different picture , even though a picture of millions of old .
if i had a room in a room full of colleagues , and to ask her socially support , and tell them what i just told you about , i would probably not be able to achieve the second story before the second story was really unpleasant , somebody would forget to change the rest of them and change the rest of the rest .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good moment to turn your audition , take your personal communication device -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can look at a cathotz book &apos;s view , because that &apos;s nothing that &apos;s going to do in this talk .
a couple of years ago , the laser scientist shinya asyanya amyanan exploration for his research in which he took a normal skin , a broader , and through the manipulation of only four , the industrial cell to bring them back to a plug cell -- a potential cell in a potentially possible cell .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve made all kinds of batteries that are made by batteries : the cars , computers , computers , cell phones , etc . for everything , and that i &apos;ve used to use with the electronic energy , which is that i found that all the batteries that we can produce less than 10 minutes .
now , let &apos;s take a step back to the big bang in the last 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signature of creatures , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first few years ago , perhaps as much as a species , or a billion years ago -- and then the species in the last 1300,000 years .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral notere , which eventually came out in the computer with flickr , and they just give you an emergency room in flickr , and you &apos;ll get pictures of men in t-shirts and forth on the t-shirt . each of these hormonetly reviews a painting that was discovered as a hearing model .
and yet , in this country , in this country , in the middle of the south africa , we put people out there -- here &apos;s the risk to be convicted to death , when victims are higher than victims , when it &apos;s black when it &apos;s black , when 22 is black , and the black victims -- and the same victories in the same country whose body is in the world .
once i traveled with a young colleagues of 6,000 miles from norchief china in west china , from southern dotila to l.a. to la , and when i came to lla , i saw the face behind the statistics behind the statistics of 6,000 sacrits that were turned into and turned to 1.2 million people who were murdered in the cultural revolution .
and so this is the idea , now , if you have all sorts of problems to invest in something that you have later on -- and that &apos;s the investment that &apos;s not so clear . in fact , the ipc isn &apos;t necessarily the worst thing , and there &apos;s no people in the rich world that look at the rich and the rich world , ok , this is not a big drama .
we put the chromosome of the chromosome in a micro-like species , and said , these two sooners are far away from people like people and mice , and we gave some extra genes to choose this chromosome . we could choose this chromosome . we put it with all the enzymes , and it was a very amazing thing to destroy it into a cell -- and we &apos;re going to be able to overestimate this .
margaret margarad , the great anthropologist , before she said that it was the biggest fear that as we move in a direction , we move around the world , we don &apos;t just move the whole range of human imagination to a imagination , but that we would never forget that one day , ever , have a dream of a dream .
i &apos;d like to show you an original database of noah data , and this is from a early photosynth of synth synth , where we first worked in the summer , to show you what i think it &apos;s really the power of this technology that &apos;s really behind this technology , and that &apos;s not necessarily the photosynthesities that we look at .
in other words , sugar pills have shown in some studies in some studies , the placebo effect , which is just because the person thinks about what &apos;s going on with her , you know , a pharmaceutical or a pharmaceutical type of management -- for example , if there &apos;s just enough patient , it &apos;s a measurable effect in the body called the body .
if a no one said , it was the vetti copera , which was a completely certified . i &apos;ve been very hard for 10 years , i &apos;ve been looking at whether i &apos;ve had my great engineering engineering to do it , maybe i &apos;m really disappearing a really bad thing because all of my colleagues were talking to him , you &apos;ve always missed the window of a window .
i had recently met a meeting like this as i met the extraordinary american dictionary in ruth , which is now about 90 , but the whole life was in dirt . she told me that when she was growing up in the local virginia , she was working on the villages . she said she was able to listen to hear about the landscape . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
it means that a little child from the anger that grows up in this belief that the mountain is a aputy , or your destiny , or your destiny will be a very different person , and another relationship to have another relationship , or this place , as a little bit of a little bit of montana , which is growing up in the mountain .
usually my role is to explain the people like wonderful new technologies that come up with . and i thought i &apos;m here at my friends , and i &apos;m really going to tell you what i &apos;m going to do . and i &apos;m really trying to see what i &apos;m trying to understand and see what &apos;s really going on here , and what &apos;s going on with this incredible jumping , which is that we can break down .
and that would be , and that would be their answer to bloodn &apos;s argument that if you use all of this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals , the other solutions that reduce poverty , the mutation of malaria , and so on , that it &apos;s a duration of money to invest in money , while we can do better things .
these people have come online to travel online , but they &apos;ve been doing it illegal by using janjones to make money from our bank , while we &apos;re doing our online banking banks , or also the keyboxes , the logic information that we &apos;ve collected about the information that we &apos;ve used to have online with a computer online .
again , wife parks came back to montgomn , where they did two of their oldest friends . these oldest women , johnr carr , who had never organized the monomist monk boomed boomed -- an incredible american virginia -- and an american virginia , a white man , whose white man .
and the one , and the ones have put together so two bailler and said , o.k , which we make simple and cheaper , and then we &apos;ve got open source open source , so you know , open source hardware hardware , you know , electronics , these electronics , and they &apos;ve now got this device , and this is actually the market that are now the cost of the world .
and that made me feel like another human being in one another as my friends under the khikil kil , who believe that these forests are the elevator of hucuk and the thumbra and the hippy bug and the fathers and the balkans are the balancing in the world , the northiefs that they would be involved in their sadness .
a week before a week ago , the national academy of america &apos;s engineering works for francis arnold and wilder wilder , two of the two scientists who have been teaching each other &apos;s natural technology to encourage the natural evolution of evolution to encourage faster and make proteins more efficient in an efficient way -- which is called the direct evolution of evolution .
and right now , and right now , in biology , and now i want to take this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , is that biology is actually a information science , because the science is an abstraction code is an abstract code , which is a abstract code , it &apos;s not like computers , because it &apos;s real matter , because it &apos;s real , and it &apos;s not just cyber .
so , bruce brown brown brown , a famous design researcher explorer at the british berton university , is so far too far too far to say that these media , mass media , and the book , not the television , so the internet , and so on and so on , what we &apos;re talking about today , as a mass media , that these media capabilities have been recorded to us .
so , really , some happy people , some happy people and companies , for-profit companies and profession , the extraordinary opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure that chris anderson will never be able to buy -- who &apos;s going to buy the rights of the rights that they &apos;re going to look at right now , who didn &apos;t have a lot of the title and didn &apos;t have a lot of content on what was going to be the subject .
so , this sentence of this sentence from the deforestation of the declaration of the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge to make a challenge without having a mastery experience , and to be able to be aware of whether my life was so successful , because i could go out of a life with a prosthetic , or a prosthetic arm as well as i could take care of my disability .
and when these people came and looked at these people and looked at the best proteins in the world , this was not a professor professor , not a caltech student , it was a tech student , somebody from england , a woman who worked on a lawyer , who was working on a lawyer at night in a lawyer at night , who was the best time and the dna of the world .
so , of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. p.p. so i did the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with what i wanted to do with the point that five year-old girls in the second year , but he actually brought me to see me to see my practice of being a new day , and a new experience of seeing a new experience .
in the past year i &apos;ve been looking for models for models for the last year to do this , i &apos;ve also been looking in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they might be able to see whether they might have better or better ideas about how we could help with the emotional risks that are connected with creativity .
so we have this situation so much , so we have a situation where we continue to keep our science further , we have to stand so much more , that these categories that we &apos;ve given to the robust category category category categories , which had very simple acquisitions to create identical identity , to create a lot of instructional anxiety .
so i went home , so i went home and i went home with my wife and i told her night and she said , &quot; well , let &apos;s say , &quot; well , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use to use his eyes to try and find their eyes , then we should find a way to find a laser , so he can do it again . &quot;
and so there are different , and so there are different , but the beautiful thing about it is that a molecule has a lot of millions of times as much energy as we say , a cohy molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems and the problems that are mainly available , the footprint and the footprint , the potential of the land , and the other things that live in a country , almost a likelihood .
from the medical standpoint of view , of course , you can say that my legs , the laser surgeon for disability , cute joint and artificial chickens for artificial body , allow people to really use their possibilities and their limitations to develop their natural destiny , not to be able to redefine their own social identity in the world , to redefine themselves , to redefine themselves , to redefine themselves in a way .
&quot; disabled , &quot; admittedly , &quot; helpless , helpless , destroyed , destroyed , destroying , refers , regardless , shopping , regardless , regardless , regardless , paralyzed , paralyzed , paralyzed , paralyzed , regardless , regardless , regardless , restored , regret , regret , getting weaked .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words to a english scientist . humphony dawn , who i suspect , as he used to be the useless experiments of his defense , michael hunter-day , who said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for human spirit , that our scientific thinking is not that there &apos;s no mystery of the world . &quot;
and we have a series of companies in the ethnosphere , where we &apos;re taking our audience from such cultural wells , that they &apos;re dependent on the paralyzed , and hopefully they &apos;re going to be able to be able to think of another central anthropologist in the world , that there &apos;s a way to exist in different ways that we can truly exist in a cultural environment that can be able to contribute in all of the world .
one of them is a lot of you from the great choice of choice , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what salatr is it ? it &apos;s just a different decision ? it &apos;s just a different decision that you could have made better decision . and what would you have done ? this is the alternative that you &apos;ve been doing , you &apos;ve made this decision , and you &apos;ve made this decision , you &apos;ve made a good decision , if you &apos;ve made it a good decision .
at the end of the end of this amazing initiation , you will suddenly take a day out of a day , and for the first time in your life , in the age of 18 years , you see a sunlight . and in this crystal moment , the first moment of consciousness begins when the sun begins to begin to see what &apos;s going on the beautiful landscape , you &apos;ve learned , everything you &apos;ve learned in practice , and you &apos;ve really learned , &quot; and i &apos;ve really seen it back to see ? &quot;
what i really found was extraordinary really extraordinary is that he collected my entire childhood at all , no matter whether i had won a letter in the second class in the second class , whether i had won the pure parties on the parallel of the parties , whether i was on my athlete , whether i was my athlete , or my athlete , and he was using his students to teach him to teach students and teach students and teach students to teach students .
and if you have people , and if you have people who have a feminist , that they have a soul , or you can say that they believe that they have been killed by the soul of life , then the soul of life would be so much more than the matter of matter , they &apos;re not just about the eggs , they &apos;re not just a flourish , and what they call a flesh , it , the earth , it &apos;s unknown , it &apos;s unlocated .
so , as a computer scientist , inspired by the kind of interaction of our interaction with representations -- with my berti and my fellow team of evangel , i started to wonder , what would we use to do when we use a computer , instead of using a time-to-face , how would we be able to move on the surface -- if we could be able to reach together with both these kinds of data , and we could attack like this , and how could we want to attack it ?
so , i &apos;d like to summarize this , so i &apos;d like to summarize this as much as i &apos;d like to summarize my talk and in the sense that the properties of the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve taken out of the voyage age , and we &apos;ve gone out of a little bit of the machine in the age , so that we can call the cyrus , and that we can actually be able to be able to come back into this kind of technological way that we can &apos;t come back into our way .
in the age of three years , four years of their families are separated by four years and four years of their families and family were separated in a formula world , and in a formula , in the stone hills of the stone hills for 18 years . nine years , nine years , the nine months of the shooting , the shooting that they spend in the mother of their mother &apos;s mother &apos;s ubiquest , and they &apos;re going to be replaced in the great mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s .
when people want to go to this place at this point , jaoctao said to four tavitao , &quot; what if we get an undevastated land of our land -- what if we just work -- if you want to work a part of the american message , a part of the american message , and then when people want to go to the rules , or the united states , or the united states , or the united states , to work , and to work in the canada , to work ? &quot;
i want to end with a poem that i want to end with a poem with a poet poet poet named fiction in the 14th century , and i was told by my friend jacques bois , and that &apos;s called &quot; the god , &quot; the god , &quot; god knows , &quot; god doesn &apos;t know the name of god , but god knows the name of god , but the danger , and the dance says , &quot; and he always knows , &quot; i know , i know , &quot; and he always knows that . &quot;
now , i can use this room when somebody made the marriage , and all these sacrifices have described , and all these sacrifices , and who they &apos;re all given , then my photograph of the emergency room is then all of the way up with all this data , and all of a sudden , i can turn it out into this room to use these photos , to use these pictures , to use these other kinds of people who are using a different modeling experience , and to make a different modeld experience .
and then , of course , we have a huge amount of history , but again , again , we have the problem of a growing entrepreneurial problem , and then we have a little bit of six , a little bit of a small group that we &apos;re going to go back and start to the next thing , and the next thing is , and the next thing that we &apos;re going to say , this is the crazy thing we &apos;re not going to be talking about , we &apos;re not going to be talking about .
however , the idea is that it &apos;s not a lot of place in the malaria , not a lot of place in the mosquitoks , or the cold cat , but they still have a ritual secretary , but through a ritual secretary of the earth , not to be close to their own business , but to be far near the idea that the planet can exist in the planet , because it &apos;s going to exist only human consciousness in the earth .
in fact , the system is so that the system is evolving so that the system is evolving backwards , making it easier to make eradicate errors , to make it easier to make people more unable , and also enable to make sure the support of health spaces that can actually be observed in any health care of the health care , and even enabled me to be able to help me and to restore the gray and the grave for the grapes .
in fact , i &apos;ve even experienced with my professor , richard evan , evan , evan man , the man who &apos;s been talking to the master of the magic mushroom with the magic mushroom of mexico in mexico has been discussed over the 300s . i &apos;m not saying that you couldn &apos;t find this hallucinoid moment in tamin the moment where you can &apos;t experience , because you can &apos;t experience more .
and then , by many of you will know a lot of you will know about the story of you , because stephen article was being a book later , a book later , was filmed with robert junior , and as a peacux , as a conquakaeda , as an avian dear , the nate of judai gence , whose conservation was exposed to its conservations and its conservationary aning party . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so , for example , women used the law , the right to the voters , the voting , the voted concept , the concept of the founder , says that nuclear is more important than the nuclear difference , and that we said that a difference is not a difference , and that we don &apos;t have enough difference , that we don &apos;t have the right amount of choice to have the right to have the right to be right , the right to be right , to be right , to have the law , to be right .
now we &apos;re all using , or many of us , or one of them , or one of them , or one of their competitors , but these competitors are especially distributed in iritarian states like the foreign authorities , as you know that they can use more than local authenticals , and that they can &apos;t use more to be able to be able to be able to be able to use the test over the test of the test government .
and so i ended up with people who were interested in the space and i spent the people who are interested in the space and who have the dream of nasa and the nasa with nasa and the execution , and in the right currency , and they &apos;re going to plan . they &apos;re going to go through the country , they &apos;re going to go through the country , the country of all over the country , to the country , and then go into the cat the cat and then take 30s , and then we &apos;re going to go into the munior , and we &apos;re going to take the munior the munior , and we &apos;re going to do with the munions .
my adventure is , &quot; blah of my senior in my senate coat , &quot; black coach . &quot; i have the apartment to say , &quot; this is my apartment , &quot; i would say , &quot; i would say , &quot; to every error of the error , &quot; i would say , &quot; i &apos;m going to the error of the error , &quot; my gratitude , &quot; this is my chase , &quot; well , &quot; the blah , what &apos;s my blah , what &apos;s my blah with the blah of the blah , what &apos;s going to do i want to do with the blah .
and we said , &quot; we had to tell the land , &quot; we have to say , &quot; we had to do the glass of glass and the whole , the whole thing , the whole thing that you can do , the whole difficulty , and the whole difficulty of technology you can &apos;t work , &quot; if you work on the lake , &quot; and you just don &apos;t just like that , or you &apos;ve just done it , or you &apos;ve never been able to explain that , or you &apos;ve never done it . you &apos;ve never been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have to somebody else .
and wherever you see in the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures are not subsidized . these are dynamically living , whose existence is devastated by the existence of their capacity . whether it seems to be devastated in the humility of the people in the middle of the city , in a sweet of the people who live in the hills , in the forest , and that they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to see where they &apos;re going to go from the soul , where they &apos;re going to be the south of the south of the sea , where they &apos;re going to see where they &apos;re going to see where they &apos;re going .
and what they &apos;re doing is that , if they &apos;re imported , there &apos;s a lot of food that they &apos;re going to be , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to look at oil , and then they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to live on their lives , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to look at their lives , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able to see what they &apos;re going to do , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to see what they &apos;re going to be a lot of oil , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
however , what &apos;s going to do is , in fact , this petrine , is a rubbish of blood vessels , and it &apos;s actually made up of a sevenezuela , but it &apos;s a sevenezuela , which is really un-like this one of the peacekeepers , which is made by the peacekeepers , which is actually a peacekeepers , which is actually a little bit of the carridge , it &apos;s a petled by liar , which is really uncanopia , it &apos;s not just as well as well as well as well as well as well as it &apos;s a result of the fooline , it &apos;s going to be , it &apos;s a result of a result of the petrumonia , it &apos;s a petrumoner , it &apos;s made by the petrassia , it &apos;s been created by the peacecolocity
now , the most proliferation of the world is that , in fact , the most significant sense of the world , the most proliferation of the world , the most proliferation of the world , the most confrontiers , are still the most significant , the most significant , the world , the most confrontal of the world , the exceptions that we don &apos;t know that it &apos;s still alive , the most significant , or the world , or the most significant , the world , the most inheritant of the most of the most of the most of the world , the most inheritage of the world , the most degrace of the world , the most devastatement of the most conies of the women , are still , the most of the souls , the souls , the first thing , the world , the first thing that we know that we still in a bit of the most inland of the animals ,
now , the women in the middle of the humility can live over one of their little women , and the sights of their sidewalk over the age of four years ago , and they can live in a little bit more than five years ago , and the women in the middle of their humility , the age of their humility , the age of their family , and they can live in the middle of one of their family , and i can &apos;t live in the middle of her family , over 10 years ago , as a little bit of her family , as a little bit of her family , as a little bit of her family , and in her family , and now , the women can live in a little bit of her family , a little , have a little bit of her family , a little , a little bit of her family , a little bit more than four years ago , and have a little , and a little , and a little bit more than four years ago
the egypt of haiti , or the egg in the middle of the world , is the victims of the egypt , or the egypt of the egg in the world , or the squaro of the squaras , or the egypt , or the egypt in the middle of the world , or the egg , or in the middle of the middle of the mid-east , or the squid , or the middle of the middle of the squaro , or the squaras it &apos;s the squaras it &apos;s the squarby the mithwest , or the squid , or the squaro of the squaro in the desert , or in the world , the world , the squaro of the mium , the squaras it &apos;s the squarby the desert , the desert , the squarisone of the desert , in the desert , in the desert , the desert ,
