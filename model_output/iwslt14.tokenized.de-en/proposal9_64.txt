from seattle ...
i don &apos;t know .
which is singing .
but it &apos;s going .
don &apos;t find .
yes , hello .
we love innovation .
solar is ...
that &apos;s not ...
we were poor .
is that all ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
after a week .
great trick ?
that &apos;s what we were .
a few less .
and he says ...
we know that .
tada !
wait twice .
here it is .
that &apos;s going fast .
they need time .
music as a language .
that &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... not yet .
thank you .
what a fish .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
that &apos;s efficient .
wonderful ?
completely inefficient .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much .
hire them .
the only chance .
there &apos;s no hospital .
thank you very much .
stephen watts .
three out of 10 .
that was incredible .
thank you . thank you .
yeah , in a way .
it &apos;s terrible .
long , yes .
fantastic , right ?
the sun goes up .
oh my god .
we love entertainment .
let &apos;s pick up .
after home , where ?
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we lose them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
a lot of stuff .
sounds good ?
the whole environmental debate .
sounds familiar , what ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
that &apos;s great .
that was fascinating .
can i be honest ?
the farm is incredible .
what did you do ?
robert gupta .
this is the system .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
yeah , good day .
lento , slowly .
that &apos;s all interested in me .
we can do that .
what do you say ?
not very sustainable .
yes , milliseconds .
that &apos;s our present .
they have similar principles .
yeah , good day .
good work ! yeah !
just do your job .
this was the result .
thank you very much .
and she did .
so they meet al .
it &apos;s essential .
they &apos;re all important .
very different term .
immensely exciting .
that &apos;s me even .
it &apos;s g.net .
yeah , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
flying cats .
this is the last one .
can we change it ?
these days are over .
these people deserve money .
what happened here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
they did again .
and that &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know .
centers were built .
what happened here ?
but you know what ?
what was the result ?
i was amazed .
it &apos;s generic .
so they knew everything .
you could see manhattan .
here &apos;s the video .
it has sensors .
why not live longer ?
he opens the door .
a couple more .
that &apos;s very good .
oh , so the one .
there &apos;s no normal .
yeah , i know .
pretty good , not ?
but you know what ?
i have a question .
okay . thank you .
i stood up to him .
players don &apos;t sit around .
so they do that .
they &apos;re bad . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
what do these people need ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i thought about it .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
they use their hands .
so how does this work ?
how interested they are .
that would have been okay .
what are media today ?
you can go in .
so where do we go ?
so it &apos;s true .
how do we know this ?
because you know what ?
it &apos;s not a country .
why do we do that ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
bg : thank you .
this is a wish .
and i was an artist .
let &apos;s call it don &apos;t .
not school management .
and the one has to go back .
we can do it differently .
they even do weh .
and i understand that .
an immense challenge .
there &apos;s no food .
it &apos;s against justice .
but the wrong things .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
i &apos;m a writer .
here &apos;s another example .
i &apos;m treating children .
it feels great .
i swear it .
i wonder .
it &apos;s not going to do that .
thank you very much .
why should we do that ?
thank you .
here &apos;s an example .
you see it immediately .
not toxic in there .
but i continued to work .
or bombs or bombs .
i &apos;m going to go in here .
there are two options .
we need energy miracle .
why does this happen at all ?
oh . a moment .
i want to tell you .
what do you want to do ?
that &apos;s what happens today .
and i kept working .
so she was back .
and that &apos;s how it was .
yeah , here &apos;s it .
i &apos;m going to agree with you .
and why is that ?
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what would everything be done ?
i mean the soul .
you do the same thing .
in china , it was different .
luckily , yes ?
that &apos;s not a protection .
take pee a chance .
does somebody see something particular ?
and i had always .
very expensive mobilizes .
people were crazy .
what creates the illusion ?
my gut feeling again .
just after a journey .
first of all , constraints .
i created one .
yeah . well . good .
imagine the camera .
jk : both .
but it gets worse .
here you see it .
thank you very much .
be a mentor .
maybe 10 times .
but it didn &apos;t .
the data came in .
that &apos;s a great question .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
it has billions of them .
have you seen these guys ?
but there &apos;s something else .
here &apos;s another example .
is it photography at all ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
ohhh .
and then it became international .
there were remixes .
let me summarize .
okay , a few more .
the answer is no .
just continue . much fun .
my name is amit .
he had the experience .
it keeps you fresh .
that &apos;s a great question .
is that your opinion ?
a almost identical structure .
and it was getting better .
that &apos;s what they did .
it locked him very much .
here you see the city .
good day , all together .
am i going to like the color ?
ooh , thank you .
some have come and gone .
i think we don &apos;t think so .
dk : 60,000 .
there &apos;s an old study .
don &apos;t be frightened .
the game is from 2007 .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
it &apos;s called paul offit .
now , what did you think ?
who will make it safe ?
first , we have the population .
i don &apos;t like that question .
but what do your fish eat ?
let &apos;s also call him don &apos;t .
this is precautionary .
the work of the interpreted .
but where are we useful ?
they had no mass media .
how do we actually work people ?
... his own story to invent .
i will never forget that .
so what does that mean ?
well , what does that mean ?
privacy must be given .
there are online criminals .
we have three main groups .
it was still fish .
he always showed up here .
and then it happened again .
i felt really good .
and many people forget this .
crisis . disaster . disaster .
it would be inheritable .
it &apos;s not our fight .
it &apos;s not our problem .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
why not think about that ?
we love technology and creativity .
it would be knowledge .
we &apos;re constantly refining each other .
and this opens up a map .
but what do we do with this ?
this is something like this .
what am i looking at ?
his name is tempt .
is it going to have my size ?
that sounds crazy , right ?
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
we need to spread the message .
that &apos;s what most of you know .
that &apos;s what you have to understand .
this is what you see down there .
i want to ask you something .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was destroyed on the ground .
and then they look like this .
is it about the light ?
i grew up in india .
this is the short-term .
you see the water coming .
i had a good life .
so what happened for years ?
who are these relatives ?
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
these changes are in the space .
how about fitness ?
that &apos;s the exciting end .
but the key is ...
it works like this .
and then they put them up .
what &apos;s actually happening here ?
the orange tractor .
they really loved it .
but i felt worse .
the two guys called me .
woman : overlegendary technology .
very frightening .
what &apos;s the soul ?
we &apos;re not producing ourselves anymore .
i can claim everything .
he went up and down .
what can we do ?
this is what the graphics looked like .
now , i get to the end .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
it might sound jewish .
we were 20 people .
so we &apos;re too many .
you can &apos;t have bone .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
or is it possible ?
there are conflicts of conflict creativity .
so what do we have to do ?
they didn &apos;t have books .
this is felix .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
thank you for your attention .
this was the beginning of the journey .
i am honored .
and then everybody went down .
they saw the big impact .
first longevity , second .
well , i was the next one .
so , honestly , who is normal ?
and finally , epic meaning .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
the same thing , only bigger .
who &apos;s the most successful ?
they want to feed the world ?
i wanted to support them .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
i just loved two .
one place is south korea .
again , you &apos;ve got it again .
that &apos;s a natural thing .
my wife told me .
and how did that feel ?
that &apos;s what you can train .
do you make the curiosity curious ?
so it &apos;s a circle .
now , why hack ?
this happened around christmas .
what is this for a thing ?
it &apos;s about , you know .
they could have done better .
the answer is , &quot; yes . &quot;
i don &apos;t have to worry .
and that &apos;s nothing even more .
is that reasonable ?
so that &apos;s the good news .
it was a huge success .
so they saw something magical .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
but can &apos;t be a problem .
they always say , why ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
it was just not invented yet .
consequence should work even further .
anyone know what that is ?
for example , this perception in context .
this is a game outside .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
but it was very sad .
so let me remind you .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
and it &apos;s the x .
sometimes i push too much .
but they do the job .
they &apos;re connected to these two people .
her mother just moved her .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
think about your own decisions .
this picture is from this place .
i see this plusda .
and it took 18 months .
tell me about this world .
this is very risky .
and that worked very well .
again , the jaw showed him four .
i learned everything .
and there are hundreds of them .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there &apos;s good news .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
that made me really sad .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
but it &apos;s not that fast .
how can we help you ? &quot;
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
no , no , was an opportunity .
the story is not over yet .
what &apos;s happened on this day ?
well , then we want to .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
they come from artists .
i should not say that .
the power plant can explode .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
they did it for three years .
you can have this cloud .
the data was not available before .
game is not silly .
now , how could this happen ?
is it all about education ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
so that &apos;s what we can do .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
don &apos;t taste very well .
game doesn &apos;t mean just child games .
and that was 19 years ago .
what would you like most ?
they create an epic story .
they have so much uncertainty .
the data is constantly doing it .
nobody has ever said that before .
so paul is a terrorist .
and that &apos;s actually what he says .
don &apos;t take anything like this .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what should our experience look like ?
this is a lot of volume .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
i never cook with it .
she was back and die .
and of course , this is incredible returns .
and again , the representation .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
an autistic student .
if it &apos;s the garbage right now .
so not like detox .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
we depend on two countries .
everybody needs a goldfish glass .
let &apos;s be a gear . &quot;
people were still happy .
it was my first sunfire .
in fact , he collected fish .
my name is brian goldman .
they share their experiences with others .
the white lines are for population .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
he showed up the algae .
it &apos;s just not technologically technologically .
there are four and a thousand people .
and already , you have a problem .
and we &apos;re very happy about that .
every case is nutrient .
and we &apos;re too many .
so the question is : how ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and it was an incredible experience .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
but there are two problems here .
i started feeling better .
but , you know what ?
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
that was a great deal .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
that &apos;s it , it &apos;s very simple .
we &apos;re in an area .
and that &apos;s what we did .
basically , they do the same thing .
this is one of the images .
what other brand do you do ?
and then something weird happened .
you can play with different ways .
the whole building was made of water .
italy wins . yeah .
morning , in front of the game .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
the creativity had to kind of get out of it .
today , everything is easy to have .
asked the nurse .
i should probably not do that .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
and it starts with a doctor .
i &apos;m going to tell you something .
we use the energy of the sun .
this is all metadata .
i can claim everything .
it will always be similar to you .
slowly , but sure enough , it turned out .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
further than that , we don &apos;t .
what lessons are we learned ?
and the shape plays a role .
they can &apos;t store energy .
then i can translate the whole thing .
okay , that really makes courage .
once , we started a vivid .
my second mistake was worse .
and she gets a 257 .
we all love baseball , right ?
somehow , kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
this is about five meters long .
they become free in the computer .
because anyone here has masks ?
and then it becomes real .
other things should not suffer .
this one has the biggest impact .
the movements , to write it .
anyway , not to navigate .
and that &apos;s very much in the beginning .
the truth is more like this .
do you want jeans with holes ?
that &apos;s how you can &apos;t do anything .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
her family gathered up .
thank you very much for your patience .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
what else is risky ?
just be you , who you are .
i remember my first fire .
what does a story look like ?
it &apos;s dark . dark .
i was trying to do something exciting .
but really , effective , yes ?
but we need the total .
zerlemissions , yes ?
this is completely inherent .
let &apos;s leave this quiet to us .
hmmm , my brand ?
this is scary .
that sounds fear .
next : nuclear energy .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
i wanted to be normal at the time .
so this is what i &apos;m going to show you .
as soon as the judge saw me .
we can &apos;t just do that .
so i went to court .
i got a scared of technology .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
and there are several reasons for this .
they sell certificate .
it &apos;s not being documented .
why did i go to medicine ?
it can know where we are .
it spreads rapidly .
all adults were aware of the risks .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i like things that are different .
i went to jail -- difficult .
this didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
this is a child game , right ?
isn &apos;t it overwhelming ?
and this video is in real time .
the game starts -- swiss .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
what about longevity ?
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
so the correlation is low .
so , look what happens .
it &apos;s really changed the dynamics .
so i just started playing .
and then we said , okay .
yes , these are the data .
i shoot something through your head .
were you even neither dispute ?
this is like learning .
because for me , it means memory .
how and what does he feel ?
we say in germany sustainability .
so you can &apos;t solve that at all .
music is medicine . music changes us .
it turns out that it &apos;s really difficult .
and you know what i learned ?
these will be unconstrained .
but what &apos;s going to come in the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
this has nothing to do with science .
and that can make a big difference .
but there &apos;s another reason .
anyway , we need a solution .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
so i listen to this , thank you very much .
they flooded the channels .
in the assumption , maybe two percent .
we started out 15 years ago .
how far do you get there ?
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
you know what is neither ?
so the first step to a interpretation .
and it &apos;s still not a interpretation .
this must be the aging difference .
if you come to that , yes ?
you can show me , i was there .
that &apos;s the minimum of the minimum .
we can win our nutrients .
anyone know what three seconds are ?
on the book and on the picture .
this picture reminded me of something .
i find them off .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but maybe this is not the case .
and what does this mean for the designers ?
i want to prove that to you .
it was quite a very fate project .
here he makes the sun go .
this is the storage .
these fluids are going to be way .
a has these benefits and risks .
our magazines are read by millions .
lego made it possible for everyone .
private sphere isn &apos;t the debate .
they were genetically inherited .
i &apos;m the new physician .
i don &apos;t take the same line .
baseball is full of great statistics .
because we live on a water planet .
do we really want to go to this direction ?
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
this gave you a evolutionary advantage .
and these are the neural structures .
they haven &apos;t given the government .
oh , my time is over ?
something is rising in me .
well , that &apos;s not right .
so we measured his movement .
this is a picture of the object .
apparently it was quite popular .
you see something fun here .
i like to really like beautiful clothing .
he can only use his eyes .
but the truth is far away .
you can do this all the time .
so this crazy story could be true .
who would ever have a wish ?
the netherlands would have been too easy .
her father died shortly after her birth .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a cents .
we need to increase the complexity .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
here &apos;s your march line .
it &apos;s supposed to eradicate experience .
but then they really want to go deep .
they want to orient in the museum ?
that was more concrete .
okay , you really want to know ?
and i had to go out of the city .
we won a few prices .
who don &apos;t want to make a healthier child ?
it makes shame at kids .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
no , i really mean it .
i hold the knife in my hand .
and the goal is very simple .
i go back to my sleeve .
architects and engineers , for happiness .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
now i see greg moon .
a billion people are going to be hungry today .
do you do that for the children ? &quot;
i was very excited about this fish .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and this sounds very different than before .
he was already over sixth grade .
i started an institutional .
they even get funding with a cup .
the film hasn &apos;t been rejected yet .
we need to think about what marks are .
what do you do with this ? &quot;
i call that the end of the puzzle .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 .
it &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
this is ideology , not science .
and that brought me through ...
today , 6.8 billion people live .
just like that , that &apos;s how it gets .
it &apos;s busy making sense .
the hot project today is today .
automatically runs to the right thought .
that &apos;s how natural things are presented .
but it requires a lot of planning .
we can reinvent everything even more .
as we think of north .
and that depends on phosphorus .
often in the third , again , forget .
it &apos;s longer than those other two networks .
the stones are colored .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
it &apos;s about changing values .
i started with my usual talk .
this is a very sensitive question .
i learned this from my grandmother .
now we &apos;re going to do this with airplanes .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
we have not written this app .
and every morning i jump .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
they &apos;re very good .
which words would you describe ?
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
there are also worlds .
to ask , what &apos;s the right ?
in the people about the urine .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes .
the living fears are the spirits .
they gave their blood pressure up .
thank you , but the best part is coming .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
happy productivity . fantastic !
the result of that was catastrophic .
and everybody in this room has to be in there .
here &apos;s the olive oil .
bjelln villages .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
risk is not a simple game .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
we already have a lot of procedure .
this may be publicly available here .
my brother was staring at me .
this is the apapple saras .
i talked a lot about magic .
who could have looked at this ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who do you really want to inform ?
completely focused on a particular goal .
what do you think happens next ?
they have them . they always have them .
so that &apos;s a hard nourn .
it &apos;s constant .
they literally exposed the pile .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll tell me .
most of all , when he died .
so there are two circles .
the side product is clean water .
that sounds unusual for the first time .
we built unique elements here .
you always lose rare animals .
she &apos;s going to touch her deeply .
he died , broken through the story .
here you can see the building works .
they drifted each other .
say what you feel .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
let &apos;s do a little intersection .
here you have this little mechanism .
there it &apos;s melted .
the interest is interested in firefighters .
the question is , what &apos;s going on now ?
the students are divided for grades .
these things are logical correctly .
and here you feel it .
and for energy , i noticed this .
i &apos;ve tried to understand them .
all of these generations require only a few milliseconds .
and it seems to me , no one seems to be in the rain .
that i had written these crazy things .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
this is just a little less destruction .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t matter .
this is also a paradigm shift .
a dalmaink , exactly .
you see the first time from the back .
so from modern modern society .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
we have to come far , and we have to get fast .
it &apos;s a new care of america .
they &apos;re all longevity questions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they &apos;re the hot countries of somebody .
we &apos;re running through initiational rituals .
now look at these curve .
vitant belongs are easy to our lives .
i represented people in death cells .
they were inspired to be inspired by this .
there may be some mutations .
so scott gets this fruit .
we worked up to the night .
so i followed my gut feeling .
he moved back to the silence .
now we saw the reverse effect .
polite has all the applause .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
so ... meaning , not so optimistic .
he switches the pulse .
let &apos;s start with the true one .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
they had a concept of blue blood .
i believed , everybody could do that .
i never met him personally .
even cats look at this video .
there was jimmy .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
how would you describe your brand ?
we &apos;re talking about kitchen , fresh .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
no , that was what i thought .
i &apos;m a redundant person .
this is usually not the route .
this is a painting of a circle .
the roof was also covered with water .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
and women argued the successful .
we can support them , be good .
look at what it does .
the main man winds me .
sexual breeze is going to the picture .
i read you the entrance .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
that &apos;s the truth . i believe .
we &apos;re talking about twenty-five of them .
it was really imperative .
he shaped his head , no .
this is going to happen in april next april .
we also have very accurate data .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but with the right design , please .
we can support them , be good .
to say , what is information ?
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
there was never a time before .
and even lomg thinks about it .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
also , these sources are understandable .
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
this is an ecological network .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
the chef had coined him .
you &apos;re going to be like this .
this is such a trajectory .
that &apos;s what &apos;s just been represented .
what does five million-milliseconds do ?
i see the dalmaink .
it might take until it &apos;s invited .
maybe you have to look back again .
no , no , no .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
156 nations send our television channel .
they tap their internet connection .
but today we are far beyond that .
she wasn &apos;t yet drunk .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
this is the system we live in .
but i was continuing to ask these questions .
and that was what i felt .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
you should also have the wishes .
something very strange happens here .
and that was the outbreak of the break .
i &apos;ve learned a few simple things .
it can know how we hold it .
so it creates a recovery .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
this is a modest little app .
the ufer comes from another place .
&quot; they didn &apos;t let them go . &quot;
i lived in parallel worlds .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and i &apos;d like to read you the preferences .
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
you can be logical and intuitively .
tell me a little bit about this part .
make it possible -- all of you here .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
anyone still know what that is ?
so this is the reason for this project .
it &apos;s called &quot; i jump with me . &quot;
let me tell you a little bit about it .
these kind of conditions don &apos;t exist with us .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
we can give ourselves something like this .
so the first exciting primate .
and there &apos;s some collaborative staff .
daniel kahneman : sure .
everybody would like to make people happier .
also , the dosization plays a role .
and why ? fast food changed .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
we now have masses in this country .
not the truth is it gets free .
because now you can apply a three-sentence .
you see the tiles up there .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
we don &apos;t know exactly why that happens .
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
thank you , danny kahneman .
we get an absolutely flat line .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t .
they change the process , they understand it .
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
and then what do you do with the trash ?
bad ? i was completely confused .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and then he can just walk away .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
his personal nuances of the seaerotic .
i &apos;m trying to do that for a moment .
it just has to work as a present .
but we start to see change .
this is a year of water flow .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
it &apos;s a little virus of bacteria .
now this level of intuition is going to be very important .
so littlegendary resource is open .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
they grow five inches .
maybe i did it with a good reason .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
let &apos;s get something else out .
it comes out of our own bags .
normal people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
as an artist , i think of a very important thing .
here you see roberto dance .
and no matter , italy won the end .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
but the game is a format .
thank you . i have a question to you .
he &apos;d had 20 minutes of the music .
now , i &apos;m going to show you .
this is just an insurance method .
it should contain the two elements .
shake the environment , make less trash .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to talk about .
yeah . she doesn &apos;t do anything else .
the goal of the film is transparency .
a language is expression of human mind .
it was a zacle .
what you need is a new medical culture .
alone , shame and without support .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
i think our identity is threatened .
many of my mandela are very young .
my cousins are around everywhere .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing presentations .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
here are two different jewels .
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i have him on my laptop here . &quot;
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist .
a whole cool thing .
the difference will be perceived as loss .
in two hours , they &apos;re building anywhere .
the emergency room did all the strands .
no insurance can be made .
there &apos;s a lot of great books on this issue .
so this was a problem for supercomputers .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
you can predict that . why is this going ?
what kind of application i do ?
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
isn &apos;t half or a quarter ? &quot;
so what can we conclude from all of this ?
so basically a translation of translation .
no tree is carbon neutral .
and further , now you see him .
the next step was happening in this communities .
he had invited a lot of natural videos .
this is actually just the labor .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
that really solves the fuel problem .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
this is a part of her .
it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
in other areas -- the world of communication .
this is my supermarket . no big market .
but west governments are helping themselves .
sleeping is ubiquitous .
i &apos;m going to be tired of how we all do .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
if you burn charcoal , no .
say , there &apos;s no predictable .
can you play me now in blue ?
no , we find what &apos;s inside .
and there &apos;s a central point here .
you know , everybody &apos;s eating copper .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
now what are archaedy models ?
and the list can continue .
so , that was my primary motivation .
providing america . find out more .
and the problem is not the technology .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we asked about it , and nobody knew it .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s sort of shrinking us .
and then it looks like this .
do you remember the wines again ?
so , help me a little bit about it .
imagine mozart efficiency .
i &apos;m happy that i &apos;m there .
the water quantities have increased .
they &apos;re concerned about the worse .
man three : i &apos;m the museum guy .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a lipper .
in between , the instruments have evolved .
i want to explain that for a minute .
actually , a patient didn &apos;t want to make a viral video .
in this sentence , three sentences come in front of you .
now , three sentence , they &apos;re still out of school .
you can zoom in very easily and zoom out .
now i add a bass .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
if not , equals somebody else today .
this is the machine below the gene .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
they laughed more than they do here .
your problem is that you have too little .
three : escalation of expectations .
the official dogma of what ?
you just hear and then start talking .
let me show you how they work .
it &apos;s a game called the following .
i call them the income billion .
we &apos;re thinking of energy today .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
you go around and wash up .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
that means something built in the city .
second time . at the very normal time .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
just imagine that for a moment .
raise your hands . let me see you .
maybe we can see violin as change .
dumb is not much better .
people killed . people were struggling .
and let them start with an example .
you know that science is not a company .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so , that really carried me .
i tried to preserve the body .
life had not changed since centuries .
but that &apos;s how many people got aid over the years .
my grandmother never forgotten me his life .
my fourth technique : predict for complexity .
third technique : categorization .
it captures a thousand square miles .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
you want to tell me something about my brand .
it was something that we knew about doing .
but reality is always unpredictable .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
thursday : self-trust is the key .
they are in the back part of our body .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
i wanted to rebuild health after a disease .
now , if you think about a piece of paper .
what ? that really made me out .
we refused with fast food .
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
we forced them . puff .
my parents are 80 on the ferry .
and there &apos;s the lake problem .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drink in information . &quot;
you can jump directly to a certain output .
you can dive into a particular year .
because this is what it is , isn &apos;t it ?
shaking the environment , needs less energy .
this is something called osia model .
now you see the dalmatiner .
and the two more recently are here today .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
this one has to be at the bottom , down to zero .
but i didn &apos;t let myself discourage .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
and in time , they can react to others .
our goal was easy to say , okay .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go again .
everything about it is compound .
it &apos;s all in it , it &apos;s useful .
this is compared to china in a second .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
anyway , they do it in there .
the permanent ice is marked with red .
and if you don &apos;t , don &apos;t dance your dance .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
seriously -- the undergoing !
well , this cartoon makes some exceptions .
here &apos;s a couple on the hampton .
so this is how the supermarket is .
i thought i could integrate myself .
we still think they &apos;re originally originally .
the three words laugh : remember ?
i remember it was yesterday .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
well , i joined the courts .
i said , &quot; ok , oma . &quot;
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition dot .
i work in the solar technology industry .
and let me show you a simple example .
but it has an unexpected twist .
so that made sense , it would fit together .
yet , we seem to be very satisfied with this .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
scott was subsequent to human beings .
and here &apos;s each piece very well planned .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
is it about the details or the colors ?
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
no one has to give away ideas .
motors , motors -- four possibilities .
i think maybe i &apos;ve heard more hands .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
eeeeee ! no , thank you .
and this is a millionaire .
so this is where we need digital security systems .
so again , the passage really well .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
sexual activity comes in many different forms .
so they get rid of them ; they save the shoes .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
what we want to do is create the future .
i &apos;m not going to live in the real life of this feedback .
there &apos;s a lot of happy coaching .
so let me show you this close .
it &apos;s like a potato .
shame . complaining .
we got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
they were just like the people in this room .
my grandparents would push this number down to 70 .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
we need to use more research for more research .
there &apos;s every footprint .
i would usually take the needle out .
there &apos;s somebody sitting in the back who had no childhood .
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
let &apos;s do this as if we had a machine here .
what happened to these design students ?
this is going to be a key element of this stuff .
they live with chemosynthesis .
i was totally enthusiastic , you know .
i &apos;m going to choose the subject of the government .
and every evening , they fly 240 miles back .
every morning , they fly 240 miles to farm .
how is the feeding ? &quot;
natural light then offers smarter .
that &apos;s not what nobody else did in the world .
picasso said , you just wait .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
that the theme of ecology is a global one .
now , i &apos;m going to do something else .
they &apos;re all going back to their way .
and they had to remove what we did .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we just signed up .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
so you can &apos;t put them wrong .
what do you do with certificate ?
this is alfred rough alez .
there can be a series of changes .
and this is very important in medical research .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for this .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
then he whispered me to the ear .
the rest of the time are delay .
i start with some simple examples .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
the question is why people accept that .
and i went back to work .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silicon .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
and then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
first of all , i thought this would be a game .
the storytelling is always needed more senses .
and trying to do the whole thing again with another generation .
today , a lot of people gave the government .
next week , this is coming up to the market .
it has a button , it &apos;s got a button .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the prevention .
the first is a classic , apple .
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
these things have a positive effect .
no one wanted to do something with the film .
what do you think the answer will be ?
on the left , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s why i think we have to be leaders .
so we have this terrible simplistic idea .
so two pairs , each parent is a baby .
ladies and gentlemen , their relations .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
it was a leg beyond the imagination .
the best part is coming -- in a second .
so every concert is a different concert .
so not saving , promised , avoid .
and everything is suspicious or content .
i could go right in front of my house . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
they &apos;re supporting other people &apos;s mistakes .
i made them and made me treat the treatment .
you know how to call a 4,000-odd ?
notice two things about this curve .
and i have to say , there was power to me .
my mother was the youngest of her kids .
at 16 , i started illustrating books .
that our contribution to the system is choose .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
he &apos;s not out in other countries .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
i never want to live anything different in life .
so i was talking a few months later at a conference .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- that &apos;s how their fingers walk along .
i want to show you something very first .
and of course , it did , but then click click .
it was summer , and i had a root .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
and they &apos;re not only going to die on masses .
what happened is that we could do that .
they don &apos;t spend time in power floods .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put it up .
these are absolutely logical and correct .
anyway , that &apos;s what i want to do .
technical circles are the same .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for 9 .
i put it in particular .
at the beginning , the tribal society is through language .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
so it &apos;s supposed to get from outside to people .
we don &apos;t have identity , we invent them .
it was a lot less , and i was in eighth .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
now everybody &apos;s trying to see from this pattern a little bit .
he came up to me and he hugged me .
all of them were so they started to share .
but it &apos;s definitely not a optimal situation .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you do it crazy ?
the country on the land would roll it .
so smarter , a giant issue everywhere .
and we want to make this material available for all of us .
i &apos;ve learned very simple things in my work in my work .
we want to do something against death penalty companies .
there &apos;s a couple of really interesting developments .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet , a realistic level .
so the theme of the day : saving save .
actually no , that was not the mistake at all .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
and we need to improve a lot more on this device .
it happened four and a half years ago in italy .
and i would argue that this is good .
this is a problem that many players have .
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve been summarized .
instead , we &apos;re looking at the ecological model .
memory down these , triggering the rest .
and that &apos;s what these guys have done .
well , what is the brand gerry ?
i want to help you calm down .
both of them are survival , both of them .
as i said , amanda contributes our election .
there were no cancers .
have you taken every morning all your vitamins ?
so this was a very strange experience .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
all the wind is going down to almost like that .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
the only thing they had was their head .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
this is a dead turtle .
so i think this is my brand .
i &apos;ve got something that i want to show you .
how would it be longer to live in good health ?
we don &apos;t want companies to patent out .
and that &apos;s what i found .
they have reversed the flow of the water .
so , we can &apos;t help these things .
in the countries where people come to money .
and what does it look like in there ?
we understood that weather is global .
and in this head , remembering memory .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is an entirely unhalable pattern .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
everybody in my manhattan &apos;s neighborhood is away .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
well , would you choose the same vacation ?
there seems to be a disagreement .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
now she understood the advantage of the prototype .
this is the u.s. for hundreds of years .
i think the first place is the curiosity .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
but maybe you can still agree with them .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
not all , of course , should be compound .
if you fall in love , efficient ?
and we see that it goes through .
because we don &apos;t feel effective money .
yeah , so what to be biohacking ?
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
the fact is , coal is not dirty .
there are the ones that are much more spatial .
the corporate headquarters is right here .
at one point , i thought he would have kidney stones .
and to give back to my upper doctor .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
we want the number of crops .
the swiss is oconcrete .
the dna of dna was an interesting step .
people seem to think politics , politics is sexy .
but what happens to people &apos;s research is different .
i was not familiar with the label .
no apple ever looked like this .
good night , sweet thylacines . &quot;
now he &apos;s getting a tractor in the scene .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and their movements .
if your job is dance , dance .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnet .
this is footage of a six seconds .
but there &apos;s not always such a bad thing .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
they &apos;re getting rare because we &apos;re going to catch them .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of progress .
all of these are errors .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
i remember it was yesterday .
and i &apos;m going to get a figure out of the book .
tell , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
so each one was a little different .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
i put my job in 95 .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
we realized that it &apos;s really weird .
they wanted to have nothing to do with the project .
the answer is probably going to be &quot; no . &quot;
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
because otherwise our problem is even bigger .
this is something like our campi .
so that you can remove the whole movement .
here are the results we just got .
but how do you do that in practice ?
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
i want to reach it by not dying . &quot;
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
that &apos;s not how happy a person lives .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
... that also , you know , play a role .
probably many of you here in the room know this trick .
yeah , they &apos;re right . we &apos;re going to fix that .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
and why ? because paul vaccine made a vaccine .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
well , i understand that . i do .
the marshmallow needs to be on top .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
think about how to measure our success .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
these blocks don &apos;t bring us money .
i can put the sequence around you .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
for nathaniel , music means elite health .
well , we have a business model .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
because , in fact , this person is not interested in evidence .
because we can &apos;t live without these lifespan .
he &apos;s just faking them and not himself .
why do i have to afford that little car ?
a phrase with his own attitude .
the interpretation is hardly spoken in the early class .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
and in my adolescence , i said , expectation .
it &apos;s kind of like an act of poop .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say that .
or they didn &apos;t have any photophoto gray .
and this brings us to a big question .
it &apos;s virtual reality , and it &apos;s not a computer .
yes , what do we do for projects now ?
and the world in which we lived like this .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
if you put it together , this is what happens .
and that was not too hard to diagnose diagnoses .
i was a twenty-obsessible student .
well , really good , maybe a all-star .
wealth , not debt , affects the outcome .
she had the last word in any family argument .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we use this word with such rape .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and that worked . applause for scott .
i made the decision to go to the united states .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
2010 , 23 million times had been looked at it .
and that was an experience in decourage for me .
and finally , we should get transparency .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
or are they more like a downtown ?
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
so what are we going to see in the movie ?
you know , i had the idea for a film .
i want to tell you how we found that .
and that &apos;s the planning behind it .
i learned that in a moment , everything else is different .
every icberg has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature &apos;s nature .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
it &apos;s natance , and it &apos;s just natance .
we have the passion of a dictionary innovators .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
we want to create mass incentives . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i want to talk about the power of identity .
now we &apos;re going to do this with drillers and machines .
this is the call center for service and information .
and we want to put this on a global scale .
we have all the navigation systems in our cars .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
all right , let me show you a little bit more of this .
here we were , and this is the painting .
emc says , &quot; you &apos;re going to get transparency . &quot;
there was a lot of crazy things going on .
from the bird age to machine age .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same with the disability movement .
but will we make the best part of our game ?
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
but one of them is much worse than the other .
but you know what they don &apos;t have right ?
i thought we &apos;re going to get the poker .
there is a connection , a mutual respect .
and so i then met a slightly unusual decision .
so my two passions flew around .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
i don &apos;t know who knows this picture .
i &apos;m just going to agree , that &apos;s logical .
it seems to me that it &apos;s important to negotiate .
the question of death penalty is an interesting question .
the child in me is really excited about these possibilities .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamics .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
today , i &apos;m going to report unexpected discoveries .
the underwater part comes from a stone breakdown .
when i say reality , i &apos;m talking about photo-reality .
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
and how was that for you ? what was it successful ?
a little bit more about them , they &apos;re not .
it was &quot; in eternal , forever . &quot;
tuesday : adaptability will be totally overwhelmed .
the dog ! i was linguistic .
do you want to be attractive and self-conscious ?
she didn &apos;t breathe , and she was blue .
the people in the side are coming in now .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and some of it doesn &apos;t work and mankind .
so we &apos;re running away from it , and where do we walk ?
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
but the phosphorus will not be able to replace .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
we wanted to develop a learning learned for language .
i may have another 40 years of work in me .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
if you want to create hyperlinks between the images .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not perceived as big loss .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
this is the kind of curriculum .
now there &apos;s also a whole bunch of studies .
and we &apos;re learning trust and the rules of play .
probably one of those numbers has to get very close to zero .
and i said , &quot; yeah , very much like . &quot;
you can tell things here , the world &apos;s influence .
... can you just show the slide .
that &apos;s the same thing , i think we &apos;re going to do today .
in each of those five areas , we need at least 100 people .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the need to be the assistance .
and i went over and i just stopped .
it also shows itself in other places .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
these results were achieved by several weeks of hard work .
this player is about a episode for a moment .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
there &apos;s a program that maybe some of you know .
i &apos;m very grateful for the gratitude here .
you know , he was in 1835 here .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of that yet .
my mother lifted on the boat from the boat .
these are the people who shape my view of the world .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the borders .
we see this in all sorts of different areas of human life .
and the same thing was after the three months .
it &apos;s right , morality , patents .
the main problem here is as similar to aids .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter about reality .
you have a nice example of this .
then i say , heart sorry , yes ?
and we are often reinventing ourselves as we want .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re going to bring children to the world .
his biology process has changed after that .
i said , &quot; promises , oma . &quot;
it &apos;s verile and strange programs .
the politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
there are some places that we can apply .
we called it the digital water water of civil lion .
because they have special skills of processing .
so here are some natural light bulbs .
the second factor is the service we use .
it changed my way to make films completely .
it &apos;s hard to translate the destruction .
so you could probably feel to sell it .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
that means the ants weigh much more than we do .
and we can now look at this .
gew and queuard cohen .
so , pull them off and start inventing them .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
that &apos;s an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
imagine only two other small changes .
how many would you choose a good memory ?
and this is like the sound of the message .
so please stop playing if a music is played .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what &apos;s true .
the first two sentences are logical correct .
in fact , we know that something else is the case .
now , this should not be a joke at all .
do that once again and then you experience the sentence .
we can do these things on different examples .
what we love is , what is the excavary .
they moved to a natural concept .
so these women were wearing themselves , and they just sat down .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and we created an ipad apple app .
darn and sponsors have been considered .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzles .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you zoomed in . you can really go into it .
you can see in all these museums there .
how much money is going to take care of that ?
think about it . this attack is generic .
and if it doesn &apos;t , it doesn &apos;t do anything .
so we start with a wind drum .
he says , &quot; make a conversation for the conversation . &quot;
imagine a soundtrack airplane .
it &apos;s a totally denial of errors .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to develop .
this is another view of life on the tree of life .
they shared the kingdom in two weeks .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
we didn &apos;t have a child in this country yesterday .
and i need a while to figure this out .
we repeated this practice with the same students .
you have to be willing to take these risks on you .
&quot; look at your legs , pink .
there &apos;s no overwhelmingly population problems .
then you &apos;ll notice that it has given a change .
and the third area that explains itself is actually from itself .
i &apos;m looking forward to the conversations with you all !
every big picture is the beginning of a disk .
you wouldn &apos;t be hungry , and you know what ?
or are they more like a downtown ?
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to ask ourselves .
in fact , it &apos;s much dangerous and aggressive .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
game is the one that holds us .
if you have to give something , give it right now .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
they teach them to open doors .
antony : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
and here are two patients . these are their records .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trajectory .
i think that &apos;s true for everyone on the planet .
those who make the scientific arguments are very little .
so , climate change is going to be a climate change .
i &apos;ll just show you the new york times website .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as designers .
sauce coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
it grows in the winter and shrinking in summer .
not just bad , but the worst time of all time .
everybody knew her genius was a little bit lam .
we reconcile them , repair them .
and the world in which we now see life looks like this .
but these are all streets in the u.s. s.a .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
child mortality is about a tenth .
this is also where that comes back .
now , manifesto is something that is half a billion people eat .
she &apos;s not even an idea ; she &apos;s a process .
and you know what my response to all of this is ?
we walk into the poor of the placebo industry .
in nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
where &apos;s the biggest interest , what &apos;s really going on ?
also , the energy source is very important for them .
we went back to the titanic of titanic .
because artists have a broad relationship to lie .
and at all , you did a lot less than i do .
or b , because you don &apos;t learn to sing ?
i &apos;m never going to play more like that moment .
it &apos;s the form of refour-fourth behavior , yes ?
and less useless or friendly friendly , it is .
how can i make something that i can do ?
i don &apos;t see why it should be that way .
so how do we work if we look in there ?
every society is pretended by a primate medium .
and these interactive portraits are true to each other .
we &apos;re now focusing on the greenhouse generation .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built watermarks .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
they get a model that comes out of the whole earth .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
so in other words , i first want to define what i want .
and i see the same process combined by photos .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it became almost 200 million times a year .
they had 348 different kinds of marmelade .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
he described one of them as very ordinary .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
at one point , the screen is filled with leaves .
so , the shooting ecology movement has done it .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
this year , almost 50 million times .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
we should put the baker in the cage .
are you eight and monkeys like 2,000 ?
the life itself has no voice in this choice .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
and in the world , everything made sense to me .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
dane , in a moment , the head of the head .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
so gender can come up in many different varieties .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s being raised as a girl .
and no , it &apos;s not muslim or san francisco .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open doors ?
here &apos;s the current version of this one-year .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
and that was the first of people developed playful devices .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
you never get a job that you can &apos;t solve .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen so rare lines .
i take that hand away . and here &apos;s the diameter .
and the film is called &quot; the cardiovascular . &quot;
well , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
well , we introduced the mayor .
now , today , we know everything about where things come from .
france makes a tor . italy makes a gate .
how do you urge people because of their characteristics ?
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressive aggressive .
it stays out every fifth hope from my consciousness .
is it true for others , or is it true to us ?
so i say , let &apos;s start the world changing games !
edward caova is a volational scientist .
we currently spend three billion hours a week playing online .
the biggest difference between them is the transition with time .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of the automation .
bg : an energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t tell you yourself .
with pies , you can dive them into a decade .
but for many people , that &apos;s a little bit radical .
so i canned in my life a lot of fish .
i understood that this is exactly the nature of art .
in fact , the notes are very vague and unprecisely .
because we &apos;re not doing things free .
there it &apos;s going to be more like my glasses .
as i said , there &apos;s only a second thing to do .
this is an interactive filming footprint .
and carolina ! depressed for you in spiritual .
i &apos;m still going to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and everybody knew it worked like that , right ?
i &apos;d rather continue to do this work that i love .
and the question is , is that good news or bad news ?
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
here it says , &quot; take your fingers on any light . &quot;
the next step was to find the apps for this .
we still know one where all the twels are .
so you &apos;re just going to go to google projection project .
which other metamorphobic have they run through ?
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brand .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money looking good .
this constant feedback doesn &apos;t exist in real life .
i &apos;m going to take it out for you and then explain it .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
a research mester at the theme of user interface .
i &apos;m also going to solve what &apos;s in there .
you don &apos;t know anything in this goldfish glass . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great things .
in the future , most crime will play online .
we had no words for what we started there .
now he &apos;s standing on the red list of dangerous species .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
but i really think that after us there &apos;s something else .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
the cellular communities began to abstract information again .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital physical .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacine .
&quot; don &apos;t &quot; get it wrong .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the brick .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together .
again , urban designers and construction are very interested .
there &apos;s not even online . there &apos;s no stretch .
that doesn &apos;t work at all for memory itself .
our steps in the digitization of life were exponentially .
this is star night , probably never seen before .
over the course of this journey , i learned a lot .
as a child , i was constantly drawing comic books and so .
when we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
right now , this is our goal .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
we were just around there as well as otherwise .
many people talk about 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
i was very interested in exploring the deep sea .
so when it comes out , there &apos;s no soul .
this is the most difficult part in my talk .
i can &apos;t play as much as in 20 years .
both cases of me , questioned me .
so much testosterone , but no reaction to that .
so growth rate itself is accelerating .
i &apos;m just going to keep the diameter in my hands .
1m is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
that &apos;s why the weighs to think about the weighs .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
now , how do people die in such a hack ?
the first story is from charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and you can see this green point there in the middle .
i sell smart museum in the entire country , worldwide .
this is my meat , and i can turn this around .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
no , the throwing is exactly the right , yes ?
many of you are covered by facial expressions .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
in both cases , surgery was operated , and it was very good at them .
she didn &apos;t have a treatment of brain damage .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
and the fish also had the happiness to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
it was the lack of trajectory against drugs .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
there &apos;s more dawn behind it , it &apos;s still deeper .
but we just know a little bit about where things go .
ok , imagine how extreme self-assembly motivates .
i know what people think when you see that .
ask , ask the evidence , demand , demand them .
i said , &quot; chicken chase ? &quot;
everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
as it used to the village on the village .
this is what happens to be the nanny machine age .
in fact , there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
they put them on the support machine .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental disorder .
she was able to take a time learner &apos;s learning currency .
... the crowdsource of crowd-sourcing .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
i &apos;ve been working in a cook mining work -- dangerous .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there &apos;s the shame he and he said , right ?
this is what goes back to the criminal marks .
so , like a human being is about certain things .
and of course , how design impact on perception .
it &apos;s a disaster for the bottom two billion , but it &apos;s a disaster .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
lawyer : i &apos;m a lawyer .
we have a abstract abstract language .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
but it was actually a bigger one night in this night .
we had to worry about the lawyers of lawyers .
it was called the automatic stone .
genotar is a certificate place .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to do ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
they slow down to one of our big problems .
we see the process that &apos;s feeding itself .
thylacine ? yes . alive ? yold .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we &apos;re doing .
but you can combine something special like this .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
because the images of livestock for you to recommend it .
tell , and wum , you &apos;re in this museum .
the idea is to overwhelm a digital security system .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and this is actually a conservative estimate .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain him .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphor .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy progress .
this was not a film , no hd , that was real .
i was there not a long time ago with miguel .
because you know , that &apos;s a fun process .
have you seen a cliff tree ?
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i just described .
if you get far away , go together . &quot;
providing america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
frost , the carbon man will clean up every day .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
so i &apos;m going to step back and look at the other way .
i filmed in war areas -- difficult and dangerous .
so we should soon find out what the goal is .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
when we build cities , this is actually a big thing .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
in other words , game is our adaptation .
can you imagine something good that comes from tabak ?
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
you can just call some names , and people will understand it .
diphere , turin , child paralysis ...
this is a variation of one thing that was made .
well , the energy episode is over time .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
it caused immense jews in the control space .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s this contribution , it &apos;s coincidence .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
and this is how he &apos;s running his elderly .
and then there &apos;s a whole lot of simulations .
but it wasn &apos;t that much of the day .
because the musician of kindness is the extension of our body .
he just lived out of ninety-three years .
hey , puma , do you really serious ?
a baby needs about a sixth of wind .
so i know of some of you who don &apos;t have to wear .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here to here .
it &apos;s like asking someone to beat the sun .
please follow me , because the circle will come back .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
this is an iconic debate . she has to stop .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la la palma .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
i &apos;ve got a friend who &apos;s going to do a passeri .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound tape .
and because we &apos;re older , we &apos;re going to get the wind bigger .
this is the period of time when you fall in love .
and today , we &apos;re still very , very strong stories .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and the predictions of how you read them are serious .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change .
it &apos;s also my big , long life love and fascination .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
why are they going to be able to buy us if we can &apos;t buy ?
they have to admit that this is a big choice .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
a few years ago , i started to develop litting-edge .
they &apos;re still touching the broader , and they &apos;re still touching .
my grandfather was during the prohibition in prison .
she was a pocket , strong woman , she had impact .
so , in a way , the technology gives us the technique .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
but what if you want to see the paintings ?
but my logical side has not liked it .
i just want to say a little bit about salad resonance .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . heartful wish .
we also brought to design schools .
this is the simulation of the chesapeake bay .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to prepare against justice .
my uncle died at alcohol diseases .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
in fact , we &apos;re also a majority of these community .
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
let &apos;s call the animal , it costs a lot of money .
if a neighbor helps the other , we strengthening our communities .
ohhhhh , wowwww !
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing regalvants .
50 percent of their decisions have been made within nine minutes or less .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and my talk today is mostly going to act of these cognitive biases .
well , sometimes i play with them , but not very often .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
open up the map , jump with a click .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a whole lot of transparency right now .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
you could also use ordinary design -- using technology to spread .
one of my friends did it -- richard bingle carries .
imagine these points could really start to fly .
i like to say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
these are the kinds of questions that we &apos;re going to have to face .
i was fascinated by the elephant and beauty of biology .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
and that &apos;s an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
i mean , how much toes are we from our memories ?
the more money you deserve satisfaction is you .
that our survival is linked to the survival of each individual .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
and yes , i have a task , like you might see .
secondly , the same photos have the same illumination .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
for example , this is somebody who &apos;s totally logical .
and i thought , &quot; moment , that sounds interesting . &quot;
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to be .
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of statements .
and the film will be &quot; the cardiovascular disease . &quot;
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
only that i think it &apos;s more like him , not true .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy it . thank you very much .
it turns out that this is not all yet .
i mean , we ask ourselves : why do we fight that ?
these are a lot of towel through masses , 20 an hour .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my death row .
because they &apos;re the ones who are also experts for taste .
the system is so healthy , it carries the water .
i mentioned this to miel and he kidnapped .
so the shaker of the trees are also better the system . &quot;
and then i &apos;m going to come up with a moment that &apos;s unfair .
and also , what you &apos;re thinking in the mind today .
and oil is going to replace us by other energy carries .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t do it .
like algae -- and other terrible things .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
it was completely exclusive that she could fail .
so that made me really frightened , and i wanted to get more .
and immediately i see another pattern that &apos;s error .
yes , this is a lower down there .
it &apos;s not resource efficiency , it &apos;s effective .
we &apos;ve been using us now over three years .
and if possible , i will find some of the strange ones .
i now know that it was the bottom of the sea .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
i studied a woman , and she was in breathtaking .
and the time i collected more and more knowledge .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a beat 300 .
in 2010 , we had just connected under two billion people online .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our injustice system .
and the lighting tracks through the rest of the book .
&quot; because she &apos;s been holding her this morning , &quot; he said .
we have the capital of the techno-philanthropy .
this approach is true of all new things that we do creative .
since that time , we &apos;ve received all kinds of recognition .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody in this audience .
well , your life self is not going to be happier .
and the answer is really simple . they are forever .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
here &apos;s a picture of a cancer in kentucky .
he has a foreseeable of 15 .
i can tell you the changer is a man .
we &apos;ve moved to the so-called bird age before .
this is about 20 feet high altitude , like greenland .
this is the audience that we just finished recently .
somewhere here &apos;s a series of photographs -- here you are .
but if you can , if you &apos;re in a foreign .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t seem more human .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
or want to be fitter , more powerful , more force .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successfully , even though that &apos;s true .
my great-grandparents died all when they were 60 .
now , where are we going to go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
it &apos;s kind of like all of you in the pre-delusion .
and of course , it can never be in germany . &quot;
a government is absolutely necessary , but it &apos;s got to get more efficient .
and the more i was talking about , the more i should tell you .
and i celebrate , i like a little kid .
obviously that &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
if you &apos;re happy , you attract other happy people .
players are masters in spider social nets .
how can we translate these feelings from the games into reality ?
that &apos;s the same thing , the bad team under the best .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worry .
so people in the west have really been thinking about creativity in the west .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
one of the things that the telephone was never broken .
the more we can predict the structure of the structure and function .
a few months forward , and i had just forgotten everything .
even who kills someone , is not just a murder .
for example , the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
and the next interesting phase took about a billion years .
and this video was actually already in january .
each of these themes , of course , made out of many , many smaller decisions .
there &apos;s a lot more , but i &apos;m missing the time .
today , i want to tell you about circles and openings .
they interact with their environment and their experience .
this trick can lead your friends and neighbors . thank you .
you know , there was no mandarin in the paradise .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
one of the things that is beautiful is not efficient .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting about vision .
i apologize that i have to get so much off .
secondly , what economists call perceptual cost .
and i think that &apos;s what the world looks like .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
so it has nothing changed , and yet it has changed everything .
we &apos;ve just crossed the 7-billionaire brand .
then we &apos;re going to inject this analogy in the future .
so , if you could do the light again .
it was a store called the dragger &apos;s .
are you so far ? you see a little bit nervous .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
the things that are used only are going to be used in technical systems .
so the device that you can see is not working .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
they did that by serving the country .
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
welcome the fear . welcome the risk of welcome .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
there &apos;s only the second best , which is the firefight .
they can throw away from where they go and stand .
an amazing miserror . one of nine innocent innocent .
i want to share with you two , maybe three examples .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually going to be a rolling iceberg .
this is somebody who &apos;s safe from the rest of four .
we &apos;re used to doing things like linear .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black boys as mandela .
they &apos;re in there , they want to end up in the end of the gangs .
and then people could eat this , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
because this is where the actual government work is happening .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what &apos;s your feet ? &quot;
and then we started to negotiate with insulers .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
i explained what these sounds could mean .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re helping people .
but also our perception itself , as they fake us .
and other example are the ambients , intelligent systems .
how many doors have the house that they live in ?
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells even good .
i think about it , and i feel that we should teach that .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
some people were disappointed that there was no poetry .
i sent them home without speaking to my doctor .
the cost of solar energy in the last year was 50 percent .
we have to let ourselves go to the machine government .
there &apos;s a direct reverence for this .
the monkey of software takes place in the rule of a few years .
and clear , we can find fast-focused foods .
cats look at cats looking at this video .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
and what was noticed was that i needed a experts .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned language .
i just wish i could see my kids growing up .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
it has sight of life , one after another .
and i translated them to fund an expedition .
we &apos;re talking about the fluid of information overflow .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineer collective collective .
that &apos;s the first year before half of his advertising .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
so they go around and make art installations like this .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
i was shocked and shocked into the inside .
i went home with the emergency division on my way home .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
i say that because i think identity is very important .
because all of these new technologies are feeding themselves .
because their life depended on whether they did the job right .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
i knew she had come to pass .
today , we &apos;re not just looking at something , we &apos;re doing .
a typical walian mart gives you 100,000 products today .
you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is what truly amazing .
in the previous example , it was about finding single units .
he said , he didn &apos;t . he will ask questions .
so i &apos;m going to show you very carefully what i brought in .
if they didn &apos;t move anymore , you dig them down .
would you not want to make these changes in your genes ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
again , what potential is that we want to call it right now ?
i say , we are ready for our own epic game .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , two reasons .
when we looked at what we &apos;re looking at with income variation .
and this is a little bit hard to justify , i think .
there was no christmas trees . we did it all .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is mimimic .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
look at miguan , farmers like miguel .
the one farm that your animals don &apos;t feed ?
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
the words , so long his friends , spotted now .
and we found that , in fact , there was a correlation .
you know how many decisions do you make in a typical day ?
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
so the driving force is the cybersuper-superpower .
i haven &apos;t spent two years with my wife .
the pilot gave the machine to the hudson river .
the openness is , death is a part of life .
this holds us in the distance , and it keeps us evolving .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
it &apos;s about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
you see the person who wonders what &apos;s going on inside .
most of my activities , i have two hugs .
it turns out that dna synthesization is very difficult .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we think about our future as a predictable memory .
well , the memory itself is a storyteller .
what it ruined was the memories of the experience .
we &apos;re going to meet in the next few days .
there &apos;s a pro-win fear there .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
a fish go up , but also an avian reserve .
this second fish , which is a different kind of love story .
this first one , which was more like a passionate monkey .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s faked it .
because the music is a language , and a language is to communicate .
and most of all , first of all , is questions , which is the right thing .
but i &apos;m just doing it a little bit more curiosity .
i started to think , i should just impose the project .
we can first look at the waste problem .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take you away .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
just to precise time points , they agree .
if the museum gave us the picture , click on it .
so you can ask : how happy is this alive ?
most of you are completely ignored by memory .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have any consequences .
did a single audience die in the audience ever die of masses ?
it &apos;s the question of whether you can get it to zero .
you can test it to my talk in your immune system .
but , of course , the sum is very , very diverse ideas .
and she asked him what are your hobbies ?
so , in each store , you can get the things back .
so the question is , how do we deal with these windmills ?
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
so , for example , shaking the environment , less car .
and the lives lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
so if i put them next to each other , the interest is your interest .
am i looking at this as if i could just write a song ?
she said it would be like a donnist out of the air .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious to look at what we need .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
they add a blue one to a green one , and they can make light .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast .
yet , we still get to the galapagos islands .
more and more people came in because they were angry .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
we have a lot of cells that are not on themselves alone .
you make the mistake now , and you pay very much later .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call offices .
but where would the next aed to help this patient ?
you have to make 62 different decisions to design your car completely .
well , don &apos;t get me wrong , it wasn &apos;t that easy .
almost as if we prepared our lives for a long time .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego space .
i was the only one who could talk to the airplanes .
so the records were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
think of this as a point of view , as a flying point .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
this is an amazing adventure that &apos;s going on .
this is going to affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
we found that in terms of the happiness of living self .
they evaporate their judgment . they never do it .
usually most people start to orient themselves to the task .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
if you walk , yes , everybody destroys footprint the ground .
when we overdo it , we can reject a little bit .
the most powerful climbing workers is the head of massey power .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a book .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be even worse .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
because in the marine protected areas , we basically represent the past .
i want to close with a story that really got me excited .
sometimes i lose the balance . a story to end .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
so now we &apos;ve removed the time scale .
so today , evolution can happen in the time of microseconds .
this is a rare glimpse .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
we could reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
autocolors , outside the car -- i have 56 options .
they don &apos;t even come from the museums .
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
i really like your way , sergey . now .
i became a miraculous part of this day not to die .
it &apos;s called eyeyemen , and you can see the description .
this is the average size of a greenland iceberg .
i mean , what does somebody do with so many outcomes ?
and as a general term , we can use the word sexual activity .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
we all have to believe in the last thing that we can &apos;t see .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , it &apos;s called miguel .
because he doesn &apos;t know where to go to the pile .
then the same thing happens in a good conversation .
i have to tell you , i think this was a big mistake .
we take pictures of these minimal buttons into detectors .
economists call this a paralleon improvement .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
we can shift from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
this is a whole book , an example of non-visual data .
and of course , we share all the same adaptation .
and that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s happening in the fence of inotar .
there are cases of cases like inotype .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just coming out of our heads .
i want to help you a very particular aspect of curiosity .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
ceos is a little bit through average . but here &apos;s what &apos;s interesting .
because even though he &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concern .
here &apos;s one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
this deputy ranger ran over the older black .
but i don &apos;t know how emitting people are going to be .
you go around the block and you take it as an openness .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back into the temple room .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees of our next living relatives .
the first of these fall is a contradiction , to give complexity .
they invest a lot of their time in the assembly of structures .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , as little as it is supported .
usually you &apos;re just wrong and some of them , others don &apos;t come .
now he mentioned the mineral need of physical lankton .
i take the breathing to do , consciously , consciously unconsciously .
they feel that &apos;s the real truth behind the origins .
but the question i want to throw up is : why not ?
and the best part of this is perhaps what we &apos;re supposed to be in health .
this is technology supporting innovation that &apos;s there today .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
wr wants to help people who have been convicted .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
how did he get to look for this particular kind of help ?
let &apos;s jump quickly to moma again , again in new york .
tempt is going to be part of the show , which is pretty driving .
we produce androgen and we talk about android genes .
and if you do it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this is scandalous , and we should be ashamed .
and this is the value of this experience , this very simple exercise .
but while they &apos;re talking to different people in the world about these opportunities .
they have a renewable energy rate of five percent today .
and they did this with what we call lead-maps .
but the key is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s just true .
so i &apos;ve been busy looking at when is natural or intuitive .
and these are just the biohacker , the individual people .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to scientific influence .
this made me feel like i wanted to exchange my jeans .
he invited the king of the dinner for dinner .
but somehow we &apos;re going to get it off this problem .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last year .
but instead of adding panic , he just stopped .
how about contributors that we can &apos;t even predict ?
if you look at the people who have to do it ...
and guess what we found in the angular code ?
imagine that every single one of people is being controlled .
okay , let me give you a little blood for you .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
new investments to create good jobs .
six : social case . 7 : 65 toss .
and i hope you will play with me like this and play with me .
that means that the players are safe from 10 strokes .
a long time ago , there was gray whales -- 500 years ago .
for many of you , you &apos;re going to say , those are crazy ! that &apos;s good .
the x-ray interpretation of a piece is this comparable .
i saw the janitors from my eye , and i looked at the janitors and i went down .
light bulbs in a glass , i always found very exciting .
so , for example , this image has about 10 billion points , i think .
so i decided to be 15 , when i was 15 , diver .
here &apos;s bigger , i &apos;m going to do something . we &apos;re looking right here at the center .
and within less years , lego moved in every household .
the judge reviews him as adults , but i see a child .
by the way , i haven &apos;t learned that in my work as a lawyer .
and i want to show you my outcome for this week .
56 percent of all nonviolent cases don &apos;t come from court .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-regret .
i asked him how to become a fish experts .
there was the nuclear research facility .
from this time , an anecdote that might be familiar with you .
it doesn &apos;t need to sing a limb or sing .
and sixty-10 seconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s a lot further back , in the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
so it &apos;s my opinion to a very healthy hack .
i think it &apos;s kind of like a shame or something like this .
it actually took two thousand really shape , which is this networks .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
so , this looks like a basketball placebo .
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i didn &apos;t have left me .
well , in fact , the number of nonviolence has not changed very much .
i ate him first in a restaurant in southern spain .
because ultimately our humanity is depending on our humanity .
it was so inspiring , so refugee .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
turned the trash tape on the side . went home .
alone this airport has a surface of 100 square kilometers .
i like things that are weird . i like special things .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
so maybe you should put a little bit of that interview in the interview . &quot;
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leaders .
here you see an excerpt from this angular code .
we &apos;ve got his bed to see it out there .
we &apos;re degrading a person who has value for our society .
we use games to get the suffering from the real world .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : it &apos;s .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
this is actually the real melting of human and machine .
a few . probably about as many creative people are here .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
they produced the highest construction in the latest time .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of tons of on the planet .
i grew up with a higher portion science fiction .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building siv av , not intensive .
so here was finally a company trying to do it right .
the component is getting more to the friend where you live together .
and i &apos;m not so sure they &apos;re really upsetting .
the interesting thing about it is , if i can make a little trip .
there was , i think , a very good code .
in fact , nasa showed that there are many of them out there .
they like to increase the paralysis and senate the satisfaction .
well , i wondered how can i really get this ?
it &apos;s an independent area . they all control mineral .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view .
somebody was crushed , and the system was fooled .
photos like this : a building downstairs a lot of riders .
the biggest fear they had pioneered , rape and death .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to figure out all of these extensions .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange road .
but this time , it &apos;s a very good meditation .
i put seven of underpants , and that &apos;s all .
but a lot of people are caught in a very strange position .
our gut is a wonderful friendly friendly environment for these bacteria .
well , the two species of self throw two terms from happiness .
well , life itself lives his life continuously .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness under research .
it &apos;s just a bold calories . it &apos;s mimic .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
ah , the majority . i like to see as a doctor .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s 2,500 years ago .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
now , what about the placebo effect ?
the smallpox . the pox killed billions of people on this planet .
it &apos;s the renewable energy , as they &apos;re often called .
this is a fish in the southwest corner .
because i &apos;m asking , how is this diagnostic diagnostic ?
the notisters have the function of the letters of a writing .
and then the laser influences of the pre-industrial cultures .
that means that you navigate across sound and about rhythm .
so this is just one application of many that you can do with it .
and then we &apos;ve done this kind of cooperative , this is how we &apos;ve done a code .
on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
should i write this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
54 percent of the deaths of death penetration .
basically , the concrete building has become our time .
as if it was with a paper , never before hearing audiences .
how can a judge turn into something that it &apos;s not ?
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lynmobs .
so , programs that can be made by the former nuclei .
for example , the fish had been recorded on a glue .
possibilities that could not have been allowed to be compressed .
so i made a couple of years ago to do that .
finally , at the end , we should get the fear of welcome .
an eighty , failed brand . how is your brand ?
why is it important to start ? what is the red ?
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely constrained by constraints .
and i said , &quot; how are you communicating ? &quot;
well , in this night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
and the key indicator for this is the extinction of languages .
and i had to explain to the journalists that there is no test for this test .
and this is called androgene receptor .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative beings , heart nature .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a ph.d. .
right now , in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about genetic food .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
so i offered a 100,000-dollar software for the winner .
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
there was no piano for time at the time when the instrument was not a piano .
you learn to find the sounds to the notes on the instrument .
even if you were to shoot yourself , you would have emissions .
most people know the most people know this from software design .
this is actually live in the internet . you can check it out .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nunavin .
but nothing was invented to let me go back to this .
and the best thing about it is that they connect with magnets together .
some of my smarter passions happened in the last five years .
i looked in the rains , and it was a little pink .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said she &apos;s in this particular pitch .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
so the dramatic numbers come to the prisoners at the prison prison .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about death penalty .
a kid in india says , &quot; today i &apos;ve seen a monkeys . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
this is my whales . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
what is the context of the thought and feelings about them ?
and if those are dangerous , then really bad things can happen .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
they talk about nature &apos;s power to tell us who we are .
if we actually don &apos;t take any phosphorus and abandon it .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the magical thing for me .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours per minute , the video is made .
if you could do it for the ones , you could also help me .
and just like that , all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
i &apos;m sad that we never know each other as adults .
think of it , it &apos;s free , nobody deserves us from it .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big thing .
and that &apos;s why , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go to the house .
if you just have one of them , it would be a very different world .
specialized skills and processing skills and their combination to success .
people here have contributed to the development of this miracle .
and somehow we need to change the change that &apos;s going on zero .
we &apos;re still finding other strange things about what their rights is .
this is the most perceptual space we have .
this is our youngest taster down there on the right .
by the end of march , the lhc will be able to be able to do it again .
and that &apos;s the message that i took in medical school .
you know how to call a 3,000-day league baseball ?
i think that in many places , the opposite of poverty is injustice .
when someone lies , it &apos;s not just a lie .
and that &apos;s why i think the ted community should be horse .
and it &apos;s spread , organic , of course .
my friends from honduras asked me to say , thank you ted .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
well , finally , the movie has a very large amount of insane .
that actually includes just a period of two and a half weeks .
these people will be connected to the film in eternal -- forever .
so all these green areas , these are the targets environments .
one is called jazz , and the other is called &quot; sally . &quot;
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of god to have lost too far .
i went to the car and was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
in the short time here , one of my very clear : ted has an identity .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good intuition to actually do the experiments .
i think , in my opinion , we have changed our world fundamentally .
this is all reality today , and the future will be much more possible .
so the interaction allows the assembly of commitment to trust , trust and each other .
here it says , the more you do , the better .
people said , &quot; do you don &apos;t have fear , never succeeded ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding to me , but i can live with it .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely unbelievable .
i love this : &quot; watson forced human enemy . &quot;
i looked at them and smiled , but she looked very serious .
three months later , i moved , and the adventure went on .
it &apos;s about creating a needle flow of goods .
i like a lot of black colors , lots of gray sound and so a stuff .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impulse for the flyside .
and the question was : how could you connect technology to the new technology ?
for example , i don &apos;t want to give you the same rights as a human being .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and that &apos;s very fast .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s concerts .
the man is supposed to be from the monkeys or a common ancestor .
loud and border , and b , etc .
how were its living conditions , how about society and politics ?
at the 10th of september year , the machine went to the first time .
we have litted kids , and they &apos;re playing with it .
and when i listened to her , she was doing keups .
and i was good , i did shame with claude .
but when i ask you , how is it about your wife ?
you collect information about the piece in the secular literature .
in between there , a lot of people are working there , and they can all be engaged .
but how would it be if the image is linked to all its images ?
you &apos;re saying that you &apos;re never going to die the names .
but she does do something that doesn &apos;t do any other government technology .
because the categories tell me how i can keep them apart .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
we should be able to eradicate everything we want .
and i tend to see wishes as my shadow .
so , hesive studies have been done to see if that agreed .
there you can see , well , there &apos;s an enormous amount of opportunity there .
the nature comes from asia , in which all of japan is japan .
because a good engineer has either built great cars or nuclear power plants .
and that was the very first beginning of a musical musical impression .
you can only have zerlemissions if you &apos;re not there .
you &apos;re going to be good . the question is how it &apos;s going to get us .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
the official belief sentence of all western industrialized societies .
&quot; do you remember the patient that they ran home ? &quot;
we live on a planet that &apos;s 70 percent covered with water .
they just dive the construction of housing against the cities .
which is that they can just get this logic wrong .
often the music class is so clear that you &apos;re only learning the notes .
that &apos;s just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
eight : tsunami warning . nine speakers : cyberattacks

you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this was so often mentioned today .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
if you turn the light , it looks like this . so just like we saw it before .
imagine the screen could just appear in different formats or sizes , in different solutions .
so i started to think what it is , what it &apos;s like to do in these games .

and this was an example that our own governments are using technology to us , the citizens , the citizens .
we want to fight prevention and discrimination in the criminal justice system .
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually recorded .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
and what we actually did , we , the humanity , is we started to abstract .
that &apos;s because the government is like a ocean , and politics are the top 15 inches .
at the end of every day , i hired a huge topg soup that we shared .
something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice , as to show this slide .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , so long they &apos;re not a particle physicist .
either , &quot; flute fusion , &quot; or a paradise , &quot; you will have the choice .
you can &apos;t just emphasize enough , how critical this factor can be for the quality of a human being .
by shaking the siblings , and it can interact with the other side of the characters .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no clue in their treatment .

in china , a post-getted chopef today , sort of , like , yes ?
it actually took some years to start with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
and the preparation were enormous . we had to build cameras and gloves and things .

so we also understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , very simple magic trick .
and so you see animals that are right next to an 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
so , in the kind of shift , the shift of evidence , they experience the great gap of lie .
now , even more sophisticated in some bottles in alaska methane , even from the water .
for her life , her life had a job : the fluid of her family and a new life in australia .

to this archaeic model , we &apos;ve heard a natural relationship with virtuality .
when i was a kid , i had collected collections of sticks , a box , a kick and bloodshed .
and so , from the interest in this technology , this technology , i &apos;m just continued to go on .
so for example , we developed a screening package , which is at room temperature .
unfortunately , not in obvious bach , but maybe you can help the fear of france a little bit .
in high school , a student said that brian goldman would learn a flower for a flower .
i &apos;m going to put myself on a statistic that i hope most of you have heard about .

you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells from your neighbor ?
this also represents the bottom of this speech , so i hope i &apos;ve had fun with you .
but in fact , my research at the university of the future is exactly the opposite of the future .
nothing migrate in my era or comes out , no trickster , and they can study everything .
and that &apos;s because these fanasts that made me crazy at all were no fanatics .
you can see it &apos;s a kind of mammals , often as &quot; migration wave reactor . &quot;
i remembered last year when i brought mosquito bed , and somehow people liked it .
it &apos;s important to the age that most of the age in the first semester , the great stages of law .

most of the mass inherent in this country was not really found in the class of massive crimes .
this reference to suggest that money is investing in more security and security and security .
police officers came in and dedicated government lawyers and bureaucrats .

our memory tells us stories , which means what we can keep from our experience is a story .
do you say that there are negative impacts to do with the clouds that have different things ?
this is actually the deadline that shows us the environmental models that we need to stop .
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need any fuel -- they have some pieces .
i &apos;m sure they &apos;re not going to teach me . in fact , they &apos;re not going to leave the glass .

evolution is all about the genome of the next generation , adaptation and generation for generation .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my physitherapy .
well , if i had ever opened the nearby 600 images in it , i would have spent another hour .
people are sitting in their beliefs , and that &apos;s what you can &apos;t get them free .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve turned it into a design workplace .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor , which seems hard to be , but maybe the one that seems to us .
here we see this again , again , again , again , again , again , the whole , single aggregating .
overview : now i &apos;m going to interact with the object , can zoom in , zoom in , zoom in .
it sounds like banal , but it &apos;s so exciting when you &apos;re getting closer .
because often people come , they can &apos;t make use of user friendship so that everyone can deal with it .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of miserable rabbit and bogness .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace that process , it will be a huge challenge .

that means we have a common ancestor , a evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , you know ? i can &apos;t remember it . &quot;
so we have the memory itself and the life itself , and they &apos;re really quite different .
unfortunately , this is the whole good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and it &apos;s often been mentioned .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much on our energy without changing its lifestyle .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got only two years later to face when we moved to california .
so , for the learning process of music , you need at least at least as long as the spoken language .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put these little pieces together , and we could correct the mistakes .
we &apos;ve done it on about a hundred genes from the 500 or so that are here .
and this really attacks these ideas on , these constraints for the possible place on the screen .
and it &apos;s decotizing to think that our species may have been there for 600,000 years .
because in this context , we &apos;re starting to understand the truly amazing things that make us do .
we &apos;ve developed an app for layar , augmented reality to find these aeds .
there &apos;s actually a corner that i &apos;m going to tell you about a knee that works on the wirelessly .
we use this great euphemism to try and error , which turns out to be meaningful .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that have happened since the start started .

the founding fathers were from my view of the original anatomic activists , and that &apos;s why .
they were playing a rock game , and they were able to break the victory for a episode .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are the success of scientific method .
it would have been without the reversal of space , but the power is so much more important .
i certainly would never achieve an alien world with a spaceship , which seemed quite unlikely to me .
we &apos;re not going to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
well , just to close , i want to realize that i talked a lot about the fathers .
who knows when the film comes out , we might see a horror volumes .
what are we going to start with the fact that we &apos;re just different from you through a few nuclei ?
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then increase my strength and permanent .
but if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to get the oil out . &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have never been able to get human potential to be available .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon , kids will die again , because that &apos;s just one question of the numbers .
in the rich world there are millions of us who are only threatened by one generation of us , hardly .
here we see a very fundamental service . is there light at home so you can read the homework ?
the greeks called these godity division of creativity monkeys .
and i find them dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to watch how it &apos;s taken to the next century .
and what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re installing an evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going on in the microbial area .
so in other words , the future is every year around a year since i &apos;m on this world .
they shoot the decision -- they shoot them , even when it comes to your own best interest .
so these things are -- you know , people remember -- this is kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
if you surround yourself with the right people , you will not only understand it , you will appreciate it too .
recently , i was talking to the oil industry , and they said they were just doing this model .
one of the ways that &apos;s particularly interesting is , and what i used in the last time , is the evolution itself .
we had a team of rocks in boston last year to program the code for programming .
so , imagine if you were to be at the same time in several places , how would that feel ?
obviously , it &apos;s with a virus that &apos;s very simple . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
so the neurons are the information employment employment that have built these cellular communities .
so , it was possible to bring us to the little digital head with the rotorial tax .
eaceacea , a small antioxium , which helps them to jump .
no , the gap that i &apos;m talking about has to do with it is fake itself .
when professors become curious , they &apos;re often shrinking up in such a research mester .
this is the machine age , and it &apos;s happened , and it &apos;s the book , and it &apos;s the photosynthetic dead .
and it &apos;s about solving a playground , creative , original , a problem .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first generation of the vibrant generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
it turns out that it actually meant to be meaningful , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do with your film . &quot;
in the moment , it was like a movie director would have gotten a bookstore .
this is like when i would say , shake your child , just three times five times .
and the most fundamental lesson that we think i &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
but there &apos;s no one that we can look around , where you learn how to make fire .
his cause to write the piece is going to always be more and more to my personal advice .
but these concepts of cyber-astonishment that will bring us back to our capabilities .
so these nights tend to survive longer and multiply in size .
and then just as simple as these words that we also use in the language of political correct correction and again .
the first example of what many of you know and some of you appreciate , very few people don &apos;t need at all .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor tells you , we could do a , or we could do b .
i want to explain to you with this mechanism today or explain something that is unfamiliar with you .
so now , i am one of my favorite pictures , serious workers from squatter brakes in the fall .
but here &apos;s the point : when you get evidence , you have to take that evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
in obvious bach , for example , the garbage is 20 percent of the trash of the coin between windmills .
but again , very rare , something special happened . one of the darkness was actually translated into the world .
my heart radar , i was shaking while i was trying to touch what was going on .
the human part of this book , far from the end , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
immediately , you &apos;re going to get one , for those of you who have these predictions , you can &apos;t prove to you .
they have reformed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that will have changed a lot of biology at some point .
and because you &apos;re obsessed with your mind , how can you be harmed ?
for these non-engineers , litted a different material , electronics was just another material .
so , what can the three billion growing , healthy , productive , productive members of the community bring us ?
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is indiscriminate , but it &apos;s also very contemporary .
and every time it divided , it turns out that there &apos;s a lot of chemicals to be undistributed .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow , to achieve a realistic result .
so i wanted to create something else , something that begins when the process gets triggered .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you put it on the triangle .
yet my interest in photography , when i received my first digital camera , at age 15 years old .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break into 20 parts , as you know it from documentary .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of my life trying to try to be myself and adapt to myself at the same time .

every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus who really have to go back into circles .
the result is that , no matter where i come from , i &apos;m going to be treated as if i was interrupted .
you can go out and create your own museum -- out of all these pictures you can put your own collection .
so , in large and all of us , we &apos;re very confident that we &apos;ve actually determined what the goal is .
well , one lighting is used to something that you find out there somewhere .
so the idea is that we actually include people with them , in which they do things together , collective .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the development department of the development department of a nonprofit organization called robin .
it &apos;s about how satisfying or enjoying the person is when this person thinks about their lives .

they lie , they surround them , they &apos;re confused , and they produce really drought .
because the soil is going to die the moose , and the wind and the water is washing the ground .
so you &apos;re just going to be replaced as citizens that are being able to deal with these technologies .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is still a little explanation of what you see .
this is one of the images that we &apos;ve seen with the so-called gapxi technology .
well , since the film was the sundancy film festival , we can look at this .
and every time i interviewed somebody , i can say , &quot; are you happy enough for this interview ?
pollinators are born as a lib of a glacier , or break it out of pollinators .
so in this project , we actually designed some little marker to track the trash as it goes through the system .
our language is impacting the social changes that have been solved in many cases by a technological change .
but danny , in the entire american aspiration , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
i know we can do it , and as far as it is me , it &apos;s something that needs the world now .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccine for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; which is a little article .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , much -- but let &apos;s see how the team is changing .
and , even though it seems really easy , it &apos;s actually hard to really hard because people are working very fast .
there are very , very few things that you can even tell from which there is a chance in a million .
and i noticed how this very profound exchange , a space mission made like this .
this was the movement . it was the legacy . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
and when i get there , with my little chv pigeon , and i &apos;m just looking at this feeling .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , you have a mosquito alone .
we made little pieces , we made an error correction , and we had a molecule of about 5,000 letters .
they found an article with false thought , they could feel the urge of this thought .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the river , as nobody could ever have predicted .
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , oma . i promise it . &quot;
i &apos;ve been trying to make sure how valuable cities are , how much value they are than they cost .
and it seemed to be preferred with these crux boxes , this real-time control system .
and you &apos;re going to give them all the nutrients that they could only wish to offer without effort .

remember , when carl sagan sagan pulled the voyada spacecraft vehicle in 1990 , when it was moved to saturn , turned back into the earth ?
and then my friends , who do little car-movies , &quot; well , how should we compete with these big , giant hollywood filters ? &quot;
what it was proved to be a nuclear concept , and she put it through a different , which was radically radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
and it &apos;s a chest , if you look in italy , like the people in the high bow in the high bow of the car out of the car .
a country has already offered its top courses to shareholders , as a dish for the decent professionals of the village system .
and i was amazed to contradict resistance , on the resistance of what was most effective in human health care in the history of humanity .
i spend most of my time comparing social weakness in social settlements and places where there &apos;s a lot of hopelessness .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every advertising that we were talking to their customers , the fingers .
they were kidding the game field and decided that anatomically , the common counts , not the differences , and that was very radical .
and at the end of the day , we really face a choice . do we want to live in a monomatic world of monotonies , or in a polymer world of diversity ?
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is going to be quantum mechanical , we had to send out all the way out .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , is the highest , not there , right ?
we have almost 20 years of digitization . when we sequenced the human-to-human genome , the change in changing from the analog world of analog biology to the digital computer in the world .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of plot , if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning , that the most extraordinary aspects of your sensation of one of you .

to give this conversation a sense of mustard , of course , i had to think of something about this remarkable faith of doudougho and voodoo , not a cult of black magic .
and because we don &apos;t care more important than our survival , the first half of all the information is a part of our temporal lobe , the ydgala .
the incredible thing to me is that the projects that i received most of the feedback , or where i had the biggest success , these are where i was interacting with things .
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend a lot of time thinking about the stuff , because if you think about the entire time , you won &apos;t listen to me .
you have to separate two things out : to be a medical fact , to be amputated and to the other social opinion about whether i am disabled or not .
the basic idea of this company was to translate the phase of analogy processes with optical vetc. etc . and begin to start with digital production .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to get the data on a usb -- like we &apos;ve seen it at stuffs .
and in this way , in fact , the critical variable variable variable that a memory of self has separated from a living self , and time has very little impact on this story .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people are filling the system with life , and when it &apos;s so , people make mistakes from time to time .
and it will allow people to measure home from home to their blood pressure to send it to their doctor and share it with others , for more than 100 dollars .
so the first case : all the nuclei of atoms are the piece of metal is still there , and at the same time the same nuclear atoms are moving up and down .
when i think about creating flow , i don &apos;t mean to create a luxury of luxury on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibilities .
but the latest evidence is that the etrometric , later the roman empire , the same dna as the old lymph .
how to increase happiness can be very different from how they think and think about remembering the memory of themselves , or whether they think of life itself .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think about a mammal -- which you dig them without the whole complex .
we &apos;re going to turn it forward , and we &apos;ll expect the first data in june or juli , and put our journey to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
we want to create the world of creating inventors , the inventors , the commitment , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , belonging us .
imagine this device in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
so one day , i decided to visit the filiters , and i asked the head , &quot; this model works , that they offer all these people all these opportunities ? &quot;
the head of the congress came up and said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
we need to take these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go up into the time machine and go to the future , we &apos;re going to be glad to be happy .
so again , i stood up with a little team on unknown terrain , and we drew &quot; avatar avatar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
and then we don &apos;t have the accident , but that &apos;s what i think , i think , has been pretty good done , which is that people are quite convinced .
i mean , it can sound strange about thinking that a thing at the same time is at two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they developed them .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all about what it takes us from &quot; uuh-oh &quot; -- to bring a &quot; ta-moment . &quot;
but the measurements were quite beautiful , and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not going to be able to do it .
i was seventh 10 when i went back to one of his courses , and i played the last of the balconies of chopchopin , in a later .
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at everything for you , everybody knew you had this physical genius that you had helped you .
on nine people that we have , come up with one that we have devastating for innocent , that has been brought out of death and from the death cell .
so an organism could learn , for example , a certain amount of fruit , because it was bad and made him sick , the last time he was eating them .
personally , i decrease . it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to have a compromise with the ideas in your head .

there &apos;s a number of people who have much more &quot; uh-uh-oh moments than others , and under the worst of these are frozen whales .
that means we &apos;re only looking at our first before we see it , again , putting it back into our zoom in to say , okay , okay .
his job is to create the conditions that are less than a billionth of a second after the universe -- and to 600 million times a second .
but they also true a secret to our future , a future where we need to adapt to increasingly challenges , through creativity and stronger surgery .
and a lot of discussions that i had in the last six years , were similar to the discussion that i had in the last three years to photovoltaics .
a sake of the pencil , if you make the full of water , it &apos;s got enough pressure , so i think , for four to six to six .
and what happened to me was something interesting about jacques cousteau from senior , the thought of an idea that was a completely unknown world here on our earth .
and our european compounds is basically just made out of louder stores of big power , where the wave is all around europe .
a process that everybody knows how everyone knows it ever tried to do something -- in other words , in fact , everyone here -- doesn &apos;t always be reasonable .
and every year , we ask the students to create products , services and services that can live within a decade of a positive life of milky way of people .
i came to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far away , but it enables the injustice .
and finally , saturday , one of my own , unique style , personal style , is a great way of telling the world a little bit about a saying without saying a word .
they didn &apos;t count because he was in love with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had to keep up .
i think that the molecular biology in general now , in general , is very general , biotechnology , everything you counted to do , synthetic biology and so on .
how about that , the interrupted , wherever they are , to give a voice to make attention to attention and change , for the first time ?
i love finding a different opportunity to find crazy outcomes , crazy outcomes , to wear , and to photograph in time , to photograph and to photograph .
i told my wife , whenever a human being used to use a moral law , because we should try to replace it through the dictionary .
and it turns out that when you make it , it makes something concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool to save the people more .
so we &apos;re not just responsible to preserve the people we love to preserve fate salts , but they also prefer to deal with it well .
so we take something very complicated , convert it into sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re involved in creating the dangers that make other people do when they get to fire .
well , in egypt , in egypt , the emergence of the april in 2011 , the headquarters of egyptian intelligence police , and they found a lot of action .
and after about a year of planning , two weeks of programming work , nuclear parties and traces made , tony recorded for the first time after seven years .
so this is what this reactor was a problem , which we fill in our fill , and that is reduced to the volume of the volume as this process .
in fact , we &apos;re going to start from a new point : we have digitization of biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into a new period of biology by building new biology and build new life .
but this is what keeps me up at night -- one of the things that kept me up at night , and we have never been so guilty of the scientific progress as well as now , never .
according to burden , the premier was the premier in january , and since -- that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million calls from this film .
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate at the moment , building coal-fired power , because we don &apos;t have any stores , or gains , because it &apos;s not going to go .
a lot of our friends thought that we were pretty stupid to do that , and that we got back and all the images on the walls would be the graffiti .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst errors have happened only five years in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues , but total nonsense .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government , the taxes and receiving .
at stanford university , when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very , very exclusive lifestyle , at least at the time , he was really smart .
in a country that has just a staircase behind the crisis , in congress , has been chosen to change this congress with 124 voice .
it seems like we were quite remote from the other parts of the life , but in fact , the biggest part is the fundamental mechanisms of our cells .
but the logic of deception allows us to do that , as if the first sentence of proposal had to be wrong as if you had to do it without the opposite .
it &apos;s still a very happy concern , if i can have the experience of experience , the piece of work that i &apos;ve been working for as long as i &apos;ve been able to experience .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up to my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to hear that way . &quot;
well , there are now marks and remarkable marks , these things that come and go , but a delay is a very strong thing .
and if you &apos;ve already gotten that the drugs of drugs are complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the users are a science of science .
if i tell you that somebody has spent eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self .
well , i &apos;ve joined some people in the company , no one could give me a relational answer , until i finally ended up with the lightning biologists .
basically , you get any round of rings on every sighted letter , and as you try to form words , these are tested about a dictionary .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little less likely to talk to you about it .
but then another one happened , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and so these cells started to communicate and share information so that communities came from cells .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference , we say , in climate .
it &apos;s starting out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see are fluid and these poems , these poems .
we have now , from our discoveries of the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me an enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more than individuals today to make us the big challenges of our planet .
so a app that is written in a couple of days , and then it spreads from rare , is a kind of shame of the bug on the institution of the government .
what that means is that if you meet somebody and you would tell them , oh , his father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about his size ?
at this point , and if you laugh , you can see how important this lie is , and how much time you need to experience something that artists can share with us very well .

and there we &apos;re going to be a cooperation at the media campus , for example , the virtual reality in our v.r.r. lab , we can actually do that all the time .
i said , &quot; well , do you know , you know , and i &apos;m both aware of these books when this book is not brilliant that it &apos;s not completely blame , right ?
because it &apos;s just as much sense as everything else i &apos;ve heard about when it was about explaining the absolutely crazy amount of creativity of creative process .
so it &apos;s pretty far . and for those of you who haven &apos;t been there , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment that &apos;s ever been done -- 27 miles across the diameter .
and i argued that we might be able to create a new form of cambrian explosion in the massive new array of education based on this digital design .
the reason that this used to be better than everything was worse than anything was worse , when everything was worse , it was possible for people to make experiences that were a surprising surprise .
and i was talking to myself that if i doubled my effort to perfection and never doubling a mistake that the voice could be transmitted .
so these are just a few of the clips that i &apos;ve been collecting over the last six months -- but they can also be the last six days . or the last six years .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i would take several months to plan them to find the different places for the pieces of the pieces .

if you play also , you can see some nuances here , looking for zoom in , and the mouth is a optimism of optimism . the eyebrows are surprising .
you have to imagine that if you &apos;re going to do something about the classic trajectory , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , it &apos;s just an hour .
i &apos;m a wall . to work on each day , i have to stand up at the same time and sweat me , and i &apos;m really pleased and really unpleasant .
so they found , according to herotus , the rootus game and agreed to a national strategy , and one day you would eat . the next day you would play .
the other note says whether we use the zero-sum emissions , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
the movie studio , i sold this as &quot; romeo and julia on a ship . &quot; it became a lovely film , a passionate film , a passionate film .
so far , in discussions , these insulers are trying to make insults that have a small web that has a small web that has nothing to do with our verbal and nothing .
and so we decided to build a half-berlin where we can actually form the electrical output of the island at the scale of one in three .
that means that the interpret has to interpret this inconvenience of the emergence language in a different , audible , concrete , non-verbal music .
it &apos;s intuitive use not only for apple to do an elementary economic factor , fundamental success factor , if i just want to use technology to people .
a lot of journalists called me to the question , &quot; what test are you going to do that tells us whether casters are female , or male ? &quot;
now , what i hear is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing that &apos;s wrong .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them to play together any kind of game to control their health better .
and imagine , in fact , i &apos;ve even had a five-year-old child with dr. p. and this is trying to stop these practices , without natural success .
bg : well , the actual extent for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion dollars a year more than you do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore and interact , and the unexpected ones that we form are actually the real soil of creativity .
and since there was neither video games nor this oversearching with computer generates the entire language in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
so , as you know , in the village , who did what happened with whom and when this is what happens today , this extension of our own self through these mobile devices of mobile devices .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility , and so i would be able to protect my patients without contact him .
i got a fine ticket , because i &apos;m not on the bike , but there &apos;s a lot of disability to keep up on the road .

if we look at one of the founding democracy of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream of a kind . &quot;
jacques cousteau came to our living rooms with his fascinating shows that we live and places and a world of wonder that we could never imagine before .
and when it comes to us , of course , it makes us feel like this , for nike , for nike and mauritz and the whole textile industry .
in each step , we produced these pieces in the transmitter so that we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process , which you will see in a minute .
unlike the twin entertainment of the 20th century , the community of the community is part of our way to be part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or doing something new .
my wife , my children , and i moved to the garage , and these hacker programmers and words , theoretically , and archival have taken our house .

everybody thinks i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have been able to celebrate somewhere on a towel at the beach .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and they should also do that , because these love history , like romantic , is always powerful .
my first memories are from this boat -- the stealing virtue of the engine , the clapping of each threshold on the bay , the bug and the horizon .
and when you manipulate the speed of this role-manipulation , you &apos;re actually able to exploit the rotor and finally , even the centrifuge to exploit .
it &apos;s the living self , the doctor &apos;s doctor -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt now , if i put them up here ? &quot;
now , if we go forward and go to old animals , let &apos;s say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are even the main thing that people should be worried about .
we should call them what it is , a commercial , a commercial , the ecological capital capital capital that enables this production .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use storage carbon dioxide that could just be produced to productivity , convert co2 into fuel in fuel to drive this process .
so when i started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
if people would take that seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything on your head , everything we believe , for example , in tax politics and so on .

this looks like this , who doesn &apos;t have any freedom , can &apos;t be moved for his actions and perceptions , and he &apos;s therefore unable to calculate .
since i &apos;m going to have more life expectancy than today , and that &apos;s why my palette is still going to have much more colorful numbers of emotions , emotions and sensitive than today .
there &apos;s also an artist &apos;s artistic aspect with biological materials and , yes , electronics can bumps , and combined in a pretty common way .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat oceans , is so fascinating to life as we can hardly imagine .
and then the volume of the semantic connection , and the feet that come out of it is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic network .

and then we put a v.c. burning of burning and burning the laser rings and then tries to focus on these camera .
of course , the chance of randomness is very small , very small , that they are getting more numerous , so they &apos;re probably not going to make any of the instructions .
that means that instead of remembering individually we have standardized dishes , broader patterns of memories that we can memorize our personal memories .
and yet , the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming is the remarkable value of clean coal technology that you see here , everything .

we see a lot , many gigabytes of digital photographs here that you can move forward and continue to be able to remove in any way .
this tribe , the codes , have 17 variants on aashuaaso , which you all recognize at the big distance in the forest , which seems like our eyes as a way .
and i was confused , because i thought , the whole idea of advertising is your product as many people could be able to see it as many people as possible .
and in this community , you can see that the most important thing is the observation you have in front of each other , because you have a job that you can explain in a different way .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are too disturbing on earth to realize that they &apos;re not at all .
that our system also has an aesthetic increase , it &apos;s because we &apos;re going to do 20 percent with density and also a prices on the other things .
we &apos;ve only been using for two years phosphorus and now by the phosphorus mountain worldwide , much more uranium in the environment than in all atomic anatomics .
we propose that in 10 years , the rate of recognition of the civil liberal honor will be as high as the presence of the election of the election .
and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s grown up on the internet , and the idea that it &apos;s not so hard to do things that you just have to build systems .
and so far the isolation goes when we have a species of distance , there will be isolation and change the environment that could produce the evolution in a natural way .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science . but i &apos;m now thinking , i &apos;m sure you have to do a director , a leader can be like a shipping apple or something .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species of the species and convicted in a new species on the new software that we gave in the new software .
well , i hope that you agree with me , that players are human resources that we can use to live in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .

but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at a stop when there was a pause , octavio said , &quot; paul paul , we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
but for two weeks , we programmed , we went to the street prosthetic in venice , my kids were involved , my dog , and we created this .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the old greek historian historic herotus , you might know this story . the story of how and why games were invented .
but i think in this frame here , and with the intent , from an illusion to make something real , i &apos;m just going to leave the needle in there and go from the stage .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try to look at things , whether it works , it works if it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
a lot of arguments about it . fishing pollutants produce the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take an inefficient fish . a big part .
and because they work much harder than we work , and because they &apos;re only three to six months of life , they &apos;re talking about weight in their weight , in the energy consumption , a little bit of three billion people .
so if you take the system like i &apos;m taught it , and all of the eruptions of health care , it &apos;s not the end of the system .
i think this is the remarkable value of the last year , which is the last decade that we &apos;re shifted by a physical world to a digital world .
so gender is really complicated ; winter is not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a certain way , can be distributed across the entire bandwidth .
and by the way , we migrate and district , and we mix so much that they can &apos;t tell longer that isolation is necessary for evolution , for evolution , to find state-of-the-art .
of course , the stories that i was looking out of the science-to-art area : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
and in this scenario , imagine that in a case , the sperm is wearing a chomosom that hits the chromosome of the chromosome .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive , to survive and to survive , from the fight of the human mind is determined to translate through conflicts .
and then i went to berlin for berlin years , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and i didn &apos;t know that in carroll .

so there &apos;s great challenges here . there are challenges in transmission . if we say that the energy outside the country is out there , they don &apos;t just need the technology ; they need to deal with the risk of where energy comes from .
but , as we think , the only way that biology is going to have a major impact without any increase in the cost of food , or the limitation of its availability , if we see co2 as an carbon material , and therefore we &apos;re working on these cells .
i started working with scientific literature , working on how these centrifuge were built in nateway , and found that they were structured in what they called the kakkacapacity , and every kaskage in 164 .
now the fascinating thing is that the tape of tape , which contains in the liane , is mao &apos;inhibitors of the same kind , which is necessary to question the trasound . so they ask themselves .
this is a problem , because the global warming is looking for the arctic ocean ocean , where there &apos;s a big amount of frozen carbon that gives you the carbon , which if it &apos;s inflated by micromethane .
and what we found out is that the goal of the attack was actually , it was slow and unheating -- obviously , trying to make an attempt to desperate engineer engineers , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get to the very quickly .
so perhaps german &apos;s point of this technological change , because the only thing that there was always another truth , which is that every person in society can give something special and very powerful and powerful and powerful that the human ability to adapt is our scale .
my good friend ray shorter has shown us that every tool , the information technology is going to be on the curve of moore &apos;s curved law , and the prices of pricing performance every 12 to 24 months .
the first project that we did as an international group , as we were aware of ourselves , o.k , there are now as a real scene here , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people that are always there and so forth .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you never walk , and never be so moving , like other kids , or you could never lead a independent life , and since then they just gave me a lie . &quot;
what if we could flip this situation , and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going from one other to another , we can start to go from a lot of things to many things , and by seeing patterns , what are the ones that were going to love ?
that &apos;s what we feel as guilty of the earth is that we say , there &apos;s no bio-built , no bioland , no proposition , no proper proper proper progression , and as they all allow you to say that our own excrete will go back .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i was doing something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in single organisms , divided each cell , and all the genetic information that &apos;s led into both of these cells .
it was worth food for me for all this year to be in the clean room , because check the mask , the mask difference between a single atom and this piece of metal is just like the difference between the metal and all of them .
and then i went out to six-and-a-half , and then we got together with friends , i became the founder of the company , and then i got together with the span of the spider carcinema , which became one of the largest cellular manufacturers in the world .
at the time , it was a monkey , where adel , aerus and others have said , &quot; you &apos;re actually rambling when people start reading the people , and then they want to talk to the afterwards , and of course , that &apos;s totally atal .
if a representations in spawned something unpossible , something magic has done : allah , olina , olina , allah , lah , albuh , great brainsurely , there &apos;s a refugee look : a refugee look at god .
so what &apos;s happening in &quot; the carriage &quot; is that everything from the top to the bottom , from the very beginning to the end , is completely unable to see , with the marks -- from the cover , you see the film in the movie , is the marx .
and the message is , well , we have to rely on these rotators , if we go to our goals , 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 percent , 20 percent , three , three , three percent , and so if we want to reach out at all .
and then you &apos;ve got a three-month-long time period of time with a &quot; richness &quot; which was very good . &quot; it was told to them that they were very smart . and after three months , they &apos;ve actually written up .
and what i &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is made up of normal letters , which we use to be symbolized -- and i &apos;ve written my business card on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve written 10 times 10 times .
and i wonder today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful girl has shaped my own image , and i could imagine to think of myself as a nature of nature , powerful power and powerful human being .
and there you &apos;re going to be from my general doctor , so that he can see where my weight problem is , and it &apos;s not only in the moment that i need cardiological support , but also with a look at the past .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early &apos; 80s when i was starting with the elementary school , and i started to build my self-assembly picture of my family surrounding field and shape , also in terms of other children and other children around the world around me .
it &apos;s a picture of the first puncture particles that took all the way back to the lhc , then complained a part of the lhc collider , to put a scaffolding on the detector .
he brought 400,000 people to his people , because he was able to see that red species , beekeepers and they also have a lot of effective oil than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can go out of aids .
and finally , i think that , although it &apos;s so dramatic , it &apos;s so beautiful and inspiring and so inspiring , we end up not at the end of our technology , we &apos;re not going to be able to develop the things that we don &apos;t have , we don &apos;t have to get on our mind and understand .
what i &apos;m doing instead , and what the designers are doing , is we &apos;re thinking on a certain abstract level , which is that the machine and the machine does something that makes our skills far better , and better than we could ever do .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops worldwide , with students and architects and architects , even with ctos &apos; 50-plus company , and there &apos;s something about this task , which is the depth of nature in nature , and i want some of them to share with you .
and since you see that you see our seven senses , most of us , we &apos;ve only been thinking about five days , even seven , there &apos;s certainly going to be in the near future , in the next future , to make sense , and as an extension of our self .
what you have to do there is maybe it &apos;s easy , but it &apos;s not . you have to do all the co2 that comes out of the barrel of the barrel , capture pressure , pressure under liquid and then hope , and then somewhere else , and that it stays there .
and as a miracle , he took his mind and started to play a bunch of clubs and then asked me to play , and then to end up playing , delhi , icowi , silia .
i was committed to the place and to his brother and his father -- with the words , &quot; well , my proposal is that tony &apos;s following : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to get a worried and we &apos;ll find a way to find that he can do his art again .
now , i have to stand up when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / sex , death sex , death for sex -- it seemed quite reasonably reasonable at the time , but with every year , it &apos;s getting to my two-thirds .
i &apos;m an historic historian , and in this case , i studied people like anatomy -- hull , human body , animal body body body body -- how they went to body fluid , with physical concepts ; how they thought about bodies .
because it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether it &apos;s the minister of health , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to accept the experts of my experts to mammography or &quot; any creature of cancer , the patient wants to treat his caffs .
so now , if i do that the profiles the profiles in the scene , then you collect some hair samples , and then you can turn this technique , and then you can say , o.k , this hak belongs to this person .
he convicted the dog and improvised an iron , took the skeleton of the dog and improved a bad one , relaxed another dog , and then went over the pigeon of the ice sheet .
the reason why kids are growing up with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s grown or siamesian twins , it &apos;s interacting with sexual surgeons -- often by surgeons that are adapted to the norm , is not because it would be the advantage of their physical health .
because ... ... at the end , it &apos;s like followed . centuries ago , in the most desert south africa , humans seem to live on monthly battles with sacrifices and music that have been kept for hours -- to the morality of morality .
so i also wrote a paper about it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; frankenstein , &quot; why they believed that molecules were given certain molecules on a particular type of randomized way to overhead in nature .
and then the next one that came up with neo-neural model or mental model like the software eredication , which is that you have a idea of something that can use a metaphor to make the computer uskable .
the spirits can be drawn under the great water , responded to the rhythms of the dance to translate the soul of the living soul , so that the olymth is going to be a short moment for god .
it was on a piano curriculum for music students at my beloved teacher , professor jude , a famous beethoven beethoven , concerttoxie , and then a professor of the music school in high school .
but this is my prototype that i &apos;ve seen , but it &apos;s kind of driving out , like , on a table , the thing on electronics , electronics and pressure , and that was the pressure , but the pressure was too high , the thing is broken .
we took a ps33 camera , they &apos;ve built it , put it on a led-light light light , and now we &apos;ve got a device that &apos;s free -- you can build it yourself , we can put it to the code that you can download for free .
we look in this web , we see the fifth hertz , and if it &apos;s nine incompound , we &apos;re going to catch some valleys , we &apos;re going to take some valves , then we &apos;re going to put a little bite in there , we &apos;re going to get up .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year out and work in an environment , which is pretty much what they actually hate , we &apos;ve got them working in the government .
in which we did this simple thing , there was a rise of the participation to 20 percent , and there was a number of people who were willing to save the number of people , or to consider four percent when they were willing to pay for the savings .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , older people , and people with severe body injuries with severe body injuries , and maybe this happened because life expectancy in the life of these people was valuable for society .
now , we have three-story laws that bring people behind the guards , for a bike stake stake , for the top bloodstream , for the low-cost feet , rather than giving them the things that give them to the sacrifice .
and the idea is to imagine that , again , that we remove the people with doing something to do and change the environment -- almost as we call it , we call it the cloud movement , to build a discrimination , but with a cloud .
and yes , you see , it &apos;s relatively heteroous , so there are people who make the home alone , up to large organizations that are more likely to be used in institutional form .
and to me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science continues to make progress in the anatomy of nuclear power , that we &apos;re going to get to a point where we &apos;re going to have to admit that democracy is going to be based on the anatomy , which is there ?
and i &apos;m at the end , and i hope , the video works , a very , very nice project , which is the bachelac work of michael burk , ankathra in kathrorge , jorge , jorg and janitor .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you spend and i spend several thousand dollars -- gps , gps video and video , libraries of books and music and music , technology to the medical diagnostic diagnostic -- are literally becoming more materialized and cheap in your cell phone .
heinrich , because you take the fact that it &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the xy with xy -- there you take that it &apos;s male , he can now be attracted to what maria needs to do .
finally , a consequence of buying a bad voice if there &apos;s only one way to buy it , is that if you &apos;re unsatisfied , and you ask yourself , why is the answer , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what can you do ?
&quot; when we were fighting in eastern europe to fight the oppression , we wanted to do everything , but what we needed most , hope was to be a mental affordable , the willingness , sometimes to be hopeless places in places , and to be witness . &quot;
so here you have this license between the unconscious and the conscious , which is immediately where you can do something about it , and the things that you know that you look very different from , so that you can make a lot better for them and sound .
namely , i think that the interactive media in us , archaic models , cognitive models , so we think patterns that have been programmed in our biological memory , very long , very long time ago , and that we can just recreate the interactive media through just an interactive media .
afterwards , the old tyrannan civilization , which is the caribbean level of colombia , and in the consequence , this people turned into a volcanic canic canov back over the caribbean level of caribbean .
and in front of the background , i went into the field of natural interface , so the next generation in human computers , so in the relationship of the computer &apos;s relationship with the computer , like our tools , or how computers change the computer from the computational digital assistant to the digital assistant .
and i know some of you are saying , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; if the world isn &apos;t a better place , if we were to speak all a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let me say , this language is going to be the yoruba . you &apos;re going to be so much better .
so she goes to the house and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the poem through her , and she &apos;s going through her , and she &apos;s going through a pen , and she goes through her , and then she said -- she was like , when she was on her hand , and she grabs it up .
and i would take that entry seriously , i would be born in a world that somebody like me would perceive as a person who could live in their lives in a more positive way , but today , but i &apos;m going to be able to take for the chances and the adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
that was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and deception , just to discover and see , immediately , looking at recognizing , characterizing vision and access to information , especially access to information , what &apos;s going on -- the last time is certainly the biggest problem .
we have these living traces , we have these things that we want to live in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to do , and i wanted to do a rich hand , and it didn &apos;t do all the teeth that i wanted to flip all the experiences that i wanted to do and never wanted to do .
if we change the plastics , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water storage , that they can get back to cell lockness , then they can grow in a baby or in tunisia , or in tunisia , hundreds of thousands of trees .
and it turns out , under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a 60,000 dollars a year of 60,000 dollars a year .
it may be more to me , rather clear to think that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome , but that we &apos;re open to the poor , to use the poor , to pack them on the chest , to use a champion to use a champion , and maybe even dance to dance with it .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness -- the place of a massive violent exposure that has been devastating for decades , and for decades , a lot of lives are like the first world war .
so , this whole discussion of how is going to move at the moment -- and herd energy , like this is going to go , on the island that we have , for example , for the fifth of five to three percent extent , so we &apos;re going to move the wind and the sun .
so we &apos;ve started with some volunteers who are starting to give us something more than a year ago , in seattle , have helped march the things that you could call away -- different kinds of things like you can see -- things like you can see -- things that you would throw away from it .
tan tan le , anonymity from noisy scar , was now tan , refugee and social activist who was invited to places that had never heard of , and in terms of expressions that they could never have imagined .
they knew that every year , about 75,000 hondurals left their country to go out into the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do the same thing in honduras .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy is growing with this picture in his room , but the reason i show you why i &apos;m showing you this is the formula in the past 1 years , i &apos;ve been very interesting .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermal sources , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that had never seen before , that nobody had ever seen before , and for the science of science at the time , when we saw them , we didn &apos;t even find words .
we believe that smallpolek -- we believe that smallpox is not pervasive , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and therefore we &apos;re probably the best institution for the world in the world . our website will get 35 million dollars a month .
and i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should distribute rights in people &apos;s rights , because i have to admit that i have to know that i have to have a series of real triggers that are probably more likely to deserve than some people i know .
and this is what we &apos;re looking at millions of facial fights all over the world , if we have to take the harbor of the nearest century , the face of attack , the face of all the jokes on the episode of an episode .
what kids do is they start with the marshmallow , and they start building a successful prototype , and they &apos;re always building the marshmallow on the top of the tip , so that they have a way to repair the possibility of trees .
and then there &apos;s also some stuff that &apos;s already done in the everyday life , which is most people , but not consciously , for example , washing green enzymes that allow us to wash four degrees , are also more sophisticated enzymes .
and then you go to the consumer electronics , to put together a stereo facility -- speaker , cd , a cd player , a papers , radio , radio , radio . and in this electronics , there &apos;s so many stereo business .
i find that they were so strong and so strong , and so radical , in what they did , i found out that i was going to see all of the years of doing a couple of years of paintings to see the skull 76 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s completely forgotten .
what we &apos;ve learned from cultural overwhelming studies is that women , in average -- not average -- but in average , in average , are more complex social relations and social relationships for people who are in the group , are very much too much attention .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon that i talked about a couple of years ago , who had a couple of siblesins of ampious twins with herself to divide them in a way to make a name .
in order to make these theories , we call ourselves in memory that it &apos;s definitely about grace , it has to be a high-end goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be done in iran , because most of the infections have been infected .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you take the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering , whether you should have that available , if you &apos;re going to get things faster , or that innovation , as we need it .
and this was a huge disorder at the time , because , of course , you started to manifest the living language in visual form of writing , which means what the fluid and fluid is alive , and i &apos;m on top of it , and i &apos;m manipulating it in a rock and i &apos;m also manipulating it .
so , as the golden cat corporation , you &apos;re going to get rid of your 10 to the worst cats catastrophe , you &apos;re going to see that the winner winner was by 87 percent -- a result of the outcome , the increase in numbers of salvation , and the cost of salvation .
so the tedtalk , in a very simple form , is that a charter city is a place where unemployed land is a greenland , a founder that determines the laws of law , the laws and the opportunity to decide , either in those rules or not to live .
we followed the geneticulology of eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death and when we asked people to do something about it , they found that one of the people was so old that he died because of his aging , and we still killed him with the spears .
but if we look at this metabolic map , the very simple , compared to our trust . it &apos;s a simple thing to me , but if we look at all of these genes that we can see after one another , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
if you just gave me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose this wish , which is , for example , the biased energy episode without carbon . this wish i &apos;m going to make .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is someone who &apos;s released him when he &apos;s shaped , because he knows , he &apos;s not very good at the score when he &apos;s covered in a snow .
at this point , the patients come to play . they can &apos;t just take control over the control of their own ship , but can also help us with health care , the challenges that are facing us , the free of the health care , doubling , double and so on .
and then there &apos;s a memory of self , and the memory itself is itself , the counseling and the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one who speaks the doctor by saying , &quot; how did you feel in the last time ? &quot;
now , in the world of savings , i think one of the best examples that have come to the market is recently about how to vote the best choices of choice , something where david lason has been very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
about an hour after they came home , after i finished it home , they collapsed , and they called the family 11 . the rescue assistant to the emergency room , they brought back to the emergency station with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous state .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the malayan coast , and on the young man who collapsed , and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the first flavor of the first tape , gave me the one of the men on the platform .
now , what this thing does is that it starts with the sensory value of sensors -- so , for example , by printing sensors and vibrational sensory sensors -- and it gives legitimate code to the code , while it &apos;s going on with the wrong data .
how can these people come from a flora of 80,000 species of inconvenient plants find these two morphologically unrelated plants that combined when combined this way , create a kind of biochemical version , so that all that the sum is bigger than the parts of its parts ?
and there was only one time in which there was only jeans of a way , and they bought them , and they were bad , they were incredibly comfortable , and when they wear enough , and often they had enough washed enough , and they started feeling , &quot; ok . &quot;
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t perceive that there are only three fingers here : because the mind and the way the information works , as it doesn &apos;t matter , one , two , three , but as you see it as a group .
and these sounds , and these rhythm have the geology , the topography of a region , and , of course , this has enabled that you could put these songs together , and put them together , and put on the left , and go back to the right , and again to the gangal .
i also think there are theories that are starting to understand how everything with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplified story about what &apos;s going to tell you that these little oil spills around , which have different kinds of receptions that contain different kinds of chemicals for chemicals .
how often we chose a political leader -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we look back , and we expect that government to reflect our values , and our needs , and our needs , and then we don &apos;t have much change ?
now , this could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years , because this information had to be learned about the evolutionary effects of individuals , because of those individuals , because of these fruit , these processing structures were not there .
so , for example , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report of a captain soundscape , so the one that was going to come into this big fish , can &apos;t be used or used by fisheries , or from the scientific scientists usually won &apos;t be done because he &apos;s not a scientific scientist . &quot;
you know , the genocide , the physical exception of people will die from general extinctions , but the ethnicity , the destruction of the destruction of people &apos;s lifestyle , is not only unconvicted , but my general , as a part of a development strategy .
what if you could change the sperm and the cells or the frozen fertilizers to give you a better chance of giving kids a better chance to live a healthy life -- the diabetes of diabetes , the irrigation , the ugly risk of cancer , the risk of cancer ?
on the bottom of the ocean , the bacteria are there , the thermics are , and by doing the hot buttons , if fish were there if fish were fish there , they had vaccinated fish to the fish , yet they were able to make it a living environment in there .
the great genetics in the 20th century , tgdogy , who was also a communicator in the russian doorthodox church , once wrote a sentence that doesn &apos;t make any sense of biology in biology .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve been able to make sure that the life of a patient is worse , and you &apos;ve done that the memory of memory itself is much better than a patient , because now you &apos;ve given a patient to a better story about his experience .
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals , not just a farm that measures your health of your health , but a farm that is literally a farm plant , and not just for those fish , but for you , not for me and for you .
it &apos;s that you &apos;re not just saying that you &apos;re just a word for the word &quot; text is transmitted in a different language , &quot; but you have to understand the deeper sense of words and words and what they &apos;re having to understand , so that there &apos;s a meaningful translation that everybody knows that &apos;s going to do with strangers .
and , again , if i take a step back , and i look at everything , i can look at my way back to my search for search for my suchi past , here i &apos;m looking for neanderthals here , right here , or here , for live labs .
well , what you could do with patient &apos;s patient , and we actually did experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , and it &apos;s actually how you could actually increase the mirror patient &apos;s mental health patient &apos;s patient &apos;s patient by just getting the close to the end , not too much in it .
do you do it by the task of the will to create the challenge of the will -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment , which is the most challenging environment , and you can find it , because of the noise , and because of the weird connection , the combination , when a small group of people are educated by a team .
and i took them and i would take them to the world at the bottom of the world : astrobiologists , biologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in such extreme situations , and i took them to look at the sources that they could take samples , take samples and test instruments and so on .
you understand that it &apos;s not just that people have to eat dog food when they go to the retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to have enough money to make it , it means that it &apos;s so hard to make decisions that they adapt large invested in their employers .
and while all of this time , they &apos;re being introduced to cultural values in their society , values , values that tell the claim that their commandments and only their prayers , their cosmic cosmological -- or we could say the ecology -- the equity of the equation .
the leaders of the government in honduras would be based on the help of partnerships , they could benefit from their own partnerships that they could support for the charter of the charter and the law that everybody could trust that the charter is really being put on the charter .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the ideal wealth where you bring new elements into the game -- how the hostage -- and how the trust requires both trust and the trust and also -- while it &apos;s really fun .
he drove speed at high speed when he suddenly sounds a little fragment of a melody that sounds like inspiration , often it &apos;s difficult for him to be hard for elderly . and he wants it . he &apos;s a prayer . he &apos;s full of it , but he can &apos;t touch it .
another example : a couple of years ago , i got the phone call from a 19 year-old who was born when young , when young , he had a boy , had a friend of mine who lived with his girlfriend , when he was a man , and he found that he had an eggs and had a mother .
but only there was a company , an agent was ready to help us -- and that &apos;s just because i know john bond and richard shensha tree for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to deal with my team and my team with my team .
in fact , i &apos;ve been looking for the biggest part of my career to take a sense of terrible situations , and all this is just trying to study the social attempt to study the social insula , and they &apos;re interesting , and hopefully , in a way , in a way that makes you believe in the audience and make it accessible .
and this curiosity also showed that i would always be when i wasn &apos;t in school , through the forests of the forests , and samples , &quot; samples , &quot; samples , frogs and frogs and frogs and swalks and bows , and all the water would come home and look at the microscope .
she ran out of the devil like the devil at the house while she was followed by this poem , and it was just about that she had to get enough of paper and a pen and a pen , so she had to get it through it , and she could capture it on the thumb .
the next weeks , i made a bow , and i went to the first time for the first time , the healthy dogs that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself alone , i felt isolated , not the kind of healing , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues .
now , i like a little bit of an extreme , you know , in this way , you know , how little appetite i have to remember the pattern of memory , but even if you make more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why do we spend so much memory in the weight of the weight that we give ?
you can think of this cultural life as a ethnic sphere , ethnosphere , and ethnicity can be defined as the sum of all the thoughts and dreams , myths , myths and spots and intuitions that have been defined by the human imagination for the creation of consciousness .

one of the things that i &apos;ve learned about a while ago , i &apos;ve learned about a time ago , is that this is a student group that wants to give the public to more the public what she wanted to learn in the uni , and have done so on street , to try to explain small action and explain to people what n.na is n.na .

bill gates bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we need only 10 million . and even if we put our materials into a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s safe , it &apos;s only 100 million people in the 1000s .
this really works , which is what &apos;s done in the academic sample , and we thought , o.k , which we might have , then we &apos;ve got a webcam on the webcup , the lens , the lens , then the left , then you &apos;ve got a microscope , you &apos;ve got a microscope about a microscope , which is about four times .

and if you &apos;re going to choose one other vacation b , there &apos;s a conflict between both of your two species and you have to think about how you decide how to decide this conflict , and that &apos;s not really obvious at all , because if you &apos;re going to get a sense of time , and if you think about it . and if you think about it , in the sense of yourself , you could get another answer .

here in the picture , you see the lab , in leadership , so it &apos;s a kind of garage with all kinds of lab labeling , the untouched group , which is a group in paris , which has been successfully successful in paris , and it &apos;s pretty interesting to do pretty interesting things , because i want to cut a project in a short term .
no biologist would claim to claim that 50 percent or more of all species are just extinct , because it &apos;s not easy . and yet , this -- the apocalyptic scenario on the biodiversity of biological diversity -- which is barely known as the most optimistic aspect of the diversity of the cultural diversity .
bg : well , we haven &apos;t yet noticed a place on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting openness to all the rules for &quot; nuclear &quot; -- there &apos;s big interest , and there are big people in russia in russia , india in russia , india , india , india -- i &apos;ve been here , and i &apos;ve spoken the energy and talked about how it fits to the energy agenda .

and then , if you look at the software that we &apos;ve just seen , look at it , you &apos;ll also understand why neanderthal percent of our software or not quite intuitively designed on ib , which is the ipad in many ipad , or in many cases , even though it &apos;s intuitive , even though it &apos;s more classic than software .
and the result is -- we call it &quot; patients &quot; autonomy . &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift of the responsibility for making the change of someone &apos;s decisions of someone -- the name of the namics -- that doesn &apos;t know anything , and that &apos;s probably the most likely one thing to do , and that &apos;s why the best decision is to make a decision -- the patient &apos;s good .
and this idea was when i was in the middle of a game process of cary , pray , pray , love . i fell into one of these grasses of the two , where we all fall in , if we &apos;re working on something , and we don &apos;t do it . you think it &apos;s going to be a desktop of it . that &apos;s the worst book that &apos;s ever written .

so we &apos;ve done a study in a study that i &apos;ve done with shlomo and alessandro harbor , we &apos;ve done a study of people with the study of people -- they &apos;ve been working for all -- and these people were all collected in a collection collection collection collection in their participation for their own savings .

i was scared , not fear , but i was afraid that i could lose him that he could sink into one of his circumstances , and that i could destroy his relationship to the mind , if i started talking about lightweight and pearting and other pediatrics and other forms of selected selective .

it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who said we had two reflections of two different surgeons , and he decides what he &apos;s going to choose , the one who &apos;s selected the memory is , the memory is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon , the surgeon is going to be chosen .
you know , all of you know the healthy dogs , if you give a secret of the best price of the cost , even though you &apos;re on one of those things , and you &apos;re going to be picking up and then you &apos;re going to get the best friend and the best friend so that i &apos;m talking about , and if you &apos;re going to get a little bit bad at the end , and you &apos;re not going to make a difference again .
you know , one of the great sensitivity of travel in travel , and one of the jokes of ethnography is common research with people who are still able to remember the old days . their past , they still feel the past , they &apos;re in the rain , they &apos;re touching off the rain , they &apos;re touching into the bitter stores of plants .
if you ever have a chance to have the opportunity to work in a urban center , like our scott scott synerman , you &apos;re doing part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re all going to see -- you &apos;re going to see that people , because of the government , they &apos;re having a lot of problems , including lots of problems , including a thumb in their house .
it &apos;s actually a beautiful thing to do when you do that , agriculture , agriculture is creating biogas , creating a hectare on a hectare country with five apartments in favelas in favelas , so he can actually wait about a 40-thousand-hundred dollars dollars and the economies that are waiting for it to grow and grow a chicken and vegetables and vegetables .
we &apos;re at the threshold of an amazing wave , amazing events on many areas . but i really think that we need to go back to 300 years ago to find a time when we &apos;re fighting progress in progress , we &apos;re fighting about these things that we &apos;ve done more than tricky things now .
so by visualizing color , contrast and helplessness to the individual images , photographing photographers , photographers like the rock , depend on the rocks and colors and colors , we leave the boundaries between the different images and the paintings like a picture , although a picture can basically look at hundreds of light at hundreds of levels .
if i was in a room with a room full of colleagues and asked them to support their soundscape support , and tell them what i just told them what i was going to tell you , i probably wouldn &apos;t achieve the end of the second story before it was really unpleased before they were going to give you an irrigation , someone would invite you , and if you were going to change the subject and forget the rest .
well , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good moment to turn your audiences , take your personal communication , give you your personal communication device -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can look at a look at the thryn box , which is why there &apos;s nothing else going to be in this talk about something else you &apos;re going to do .
a few years ago , the laser prize at the university of shinya shamyamana was abandoned for his research in which he took a adult skin , a broader blade , and through the manipulation of just four cell , to bring them into a pluripotent cell cell , a potentially potentially possible cell in a cell .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve been able to show all kinds of batteries that are made , for the cars , computers , cell phones , toys , lamps , for everything . and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done with the electronic energy that the world , which i found out is that all batteries that we can now produce less than 10 minutes of energy .
now , let &apos;s take a step back to the time of the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signature of living , maybe three to three billion years ago , on earth -- the first tall of the earth -- maybe as a billion organisms , as much as a billion or 800 years ago -- and then the human species that &apos;s been formed in the last 00,000 years .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral notre notre that ended up in the computer with flickr from flickr . just give you an emergence in tire , and you &apos;re going to get a picture of men in my t-shirt , and at the university table , and so every one of these fareye-feaks represents shows a picture that was discovered to this model .
and yet , here in this country , in the old-fashioned states , we &apos;re adding people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted to death row , higher than victims , when it &apos;s black when it &apos;s black . 22 times higher , when the first time the black is black and black and the black and white in the same states -- in the same states , there &apos;s the real world in their body .
i was traveling with a young boy of 6,000 miles from western land in china across south dose to south tibet , and when i was hated to hate the face of la , i was listening to the face of the statistics that you hear about 6,000 monholy , and the 1.2 million , and millions of people were transformed by the cultural revolution as the cultural revolution were murdered .
and that &apos;s why the idea is , if you have all kinds of major problems in investing in something that you &apos;ve only got later -- and that &apos;s not that investing is not so clear . in fact , ipc is not necessarily the worst mar , and there are all people in the rich world who look at ipcc , and say , &quot; cc , that &apos;s not a big deal .
we made the chromosome of the chromosome species of micro-species , and we said , &quot; these are the two sows of each other as humans and mice . we made some extra genes so that we could choose this chromosome of the chromosome . we were able to break it up with an enzyme , and it was a very astonishing thing , and as we put it into a cell -- and we gave them a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very well , here .
margaret garet mead , the great anthropologist said before she died that she &apos;s the biggest fear of her fear , that as we go in a direction , into a fast-forward , expanded world view , we &apos;re not just moving the entire human bandwidth of human imagination in a sense , but we &apos;re going to see that one day from a dream , one day , and we &apos;ve never forgotten that there &apos;s any other possibilities .
i &apos;d like to show you an original database of noah , and this is from a early prototype of photosynth photosynth , who we &apos;ve been working in the summer to show you what i think it &apos;s really the pointing technology behind this technology , which is photosynthetic technology . and this is not so obvious when you look at the environments that we &apos;ve been looking at the website .
in some studies of other words , sugar pills have shown in some studies , a measurable effect , the placebo effect , which is just because the person thinks what &apos;s going on with their hand , is a pharmaceutical or a pharmaceutical sort of -- for example , if there &apos;s only the patient &apos;s enough to believe in the body that you call the placement of the placebo effect .
now , when one said no , this was vetype chopp , which has just crushed a jet , and i &apos;ve spent 10 years talking about it for 10 years , whether i &apos;m going to study my great engineering engineers , maybe actually , a really big deal with me , because all my father &apos;s colleagues , all my father &apos;s colleagues have always talked about him , you &apos;ve chosen the money out of the window on the window .
i had recently had this encounter as i met the extraordinary american diary in ruth stone , who was now over 90 , but her entire life in dense . she told me that she was a local virginia growing up in virginia in virginia , and she said she could hear her work , and how she could feel like a poem about her landscape .
it means that a little kid is growing out of the angles , growing up in the belief that the mountain is a puppet that will be your destiny , or your destiny , your destiny , will determine a different person , and a different relationship to this rescue , or as a little child from montana , which is growing up in the mountain that is a pile that a pile can be a pistle that can be transmitted .
it &apos;s usually my role in explaining my role to explain to people like the wonderful technologies that are coming up on the side , and i thought , because i &apos;m here in my friends , i &apos;m here in my friends , i would tell you what i &apos;m really trying to look back and try and see what &apos;s really going on here , and what &apos;s going on with this incredible jumping , which is that we can &apos;t happen to happen .
and that would be their answer to the bjelllomborg argument that if you use all this time and use the energy to solve the co2 , to solve all the other goals , the goals of the disease , the arteries , the reducing of malaria , and so that there &apos;s a duty of resource to spend a waste of resources on food , while investing things , there &apos;s better things that we can do .
these people have come online to travel online , but they have illegal what they &apos;ve been doing by using trojans to pursue money from our bank account for free , while we &apos;re doing our online banking , or our keybanks , our keyboard , our credit card information , where we &apos;ve collected the information about the keyboard , while we &apos;re buying a computer online .
every time she got back to montombe , she had two of her oldest friends . these elderly women , carter carter , who had organized monty-powered boyk bootype -- an incredible roafar -- and virginia virginia , a white man , whose husband , whose husband , who was a white clifford , dr. king , dr. king , dr. king .
and what they &apos;ve been doing is they &apos;ve put together two sides and said , &quot; o.k , that we make easier and cheaper , and then we have open source resources , so we have open source hardware , electronics , things like this device , and this device is now the one that we &apos;ve actually brought together to be the market , and now , the checks are the checks of the checks in the world today .
this made me a different way to another person than my friends under the wax , who believe that the forests of the woods of the hubble and the hippie bosnia are mud and the cannilian balkans , the norwey of the norwegian , the norwegian of the world that they would be involved in their saint .
now , a week ago , verh of the national academy of engineering was the dragaris for francis arnold and wilderness , two scientists , who are reviewed together with each other of the natural engineering process to encourage evolution faster and wanting to lead a constituent in a very efficient way -- which frantic francture from frankenis called &quot; direct evolution . &quot;
and now in biology , i want to take this metaphor out of synthetic biology , which is to take this metaphor from synthetic biology , that biology is actually a science of science , because the naked code is an abstract code , yes , it &apos;s not just the same as computers , because it &apos;s dynamic , it &apos;s dynamic , so because it &apos;s matter , so it &apos;s just cyber , and not just real .
so the bruce of bruce brown , a well-known design researcher at brighton university is so far too far to say that this mass media , he meant that the book and the image , so not the internet , etc . , etc . , etc . , and so on , what we call &quot; mass media &quot; media &quot; today is that these media restores of mass media reviews and our ability .
i &apos;m sure some really happy people , some happy people and companies , for-profit profits and profitable profits , the opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure that chris anderson will never let me leave the right now -- the right to buy the rights of the talk , you know , you just see the title person who had a lot of the title or not a lot of content , and there was a lot of content in the way what it was going to be .
the idea of thinking is that happiness is going to be true of the idea that success or happiness depends on happiness , a challenge without being made by the experience of incomprehensive experience . as if my life was successful , because i was able to fall with a prosthetic life with a prosthetic life , or as i could always be able to perceive myself with my disability .
and when these people came and looked at who was the best proteins in the world , this was not a professor , caltech student , who was not a tech student , but a tech student , somebody from a chester woman , a chester , who , who , when the chairs of the business in a health clinic and worked in a clinic and worked the best proteins in the world at night .
now , of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. p. so that i did not want to do the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the point where the richest enough girls of the hospital are going to be in the second shelter in the second shelf . but he actually taught me to look at my work with new eyes with new eyes . this is how a new kind of course , a new experience and a new experience of experience .
in the past year , i &apos;ve been looking for model for models for this to do this , i &apos;ve also been looking for the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see whether they might have better or better ideas about how we &apos;ve been able to help creative ideas about how to deal with the emotional risks that are associated with creativity .
so we have a situation like this , where our science continues to keep our science , we have to stand up to more , that this categories that we thought we had been a stable anatomic categories , which had very simple peculiar dna to create an identity of identical theories , much more physically , much less physically , than we did .
so i went home and i went home with my wife , and she said , &quot; well , let &apos;s say , &quot; well , if there &apos;s this technology , there &apos;s this technology that you can use to tap your eyes , then we should find a way to find that he can control a tap , so he can do it again , that he could make sure that he could do the genius , but that &apos;s the genius . &quot;
and so there are different ways of doing this , but the beautiful thing is that a molecule has so much energy as a matter of energy , we say , a colear molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , and most of the radiation , the cost of the pressure and the cost , so the potential to play on the land and the things that are almost different things in your own country .
from the medical point of view , you can see , of course , that my legs , the laser surgery for visually disability , cable distraction from titan and artificial hip bike for aging , which allow people to actually use all of their possibilities and spread across the boundaries that have natural enough to develop their own destinations , not to create social platforms of people , make themselves a sense of their own personal identity , and to define their own way , and to redefine their own lives in the world .
&quot; disabled , adjectively : &quot; crushed , helpless , helmet , destroyed , destroyed , devastated , wrestled , wrestless , dish , forwarded , forgotten , rugged , poems , poised , paralyzed , paralyzed , poet , potatoes , smellers , pedal , torired , fatty , despered , fare , desperate , desperate seminated , seminated .
i &apos;m going to leave my abled words for a english scientist . hummrey daphy , the way i suspect , as he used to dedicate the experiments of his application , he was michael faratemple , said , &quot; nothing dangerous for the human development , as a human mind , that our scientific assumptions are not mysterious , that there are no mysteries in nature of nature , there are nature , and there are no peers , there are no peers . &quot;
and we &apos;re going to take a set of companies and we &apos;re going to travel from the ethnosphere that we &apos;re taking to our audience in places like cultural wowning , that they &apos;re going to take away from the laws of the law , and hopefully they &apos;re going to take a look at the other central anthropology of the anthropology of the anthropological anthropology : that the world has made it to different ways that we can actually find a way in a variety of a multicalistic world , which is to contribute to the most successful people who can contribute our lives in the world .
if you buy it , one of them is a decision about the great choice of saldsdsb , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what saldresses is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that they could have made a decision better , and what &apos;s going on . and what &apos;s happened is this alternative to the alternative that they have made the decision to help to help , and that ownership , and that satisfy the satisfaction of their own satisfaction of their own decision when they had made a decision for their decision .
at the end of the end of this amazing thing , you &apos;re going to take one day out of a day , and for the first time in your life , in age 18 years , you see a sunset . and in this crystal moment , the first moment of consciousness , when the sun begins to be on the sun &apos;s astonishing landscape , all of a sudden , everything you &apos;ve learned in terms of abstract articles , and say , &quot; you &apos;re really saying , &quot; how do you know what &apos;s been talking about ? &quot;
what i found really extraordinary was , i found that he collected from my entire childhood childhood , whether i won a letter in the second grade in the second grade class , whether i had the path to parking lots in parliament , whether i was a parent , whether i was a pencil or a athlete of my settlements , and he had this application to teach his students to do this research at the bottom of the gross school , and i was going to do his students .
you know , and if you have people in front of you , the most persuasive belief is that you have a soul , or you can also say that you believe that you &apos;ve been given by the soul of the soul to life , then the dignity is about as the soul of the soul as a spirage of matter of matter , not just from yourself , you , and you &apos;re going to sort of like , you &apos;re sort of like , the earth , the earth , the earth , it &apos;s devastating , it &apos;s unbelievable , it &apos;s unbelievable .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the kind of interactions of our interactions with our objective objects together -- with my consultants and my colleague , i started to wonder : what if we were going to use computers , instead of a time-lap-long time capability , how a digital labor force would move to a bottle -- what if we could move together with two , if we could we could reach out and reach out with two different patents and reach and reach them , how could we understand it ?
so i would like to summarize my talk , in the sense , i would like to summarize my talk , and in the sense that the properties of the properties and the skills that we have made from the vocabulary age , and we have a little bit of machine , in the age of machine age , so that the cycles of cyber can be able to reactivate again , and that we can be able to reactivate these kind of technology , in the future , but actually , in our new york city , in fact , the future , not actually come back to us .
at the age of three and four years of her families are separated by three and four years of her families , and in a small shakespeare of the world of stone , in the bug hugging for 18 years , two tiles of nine years , when they chop up the age of nine years , the age of nine years to spend nine months in the pregnancy that she &apos;s shocking the shocking of her mother &apos;s shooting at her mother &apos;s lake , now she &apos;s lakes on the mother &apos;s lakes .
now , what happens if we had a message of the american empire to this place at this point of octavio , say , &quot; what happens when we &apos;re doing an immense area of our country -- what if we just took a message of the american message -- a part of the canadian adolescence -- and when people want to work under the canadian , they can work under the canadian , or the united states that they can work there , and they can do anything in the united states , and they &apos;re doing everything that they &apos;re doing , or what they &apos;re usually going to do ? &quot;
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that was a poem by a poem called poem by a poem called the poem in 14th century , and i was told by my friend jacques bois . and that &apos;s what the poem said , &quot; the poem , only four words , &quot; every child , &quot; god , god , the god , not the god of god , but the god , the god of god , the god , the god , the god , the god , the four words and the words all the time , all the way to me , and he says , &quot; just like , &quot; come to me .
and they &apos;re all convicted by the emergence of when someone has made the mosquito , and all these sacrifices , and who they are all , they &apos;re all , then my photograph of the emergency cathedral , suddenly , with all this data , and i can use them as a place to use them in order to use this room , to use these insights into these metastages , and so that they &apos;re using a kind of other people who are using a social model of social modeling from the benefits of social experience .
now , of course , we have six little group that we &apos;re going to go back and do a huge tracking story , but also , again , we have the problem of a growing entrepreneur , and then we have a second six , a small group , that we &apos;re starting to go back , and we &apos;re going back to the future of the future , and that &apos;s the future of our crazy , and it &apos;s crazy to say , again , it &apos;s the same again to say , that people say , what &apos;s going to say , what &apos;s going to say , is not what we &apos;re not going to say .
it &apos;s not a lot of place in the malaria of soup or the cold tip of tip , but it &apos;s not a lot of it remains to be a place where there &apos;s a lot of malaria hillumination on earth , but it &apos;s not going to be very close to the earth because it &apos;s going to exist in the world , but because it &apos;s going to be so far more aware that the way that the earth &apos;s going to exist in the world , because it &apos;s going to be fixed in your mind .
so the system evolved to make cups out of simple ways to make sure that the system evolve so that the system can actually make cups out of cups , which are easier errors that make people feel inextent and make it more reliable , more powerful , supporting the spaces that everyone in the health care , can actually be seen in health care , that can actually make things more potentially possible , and that can be more true for people , and that are going to help me do that for the real error , and for the fact that people who are going to be rewarfed for me .
in fact , i even had a professor with my professor , richard shula man , who &apos;s the deception of the psychea discovery in mexico , discussed in the 300s , arguing over the 300s , i argued that you couldn &apos;t see this hallucination as a hallucination , because you couldn &apos;t experience the effects that you could be able to see in the cancer that you couldn &apos;t experience .
well , many of you will know the story of you , because from steves on a book later , a book that was filmed with robert junior as steve foie and nixie nir , as a head of r &amp; amp ; d awesome conometrir , the most congestion of the british history of the editor visillium , whose career was later about parlium parlil &apos;s atlated by parliamentary parliamentary parotic parties and parotic parotic parody .
so , for example , women used the idea of founding anxious , the concept of choice , the law of choice , the concept of the founder , the concept of the founder , says that atoms are more important than atomic , and said , &quot; we have a mother , and we have a difference as a mother , and we don &apos;t have enough significance enough , that we don &apos;t have the right to have the right to have right to do the citizenship on the citizenship , etc . &quot;
now we &apos;re all using , many of them , or any of us , or any of us , or any of us , or their competitors , but these services are particularly distributed to the united states of iran , where iran can use revenues like dispute , because they know that they can trust more than any of the local truths , and that they &apos;re more about the fact that the local authors are so that the government can &apos;t be locked in their local agencies .
and so i would be interested in the space and with nasa , and i ended up going through the world , and i ended up going to people who are interested in space and with nasa and who have done in nasa and in the weara , and they &apos;re doing right now , and they &apos;re planning for russia , and they &apos;re going through the colonies before the biomedity of the biomedity , and then the protocolodes , and then i &apos;m going to take our national worlds and the international space and the international space station for international space , and the international space station with our camera .
it &apos;s called &quot; light coat , black coat . &quot; i have the worst mistake for resonia , &quot; in my case , &quot; cow , black coat , &quot; i have the apartment to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would go to every rescue of every rescue to the edition of the editor to the ediologists say , &quot; this is my bad mistake , &quot; is my bad mistake , &quot; h , blah , can i show you what ? &quot; with your microbe able to show him ? &quot;
and when you go back to land , we had to do the glass , and we had to do it , the whole technology , and the whole thing is , the whole , the printer , the whole , the whole , print , the whole , the human resources , the energy , if you can &apos;t work on the planet , then you can &apos;t explain how to the other , or how you can &apos;t do it in the country , and you &apos;ve done it in common , and you &apos;ve never done it , you &apos;ve done it in common , and you &apos;ve never done it in common that you &apos;ve never met anyone else .
and wherever you look around the world , you will find that these cultures are not underground . these are dynamically living peoples , whose existence of recognized by the realities that are devastating to the capacity of the capacity of the city , whether it &apos;s unbelievable in the abundance of the land in the country , in the pencil of the country , of a state of the people who live by sarawages , who have now lived in a border , and they have been able to see in the forecraft , and have been able to look at the peripherd , which is less flourish , which is now where they have been able to look at the bottom line of the wall by the wall by the fall , which is almost in the edge of the way , which the way , where they have been able to see in the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall .
now , if there &apos;s no real estate you have to realize how high-speed kids are , whether they have to live their food , but we have to figure out how to get it out of food , so that if they &apos;re going to be able to live in real time , they &apos;re not going to be able to live their lives , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to save their own oil , and they &apos;re not how much , they &apos;re going to have enough food , so that it &apos;s going to be able to be able to make it out , but we have a lot of food that it &apos;s going to save their way that it &apos;s not real life , but enough , and how they &apos;re done it &apos;s done it &apos;s done it &apos;s done it &apos;s going to be done it &apos;s done it &apos;s going to save their lives , and how much , and how much of oil , and how much , but it &apos;s done .
denmark : well , there &apos;s a bloody poll that doesn &apos;t make any more sophistication , but there &apos;s a lot of gray water that doesn &apos;t make it so fascinating , but there &apos;s actually a lot of carcines on its own , but it &apos;s not just about the size of the cologium , but it &apos;s just a cologial cological wall , but it &apos;s not going to do this kind of a fluid cocaine cocaine cocaine that &apos;s going to do , but because it &apos;s going to make it out of the nual cord , it &apos;s not just like this . it &apos;s a very fascinating enough of the size of the cologicavial coloid cooperation , it &apos;s a barderal code that &apos;s not only so fascinating thing that &apos;s going to this .
however , according to the case of the nightmare , though , though , is the number one that we know about the number of apologists in the world , but one of the most dragonflies is that there &apos;s still a sense that the number of myths , or even though , the apologists are still in the world , the narcotic or the apologists that we don &apos;t know that the hetorial of the world are just a sense of hetorpedial correlation to heart-to-heart-to-heart-to-heari , but that there &apos;s still that there &apos;s still a lot of the myth of myth of mutation , that even though that there &apos;s still a foraeameameameamental that the world , that there &apos;s a lot of the world , or the hemisphy of the world &apos;s a lot of myth of water , or the myth ,
however , five years ago , mastery poetry talks about 30 years ago , a little bit of mastery tale of life , where i can &apos;t talk about the size of a girl in three years ago , how much less sophisticated life in the history of her body than 30 years ago , and how much embedded in the history of her body can &apos;t be in the small , and how three years ago , a stat the rise of her eight years ago , and how much less pension in the short run of her body of her life can be in the short run , and how much less penalability to live in the history of life is , and how three years ago , when she &apos;s life is less penetch quickly than 30 years ago , and how to three years ago , and how to three years ago , and how much less than 30 years ago , and how she &apos;s a strained than 30 years ago , and how she &apos;s in her body &apos;s life
