thank you .
from seattle ...
i don &apos;t know .
because that &apos;s singing .
but it goes .
don &apos;t find it .
yeah , hello .
we love innovation .
solar technology is ...
that &apos;s not ...
we were poor .
are all of these ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
after a week .
great trick ?
that &apos;s what we were .
a few less .
and he says ...
we know that .
ta-o !
twice .
here it is .
that &apos;s fast .
they need time .
music as a language .
that &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... not yet .
thank you .
what a fish .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
that &apos;s efficient .
wonderful , ok ?
completely inefficient .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much .
come on .
the only opportunity .
no hospital .
thank you very much .
stephen watts .
three out of 10 .
that was incredible .
thank you . thank you .
yeah , sort of like .
it &apos;s terrible .
long , yes .
fantastic , right ?
the sun goes to the sun .
oh my god .
we love entertainment .
let &apos;s pick up .
where ?
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we lose them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
a whole lot .
sounds good ?
the whole environmental debate .
sounds familiar , what ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
that &apos;s great .
that was fascinating .
can i be honest ?
the farm is incredible .
what did they do ?
robert gupta .
that &apos;s the system .
that &apos;s what happens .
yeah , good day .
lento , slowly .
i &apos;m interested in this .
we can do that .
what do you say ?
not very sustainable .
yes , milliseconds .
that &apos;s our present .
they have similar principles .
yeah , good day .
good work ! yeah !
just do your job .
this was the result .
thank you very much .
and she did .
so you meet al .
it &apos;s essential .
they &apos;re all important .
very different term .
extremely exciting .
that &apos;s actually me .
darkness is blank .
yeah , that &apos;s what goes .
flying cat .
this is the last .
can we change it ?
these days are over .
these people make money .
what happened here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
reviewed them .
and that &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know .
centers were built .
what happened here ?
but you know what ?
what was the result ?
i was amazed .
it &apos;s generic .
so they knew everything .
you could see manhattan .
here &apos;s the video .
it has sensors .
why no longer life ?
he opens the door .
a few more .
that &apos;s very good .
oh , that &apos;s the one .
there is no normal .
yeah , i know .
pretty good , right ?
but you know what ?
i have a question .
okay . thank you .
i was standing in love with him .
players are not sitting around .
so you can do that .
they &apos;re bad . &quot;
so let &apos;s see .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work .
what do these people need ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i was thinking about it .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
they use their hands .
so how does this work ?
how they are interested .
that would have been okay .
what are media today ?
you can go in .
so where do we go ?
so it &apos;s true .
how do we know that ?
because you know what ?
it &apos;s not a country .
why do we do that ?
not very often happens .
bg : thank you .
this is a wish .
and i was an artist .
let &apos;s call him don .
not guilt .
and it has to go back .
we can do it differently .
they even do hurt .
and i understand that .
it &apos;s a tremendous challenge .
there is no food .
it &apos;s against justice .
but the wrong things .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
i &apos;m a writer .
here &apos;s another example .
i forgot children .
it feels great .
i swear it .
i wonder .
it &apos;s not going to do it .
thank you for listening .
why should we do that ?
thank you .
here &apos;s an example .
you can see it immediately .
not toxic .
but i continued to work .
or maybe bombs .
i &apos;m going in here .
there are two ways to be done .
we need energy miracles .
why is this happening at all ?
oh . a moment .
let me tell you .
what do you want to do ?
this is what &apos;s happening today .
and i continued to work .
so she was back .
and so it was .
yeah , here it is .
i agree with you .
and why is that ?
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what would it have to be done ?
i mean the soul .
you do the same thing .
in china it was different .
luckily , right ?
but that &apos;s not a protection .
ofa &apos;s opportunity .
does anybody see anything there ?
and i always had that .
very expensive mobilization .
people were playing crazy .
what &apos;s the illusion ?
my building feeling again .
after just a journey there .
first of all , constraints .
i created one .
yeah . all right .
imagine the camera .
jk : both .
but it gets worse .
so here you see it .
thank you very much .
be a mentor .
maybe 10 times as many .
but it didn &apos;t .
the data came in .
this is a great question .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
it has billions of them .
did you see these guys ?
but there &apos;s something else .
here &apos;s another example .
is it even photography ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
ohhh .
and then it became international .
there were remixes .
let me wrap up .
okay , a few more .
the answer to that is no .
just further . much fun .
my name is amit .
he had the experience .
it keeps you fresh .
this is a great question .
is that your opinion ?
a almost identical structure .
and it got even better .
that &apos;s what they did .
it has really enjoyed him .
here you see the city .
good afternoon , everybody together .
am i going to like the color ?
ooh , thank you .
some have left and gone .
i don &apos;t think more of it .
dk : 60,000 .
there &apos;s an old study .
don &apos;t be discouraged .
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s not for emotions .
he &apos;s called paul offers .
what do you think happened now ?
who will make it safer ?
first , we have the population .
i don &apos;t like this question .
but what do your fish eat ?
let &apos;s also call him don .
this is bills .
the work of the interpreted .
but where are we useful ?
they had no mass media .
how do we actually work people ?
... his own story .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
so what does that mean ?
now , what does that mean ?
privacy has to be given .
there &apos;s online criminals .
we have three main groups .
it was still fish .
he always showed up here .
and then it happened again .
i felt really good .
and many people forget that .
crisis . death . disaster .
it would be intolerable .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
it &apos;s not our problem .
we lost touch .
why not think that ?
we love technology and creativity .
it would be intuitive .
we &apos;re constantly dissecting each other .
and this opens up a map .
but what do we do with it ?
that &apos;s about it .
what do i look at ?
his name is tempt .
is it going to have my size ?
that sounds crazy , right ?
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
we need to spread the message .
most of you know this .
you also have to understand that .
this is what you see down there .
i want to ask you something .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
i find that fascinating .
i find that fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was destroyed on the ground .
they look like this .
is it about light ?
i grew up in india .
this is the shoreline .
you see the water coming .
i had a good life .
so what happened years after that ?
who are these relatives ?
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
these changes are going on .
how about fitness ?
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
but the key thing is ...
he works like this .
and then they set up .
what happened there actually ?
the orange one is called anger .
they really loved it .
but i felt bad .
the two smell call me .
yes , legendary technology .
very frightening .
what &apos;s the soul ?
we don &apos;t produce more ourselves .
i can claim everything .
he went up and down .
what can we do ?
this is what the chart looked like .
i &apos;m going to go to the end .
maybe that &apos;s the reality of reality .
it may sound rubble .
we were 20 people .
so we &apos;re too many of them .
you can &apos;t have bone bones .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
or is it possible ?
it comes from conflicts of creativity .
so what do we need to do ?
they didn &apos;t have books .
this is felix .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
thank you for your attention .
that was the beginning of the journey .
i &apos;m honestly honored .
and then everybody went down .
they saw the great impact .
first injuries , second .
well , i was the next one .
let &apos;s face it -- who &apos;s normal ?
and finally , epic meaning .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
the same thing , only bigger .
who &apos;s most successful ?
you want to feed the world ?
i wanted to support them .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
i just loved two .
the place is south korea .
again , you &apos;ve got it again .
this is such a natural thing .
my wife told me she was telling me .
and how did that feel ?
that &apos;s because you can train .
do you mind the curious thing ?
so it &apos;s n circle .
so what &apos;s the idea of hacking ?
this was happening around christmas .
what is that for a thing ?
that &apos;s how you know .
you could have done it better .
the answer is yes .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
and that &apos;s nothing else .
is that reasonable ?
so that &apos;s the good news .
it was a huge success .
so they saw something magical .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
but no problem can be a problem .
they always say , why ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
it was just not invented yet .
so , you know , ambition should work .
anybody know what that is ?
for example , this perception in context .
this is a game out for outside .
this is god , you know ?
but it was very sad .
so let me remind you .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
and is the chex .
sometimes i push too much .
but they do the job .
they connected these two people .
her mother put her on her own .
okay , there are some .
think about your own decisions .
this picture is from this place .
i see this plunk sign .
and it took 18 months .
tell me about this world .
this is very risky .
and that worked very well .
and again , the jazz showed him four .
i learned everything out .
and there are hundreds of them .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there &apos;s good news .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
it really made me sad .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
but it &apos;s not that fast .
how can we help you ? &quot;
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
no , no , there was a possibility .
the story is not over yet .
what happened that day ?
well , we want to .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
that &apos;s how you feel . &quot;
they come from the artists .
i shouldn &apos;t say that .
the power plant can explode .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
she did it for three years .
you can have these cloud .
the data was not available before .
play is not silly .
now , how could that happen ?
is this all involved in education ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
so that &apos;s what we can do .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
everybody is talking about happiness today .
don &apos;t taste very well .
play doesn &apos;t just play child games .
and that was 19 years ago .
what would you like most ?
they create a epic story .
they have so much uncertainty .
the data is constantly lighting .
nobody ever said that before .
so paul is a terrorist .
and that &apos;s what he actually says .
don &apos;t take anything like that .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what should our permission look like ?
this is a lot of volume .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
i never cook with it .
she was back and die .
and of course , that &apos;s incredible .
and here &apos;s the picture .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
a autistic student .
when it &apos;s in the moment , it &apos;s garbage .
so not like detox .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re taking .
we depend on two countries .
everybody needs a goldfish glass .
let me be here . &quot;
people were still happy .
it was my first sunset .
actually , he collected fish .
my name is brian goldman .
they share their experiences with others .
the white lines are for population .
that &apos;s why i made the movie .
he showed up on the algae .
it &apos;s just not technological .
there are four and a half thousand people living .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
every case is nutrient .
and we &apos;re too many of them .
so the question is : how ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and it was an unbelievable experience .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
but there are two problems with this .
i started feeling better .
but , you know what ?
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
that was great dios .
i talk a lot about these questions .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
that &apos;s it , just right .
we &apos;re in an area .
and that &apos;s what we did .
they basically do the same thing .
this is one of the images .
what other brands are doing this ?
and then something weird happened .
you can play with different kinds of games .
the whole building was made out of water .
italy wins . yeah .
on the morning , the game .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
the creativity had to get out of the way .
nowadays , it &apos;s all easy to have .
the nurse asked the nurse .
i should not be doing that .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
and it starts with a doctor .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
we use the energy of the sun .
these are all metadata .
because i can claim everything .
it will always be similar to you .
but slowly it &apos;s fine .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work , isn &apos;t it ?
what are you trying to do ? &quot;
we &apos;re not going on .
what lessons have we learned ?
and the form plays a role .
you can &apos;t store energy .
then i can translate the whole thing .
okay , that &apos;s really courage .
once we started a vibrant .
my second mistake was worse .
and she likes a 257 .
we all love baseball , right ?
somehow , kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
that &apos;s about five meters long .
they &apos;re going to be free in the computer .
because anybody here has masks ?
and then react to him .
other things shouldn &apos;t suffer from other things .
this one has the biggest effect .
the movement of writing it .
anyway , not to navigate .
and that &apos;s all at the beginning .
the truth is more like this .
do you want jeans with holes ?
so you can &apos;t do anything .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
her family gathered up .
thank you very much for your patience .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
what else is risky ?
just be who you are .
i remember my first fire .
what &apos;s a story about ?
dark in urine . dark .
so i tried to do a little bit of a thing .
but really , really , really ?
but we need the whole thing .
llemissions , yes ?
this is totally trivial .
let &apos;s take this over .
hmmm , my brand ?
this is scary .
this sounds frightening .
next : nuclear energy .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
i really wanted to make a difference at that time .
now , i &apos;m going to show you this .
as soon as the judge saw me .
we can &apos;t just do that .
so i went to the court .
i got some fear of technology .
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
and there are several reasons for this .
they sell certificate .
but it &apos;s not documented .
why did i go to medicine ?
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s rapidly growing up .
all adults were aware of the risks .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i like things that are different .
i went to jail -- difficult .
this didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
this is a child game , right ?
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
and this video is real time .
the game starts -- switzerland .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
what about longevity ?
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
so the correlation is lower .
so , look what happens .
and this has really changed the dynamic .
so i just started playing .
and then we said , okay .
yes , these are the data .
i &apos;ll shoot a little bit by the head .
have you ever been dish ?
it &apos;s learning how to learn .
because for me , it means memory .
how and what does he feel ?
we say in germany , sustainability .
so you can &apos;t solve that at all .
music is medicine . music is changing .
it turns out that it &apos;s really difficult .
and you know what i learned ?
these are becoming inconsistent .
but what &apos;s going to happen in the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
it has nothing to do with science .
and that can make a big difference .
but there &apos;s another reason .
anyway , we need a solution .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
so i &apos;m listening to many , thank you .
they escape .
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
we started out 15 years ago .
how far do you get there at all ?
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
do you know what neither is ?
so the first step to make a interpretation .
and still , it &apos;s not a interpretation .
that must be the aging difference .
if you come to that , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
this is just the minimum .
we can extract our nutrients .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
on the book and on the picture .
this picture reminded me of something .
i find them abundant .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
i want to prove that to you .
it was a pretty fortunate project .
here he leaves the sun .
this affects the memory .
these rivers are too small .
a has these benefits and risks .
our newspapers are read by millions .
lego made it possible for everyone .
privacy is not about debate .
they were genetically refined .
i &apos;m the new defined doctor .
i don &apos;t take the same way .
baseball is full of great statistics .
because we live on a water planet .
do we really want to go in this direction ?
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
and these are the neural structures .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
oh , my time has been over ?
there &apos;s something going on in my mind .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
so we measured his movement .
this is a picture of the objective .
apparently it was quite popular .
you see something fun here .
i really like beautiful clothes .
it can only use its eyes .
but the truth is far away .
you can do this all the time .
so this crazy story might agree .
who would ever wish to wish ?
the defeat would have been too simple .
her father died shortly after her birth .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a cents .
we need to increase the complexity slowly .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
here &apos;s your margin .
it &apos;s supposed to eradicate experience .
but then they really want to go deep inside .
you want to orientate in the museum ?
that was more to emphasize .
okay , do you really want to know ?
and i had to get away from the city .
we won some awards .
who doesn &apos;t want to healthier children ?
it makes cheese with kids .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
no , i mean it &apos;s really serious .
i hold that in my hand .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going back my sleeve .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
now i see greg leather .
a billion people are going to be hungry today .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
i loved this fish .
no , no , no , it &apos;s not .
and that sounds completely different than it was before .
he was already over sixth .
i started building a institute .
they even bring financial services in .
the movie was not yet delivered .
we need to think about what brands are .
what are you doing with this ? &quot;
i call this the radiant tiger .
we &apos;ve been waiting for 1994 .
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
this is ideology , not science .
and this led me to ...
today , 6.8 billion people are living .
it &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s going to come .
it &apos;s bushing with chalk .
the hot projects today .
automatically , he &apos;s walking to the right thought .
that &apos;s how natural things are presented .
but it requires a lot of planning .
we can reinvent everything again .
in the way we think of north .
and the one on the phosphorus .
in the third way , the third one is to forget .
it &apos;s longer than these two other networks .
the rocks are colored .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
it &apos;s about changing values .
i started with my usual talk .
this is a very sensitive question .
i learned that from my grandmother .
now , let &apos;s do this with airplanes .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
we haven &apos;t written this app .
and every morning i jumped on it .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
it &apos;s very good .
so what would you describe to ?
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
there are also world record .
to ask , what is the right thing ?
people are talking about the urine .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
the living spike is the spirits .
they gave their blood pressure up .
thank you , but the best part is coming .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
happy productivity . fantastic !
the result of that was catastrophic .
and everybody in this room has to go in .
here &apos;s the olive oil .
bjign sundin .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
&quot; risk is not a simple game .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
i think there are possibilities everywhere .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
we &apos;ve done a lot of procedures .
this may be opened .
my brother stared at me .
so these are the apple saras .
i talked a lot about magic .
who could have done it all ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who do you actually want to inform it ?
completely on a particular goal .
what do you think happens next ?
they have them . they always have .
so that &apos;s a tough one .
it &apos;s now rejected .
they &apos;ve literally laid out the levers .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
most of all , if he &apos;s already died .
so there are two circles .
the side product is clean water .
this sounds very unusual .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you always lose the rare animals .
it &apos;s going to touch you .
he died walking through the story .
here &apos;s how the building works .
they went through each other .
tell me what you &apos;re feeling .
the other one had a strong diarrhea .
let &apos;s make a little picture of this .
here you have this little mechanism .
he &apos;s signed up .
the one who is interested in the firemen .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
the students are divided into notes .
these things are logically correct .
and here it is .
for energy , i fell in love with this .
i tried to understand them .
all these generations need a few milliseconds to do just a few milliseconds .
and nobody seems about that , no one seems to rain up .
that i had written these crazy things .
so men can &apos;t be a pig .
this is just a little bit less destruction .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
this is also a paradigm shift .
it &apos;s a dalmatinier , right .
you can see from the back to the front .
so from modern to the computer society .
and that &apos;s what they do .
we have to get far out , quickly .
it &apos;s about a new supply of america .
they &apos;re all embarrassing questions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they &apos;re the homegrown countries of someone .
we are running through initiational rituals .
now look at this curve .
jokes are simply among our lives .
i forgot people in death row .
they were inspired by this .
leaders maybe some mutations .
so scott gets this frustration .
we worked up to late the night .
so i followed my gut feeling .
he went back to the silence .
now we saw the reverse effect .
they all have applaud .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
so ... doesn &apos;t mean that optimistic .
he switches off .
let &apos;s start with the real one .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
they had a concept of blue blood .
i believed that everybody could do that .
i never met him personally .
even cats look at this video .
there was jimmy kimpaired .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
how would you describe your brand ?
we talk about kisses , fresh .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
no , that was what i thought .
i &apos;m a redundancy person .
that &apos;s not the route .
this is a painting of a circle .
the roof was also covered with water .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
and women did the most successful thing .
we can support them , to be good .
look at what she does .
the main man winds me up .
sexual planting to the picture .
i &apos;m going to read you the post .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
that &apos;s the truth . i believe that .
we &apos;re talking about the tank of this .
it was really immensely deep .
he popped his head , no .
this is going to happen in the next april .
we also got very accurate data .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but with the right design , please .
we can support them , to be good .
alone , what is information ?
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
there was never a time before like this .
and even lomborg thinks about it .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
and also , these sources are interrupted .
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
this is an ecological network .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
i am an expert in relationships . &quot;
the chef had it charged .
you can think of the box .
this is such a contract .
that &apos;s what &apos;s just been represented .
what takes five thousand milliseconds to do ?
i see the dalmatinier .
it might take up until it is .
maybe again , you have to look back at this .
no , no , no , much more feathers .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
156 nations send our tv channel .
they tap into their internet connection .
but today , we are far beyond this .
she wasn &apos;t drunk .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
that &apos;s the system in which we live .
but i was looking at these questions .
and that was what i felt .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
what will these three billion people bring in ?
you should give them what wishes .
something very strange happens here .
and that was the outbreak of the error .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
it can know how we hold it .
so it creates a feedback .
in boston , not only has a hill center .
this is a very small app .
the ufer of one place .
&quot; they didn &apos;t let them go . &quot;
i lived in parallel worlds .
someone made a old-fashioned version of it .
and i want to read to you the preferences .
there is another aspect of history .
you can be logical and intuitive .
tell me a little bit about this part .
make it possible -- all of you here .
pace today is completely paralyzed .
does anybody know what that is ?
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
it &apos;s called &quot; i jump . &quot;
let me tell you a little bit about this .
now , the circumstances of this kind don &apos;t exist in us .
we &apos;ll come back to these guys later .
we can cheat ourselves like this .
so the first exciting thing .
and there is in some ways .
daniel kahneman : sure .
everyone would like to make people happier .
the dose also plays a role .
and why ? genetic food changed .
it &apos;s too millions of people .
we have masks in this country now .
not even the truth is it &apos;s going to be free .
because now you can apply a sentence .
you can see the timeline up .
in many cases , these people are totally healthy .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
thank you , danny kahman .
we get an absolutely flat line on this .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
because we don &apos;t want to get rid of genes ?
we don &apos;t want firms to own companies .
the guy in the middle not so much .
you run the process , you understand it .
there are some things that need to come together .
and then what do you do with the garbage ?
bad ? i was completely confused .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and then he can run away .
a particularly beautiful story , like me .
his personal versions of erosion .
i &apos;m going to try and do this for a precede .
it has to work first as a present .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
this is an annual water flow .
we have thousands of organisms to do that .
it &apos;s a little virus kills bacteria .
now this level of intuition is very important .
so litton &apos;s open source .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
they grow five centimeters .
maybe i did it with good reason .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
let &apos;s pull something out now .
it all comes out of our own bags .
ordinary people are not available to these devices . &quot;
as an artist , the relationship is very important .
here you see roberto dancing .
and anyway , italy won the end of it .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
but the game is a format .
thank you . i have a question to ask .
he had 20 minutes of glorious music .
now , i &apos;m going to show you .
that &apos;s just an insurance method .
it should recontain the two elements .
shake the environment , make less garbage .
but i &apos;ll get to talk about that again .
yes . it doesn &apos;t make any other than discover .
the goal of the whole movie is transparency .
a language is a expression of the human mind .
it was a barrier .
what you need is a new medical culture .
alone , your support , your support and support .
do you want to come in and listen ? &quot;
i think our identity is threatened .
many of my clients are very young .
my cousins were all over the place .
we saw some amazing representations .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
here are two different dirty issues .
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i &apos;ve got him on my laptop here . &quot;
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist .
a whole bunch of cool food .
the difference then is perceived as loss .
in two hours , they rebuild all the time .
the emergency shelter has all the strands .
no insurance can make a decision .
there &apos;s a lot of great books to this issue .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputer .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
you can predict that . why is that ?
what kind of application do i do ?
it &apos;s great that this number is going up .
not half a quarter or a quarter ? &quot;
so what can we conclude from all this ?
so basically , one of the translation of translation .
no tree is carbon neutral .
and further , now look at him .
the next step happened now in this communities .
he had a lot of natural videos .
by the way , this is just the workforce .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
it really solves the fuel problem .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
this is one , a part of her .
it just wasn &apos;t that , do you know ?
in other areas -- the world of communication .
this is my supermarket . no big .
but western governments are helping themselves .
sleep deprivation is ubiquitous .
i &apos;m going to be tired of how we all .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
if you burn coal , no .
tell them , there &apos;s no prediction .
can you play them in blue now ?
no , we figure out what &apos;s inside .
and there &apos;s a central dot at that .
i mean , everyone has eaten .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
what are the archaic models right now ?
and the list can continue to continue .
so , that was my primary motivation .
new america . find more .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we asked them , and nobody knew it .
my mom called me a few minutes after that .
monday : color is something more powerful .
it &apos;s given us a certain amount of session .
and then it looks like this .
do you remember the winch ?
so , help me do a little bit of that .
imagine mozart &apos;s kind of efficient .
i &apos;m happy i &apos;m there .
the waters have been expanding .
they make it worse for us to stand there .
man 3 : i &apos;m the scholar guy .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a lip .
now , the instruments have evolved .
i want to quickly explain this a little bit .
in fact , a viral video didn &apos;t want to make a viral video .
in this three-sentence , three sentences come in front of you .
thirty-four , you &apos;re still familiar with this school .
you can zoom in and zoom in .
now , i add a bass .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
if not , well , somebody else today .
this is the machine below geneva .
the new chromosome went to the cell .
they laughed more than what they do here .
you know , your problem is you have too little .
thirdly , escalating the expectations .
the official dogma of what ?
you just listen to them and then start talking .
let me show you how you work .
it &apos;s a game that &apos;s called the assumption .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
we &apos;re thinking today about energy scarcity .
that &apos;s what thank you . thank you .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
you go around and you feel rubble .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
this is something that &apos;s built in the city .
second time . end of the normal time .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
just imagine that for a moment .
raise your hands . let me see .
maybe we can see jokes as change .
dumb is not much better .
people suffered . people fought .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
you know , science is not a company .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so , this really blew me up .
i tried to preserve the body .
life had not changed since centuries .
but so many of them got over the years .
my grandmother never forgotten me about his life .
my fourth technique : making complexity for complexity .
the third technique : categorizing .
it takes a thousand square miles .
you come in two ways -- very simple .
you should tell me something about my brand .
it was something we knew to do .
but reality is always unpredictable .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
thursday : confidence is the key .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
i wanted to rebuild the health of a disease .
now , if you think about a piece of paper .
what ? it really made me flip on .
we reject genetic food .
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
we &apos;ve forced them . puff .
my parents are 80 on the ferences .
and there &apos;s the storage problem .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
you can jump directly to a certain outbreak .
you can type in a particular year .
because this is so evidence , right ?
shake the environment , use less energy .
this is the so-called osit-sized model .
now you see the dalmatiner .
and the two of them are also here today .
yes , i was scared of all these things .
it &apos;s got to go down here , down to zero .
but i didn &apos;t get involved in it .
it &apos;s great , but i fell in love .
amazingly , he was still alive .
and in time , you can react to others .
our goal was to just say , okay .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go again .
all of that is composting of that .
it &apos;s all in there , it &apos;s useful .
this is going to happen in china in a second .
the phosphorus problem is much critical .
in every case , they do that .
the permanent ice is labeled with red .
and if not , still dance your dance .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
seriously -- the default !
now , this cartoon makes some say .
here &apos;s some on the hampton .
so that &apos;s how supermarket is .
i thought i could integrate .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the three words say , do you remember ?
i remember when it was yesterday .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
well , i went to the court .
i said , &quot; ok , oma . &quot;
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition dot .
i work in the solar panels .
and let me show you a simple example .
but it has an unexpected waste .
so that made sense , it fed together .
and yet , we seem to be happy with that .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
scott taught himself to human .
and here &apos;s every piece of very well .
after that , it &apos;s all about the combination of different images .
is it about the details or the colors ?
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
no one has to be fooled ideas .
motors , gear -- four possibilities .
i think maybe i &apos;ve heard more hands .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
eeeeeeee ! no , thank you !
and this is a millionaire .
so at this point , we need digital security systems .
so again , the fittest really well together .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
intersexuality comes in many different forms .
so they &apos;re going to save them ; they &apos;re saving the shoes .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
what we want to do is create the future .
i &apos;m living in the real life of this feedback .
there &apos;s a lot of happy coach .
let me show you just a little bit about it .
it &apos;s kind of like a potatoes .
damages . shame .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
they were just like the people in this room .
my grandparents urged this number on 70 .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
we need to use more research for ourselves .
there &apos;s every footprint there .
usually i would take the needle now .
there was someone sitting in the back who had no childhood .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand that .
let &apos;s do this as if we had a machine here .
what do you think happened with these design students ?
this is going to be a key element of this kind .
they live with the help of chemosynthesis .
i was totally excited , you know .
now i &apos;m going to choose the theme of government .
and every night , they fly 240 kilometers back .
every morning , they fly 240 miles to the farm .
how is the forecast ? &quot;
natural light then comes up with smarter .
no one &apos;s ever done this in the world .
so picasso is waiting , just wait .
we always create new tensions and conflicts .
that the issue of ecology is a global one .
now i &apos;m going to do something more powerful .
they &apos;re all back on their way back .
and they had to remove what we did .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we only signed up .
but here &apos;s what they should have been thinking .
that &apos;s how you can &apos;t get them wrong .
what do you do with certificate ?
this is alfred gonzalz .
there can be a series of changes .
and this is very important in medical research .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
then he whispered me into the ear .
the rest of the time , they &apos;re morocco .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask major questions .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
the question is why people accept this .
and i got back to work .
it &apos;s being connected by oxygen and sighted .
and we are increasing our expectations all the time .
and then i ask myself , how could that happen ?
first of all , i thought that was a game .
the storytellers always need more senses .
and try it again with a different generation .
today , a lot of people gave up the government .
the next week , the market comes to the market .
it &apos;s a button , it &apos;s got a button .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
i mean , no one has ever seen a particle .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the leadership .
the first one is a classic , apple .
it &apos;s the way i want to be .
these things have a positive impact .
no one wanted to do something with the movie .
what do you think the answer will be ?
on the left , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s why i think we need to be leaders .
so we have this horrible idea .
so two pairs , every single baby .
ladies and gentlemen , their relatives .
it &apos;s only one of the test of survival and success .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
the best one is coming -- in one second .
so every concert is a different concert .
so not saving , preventing , avoid .
and everything is packaging or content .
i could park in front of my house right now . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
it &apos;s supporting other people &apos;s mistakes .
i made them and made them come to the treatment .
do you know how to call a 4,000-pound ?
notice two things about this curve .
and i have to say , there was power .
my mother was the youngest of her children .
at 16 , i began to illustrate books .
that our contribution to the system is choose .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
he &apos;s not out in other countries yet .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
i never want to change anything in life .
so i spoke at a conference a few months later .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- that &apos;s how their fingers walk .
i want to show you something first .
and of course , it &apos;s done , but it &apos;s done .
it was summer , and i had readers .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
and they &apos;re not only going to die of masks .
what happened is that we could do that .
they don &apos;t invest in maverick &apos;s time .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . i said .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
anyway , that &apos;s what i want to do .
technical circles are the same way .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge to nine .
i was particularly looking at him here .
at the beginning , the tribal society is the language .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to the people .
we don &apos;t acquire identity ; we invent it .
it was much less , and i was in iron .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
now , everyone &apos;s trying to recognize something out of this pattern .
he came to me and hugged me .
all of them were like this , they began to divide .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you do it crazy ?
the land on earth would roll it up .
so smartness , a huge issue everywhere .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
i &apos;ve learned very simple things in my work .
we want to do something about death penalty companies .
there are some interesting developments .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet , there &apos;s a realistic level .
so to the subject of the day , funding .
actually , no , that was not the mistake at all .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
and we still need to improve a lot of that device .
it happened four and a half years ago in italy .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
this is a problem that many players have .
the last three of the five i &apos;ve summarized .
so let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
take those trips , triggered the rest .
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
all right , what &apos;s the brand name ?
i want to help you calm down .
both of them are survival , both of them .
as i said , amanda wears our elephants .
there was no canal peers .
have you taken all tomorrow &apos;s vitamins ?
so that was a very strange experience .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
we &apos;ve already got 20 percent in germany .
there &apos;s all these wind rings around it .
information is any difference that makes a difference .
the only thing they had was their head .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
this is a dead turtle .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
i have something that i want to show you .
how about living in good health ?
we don &apos;t want companies to patent life .
and i found it incredibly exciting .
they have the flow of the water reverse .
so we can &apos;t do these things .
in the countries where people come to the money .
and what does it look like ?
we understood that the weather is global .
and in this head , the memory would remain .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is a completely unsustainable development .
it has a molecular weight of 300 million .
every one of my neighborhoods is gone .
that means we need to get back phosphorus .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
there seems to be an imperative .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 1,000 years .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
now they understood the advantage of the prototype .
that &apos;s the u.s. army for hundreds of years .
i think first of all , it &apos;s the curiosity .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
but maybe you can also disagree with them .
but today we &apos;re only talking about the biological systems .
not all of which to be compatible , of course .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
and we see that it &apos;s going through .
because it doesn &apos;t feel real money .
yeah , so what should be biohacking ?
here are some people who test it .
the fact is , coal is not dirty .
there &apos;s the ones that are much more spatial .
the headquarters of the headquarters are right here .
and i thought he &apos;d have kidney stones .
and back to my upper doctor .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
we want to reduce the number of chimps .
the swiss is oftentimes .
the netherlands of dna was an interesting step .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
but what &apos;s happening with &quot; feature &quot; is different .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the labeling .
no apple has ever returned like this .
good night , south rats . &quot;
now , he &apos;s carrying a tracker into the scene .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and their movement .
if your job is dancing , dance .
so we accused about 50 of the magnets .
these are recordings of a six seconds .
but netherlands is not always that bad thing .
in our own countries , we would never do this .
they &apos;re going to be rare because we &apos;re going to catch them .
so you don &apos;t lose the animals very often .
all of this stuff is inevitable .
we have access to charity with exponential technology .
i still remember when it was yesterday .
and i &apos;m going to get a figure out in the book .
tell , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
so each of them was a little bit different .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
i put my job at 95 pounds .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
we found that it &apos;s really weird .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
the answer is likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
this is something like our camoufi .
so you can get the whole movement of that .
here are the results that we &apos;ve just got .
but how do you do that in practice ?
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
i don &apos;t want to get there . &quot;
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
that &apos;s the problem that i try to solve .
that &apos;s not how happy a person lives .
and you say , what &apos;s going on with these moments ?
... also , the dosights play a role .
i think many of you in the room probably know this trick .
yeah , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
and i &apos;ve got all kinds of little props here .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
well , i understand that . i do that .
the marshmallow has to be on its side .
it &apos;s really , really important that we get there .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
i &apos;m going to talk to you today about energy and climate .
these blocks bring us no money .
i can change the sequence as you walk around .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
for nathaniel , music means southeast .
so it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
because actually , this human being is not interested in evidence .
because we can &apos;t live without those lifelong life .
he just fails them and not himself .
why do i have to afford a little car ?
a phrase with his own atom .
it &apos;s hardly talked about interpretation in the beginning .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
it &apos;s sort of a way of beating .
the whole game is a game , i have to say .
or they didn &apos;t have a phototography .
and all of this leads us to a big question .
it &apos;s virtual reality . it &apos;s all without computers .
yes , what are we doing now ?
and the world in which we lived like this .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
if you generalize it , this is what happens .
and that was not a hard way to diagnose .
i was a forced student .
all right , really good , maybe a single star .
wealth , not debt , influencing the outcome .
she had the last word in any family business .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we use this word with these averages .
and in this case , it looked like a neighbor .
and it worked . it worked out for scott .
i met the decision to raise the u.s .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
and that was an experience in dehuh for me .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
this is just online -- no press , no tv .
or are they more like a down-trite ?
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
so what are we going to see in the movie ?
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
i want to tell you how we found this .
and that &apos;s the planning behind stuffy .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
every icberg has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
it &apos;s natal and it &apos;s just natal .
we have the passion of a diy innovators .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
thank you for coming to ted . thank you very much .
we want to create mass whites . &quot;
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
now we do this with drilling and machines .
this is the feedback center for service and information .
and we want to put this on a global scale .
we all have navigation systems in our cars .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
all right , let me show you a little bit more of it .
here we were , and this is the painting .
emc : &quot; welcome transparency . &quot;
there was a lot of crazy things going on .
from the bird age to the machine age .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same with the disability movement .
but are we going to do the best of our toys ?
8,000 players were playing the game for eight weeks .
so we have 1.5 billion players all over this .
you expect a extra billion players in the next decade .
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
but do you know what you don &apos;t have a right ?
i thought we &apos;re going to use the potters right now .
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
and so i then met a slightly unusual decision .
so my two passions flown away .
you do something that is actually a little bit different .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
i don &apos;t know who you know this picture .
i &apos;ll just agree , that &apos;s logical .
i think it seems important to forgive one .
the question of death penalty is an interesting question .
the child in me is really excited about this .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamics .
al is a hydrant in the boston city .
today i &apos;m going to tell you about unexpected discoveries .
the underwater part is made of a stone .
when i say reality , i mean the photo reality .
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
and how was that for you ? what was it successful ?
a little bit more about you , not that you are .
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
tuesday : adaptation will be completely overrated .
the dog ! i was linguistic .
would you like to become more attractive and self-conscious ?
she hardly breathed and walked blue .
the people in the side of the side are coming in .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
you need that , and we don &apos;t give it to you .
and some of it works , and some of it doesn &apos;t work .
so we run away , and where are we going ?
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
but you &apos;re not going to replace the phosphorus .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
we wanted to develop a learning tool for language learning .
i may have another 40 years of work in me .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
if you want to create them on the left between the images .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not perceived as a huge loss .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
this is the kind of teacher &apos;s shame .
there &apos;s also a whole lot of studies now .
and we learn trust and the rules of the game .
probably one of those numbers must be getting close to zero .
and i said , &quot; yes , very much . &quot;
you can say things that have impact around the world .
... if you want to show up the slide , please .
in the same way , i think , we &apos;re playing games today .
in each one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the aid doctor .
and i went over and i just stopped over .
it also shows up in other parts of the book .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
another picture of me , starennight .
these results have been achieved by several weeks .
this player is about a episode of a episode .
why do i do that ? what comes out of it ? &quot;
there &apos;s a program that maybe some of you know .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
you know that he was in 1835 .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of this yet .
my mom suffered from the boat .
these are the people that shape my view .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the borders .
we see that in all sorts of areas of human life .
and that &apos;s the same thing after three months .
it &apos;s right , morality , patental .
the main problem here is something like aids .
the logic doesn &apos;t say anything about reality .
i have a nice concrete example of this .
then i say , heart attacks , yes ?
and we often invent how we want to .
we &apos;re all born . we bring kids to the world .
his whole work process has changed .
i said , &quot; promises , oma . &quot;
it &apos;s suspicious and weird programs .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; government is change .
but the thing about this picture is a problem .
there are some places we can turn to .
we called it the digital water civil war .
because they have specialized skills .
so here are some natural fireflies .
the second factor is the service that we use .
and that changed my way of making films completely .
it &apos;s hard to overrate the destruction .
so you could feel comfortable being able to sell it .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
that means that ants weigh much more than we do .
and we can look at that now .
gee and quantum leonard coats .
so , go ahead and start inventing them .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
this is an idea that is worth spreading .
so imagine just two other small changes .
how many would be a good memory ?
and this is the message of the message .
so please stop playing a music .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any statement about what &apos;s going on .
the first two sentences that are logical .
in fact , we know something else is the case .
now that &apos;s not supposed to be a joke , but it &apos;s not .
do that once and then you learn the sentence .
we can persuade these things in different examples .
what we love is that we have the ability to do .
they moved to a natural concept .
so these women met , and they were just signing .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and we created an ipad app .
darling and sponsors have been rejected .
i want to share with you some of the puzzlecks .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you zoom in . you can actually go in .
you can see in all these museums here .
how much money is needed to save that ?
think about it . this reef is generic .
and if it doesn &apos;t , it doesn &apos;t do anything .
so we &apos;re starting with a win-thread drugs .
he says , &quot; willingness to pick up all this . &quot;
imagine a sound sweet aircraft .
it &apos;s an awful lot of errors .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to continue to develop ourselves .
this is another view on the tree of life .
they divided the kingdom to two .
this is one of the classical expressions of play .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
we didn &apos;t have children in this country yesterday .
and i took a while to figure that out .
we repeated these practice with the same undergraduate students .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
&quot; look at your bins , pink .
there &apos;s no overpopulation problem with trees .
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s been a change .
and the third area that really explains itself .
i &apos;m happy to talk to all of you .
every big picture is the beginning of a seamh .
you would not starve , and you know what ?
or are you more like a down-time tribe ?
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
that &apos;s the consequence that we need to ask .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
we don &apos;t want iran to build iran .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
wednesday : she &apos;s her internal child .
game is the kitt that keeps us away .
if you have something to give them , you give it now .
how would you like to be better than you are at the moment ?
they teach them to open themselves up .
antonian : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
and here are two patients . these are their records .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive trap .
i think that &apos;s true of every human on the planet .
those who make scientific argument are very little .
so , a climate change is going to be terrible for you .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
it grows in winter and shrinking in the summer .
not only bad , but worst of all time .
everybody knew , your genius was something ladder .
we repair them , we repair them .
and the world in which we &apos;re now looking like this .
but these are all roads in the u.s.a .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
child mortality has dropped about a tenth of child .
that &apos;s there , then that &apos;s coming back .
ok , manifesto is something that will eat half a billion people .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
we &apos;re going into the poor of placebo industry .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
where is the biggest interest , what is this really going on ?
furthermore , the energy epiphany is very important .
we went back to the base of the titanic .
because artists have a local relationship to lie .
and at all , you &apos;re working on a much less than i do .
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
i will never play anything like this moment .
it &apos;s &apos; reform of remedial behavior , right ?
and less usable or more friendly , it &apos;s friendly .
how can i make anything more friendly ?
i don &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
so how do we work when we pump in there ?
every society is predominated by a primate medium .
and these interactive portraits are each other .
we &apos;re now focused on the fourth generation of the fourth generation .
you may have heard that we have built watermarks .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
they get a model that comes out of the whole earth .
the grandfather of the old man &apos;s old man refused .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
the only problem with this is that she had 10 children .
so in other words , i first want to say what i want .
and i see the same process in combination of photos .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it &apos;s been looked at this year almost 200 million times .
they had 348 different kinds of marine melts .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction to it .
paralysis is a result of many choices .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
he described one of them as a very ordinary .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
there is one spot of the screen with leaves .
so the pygmy movement did it .
and there are projects like this one on every level of the government .
this year it &apos;s been looked like 50 million times .
but what about this day , this particular day ?
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
we should put the baker in the cage .
are they eight months old and monumental like seven ?
the living self has no voice in this choice .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
and in the world , everything made sense to me .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
dane , in a moment of heady .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
and no , it &apos;s not functioning or san francisco .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open up your doors ?
here &apos;s the current version of this one .
it was a extreme situation . you needed a extreme solution .
and that was sort of the first of people developed toys .
as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
they never get a job that they can &apos;t solve .
i mean , i rarely saw flags .
i take this hand . and here &apos;s the knife .
and the movie is called &quot; the want to make a difference . &quot;
now , in this area there &apos;s not a number of targets .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 code .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
well , we set out the mayor hole .
now , nowadays , we know everything about where our things come from .
france makes a gate . italy makes a case .
how do you judge people in their character ?
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggression .
he steel every fifth of my consciousness .
is it for other people or is it affecting us ?
so i say , let &apos;s start the world changing .
edward caova is a scientist .
right now , let &apos;s spend three billion hours a week playing online .
the biggest difference between you is the transition time .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
bg : an energy breakthrough is the most important .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t save yourself .
with pivot , you can dive into a decade .
but for many people , that &apos;s a little too radically .
so i &apos;ve cracked in my life many fish .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
in fact , the notes are very vague and unprecisely .
because we don &apos;t do things anymore .
there &apos;s going to be more to my glasses .
as i said , no doubt has just begun .
this is an interactive movie .
and ololina ! towards the case for you .
i &apos;m still going to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and everybody knew it worked like this , right ?
i would keep doing this work that i love .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
this is : &quot; get your finger on any light . &quot;
the next step was to find the apps for that .
we know another one where all the stations are made .
so you just go to google map .
what more metamorphosis did you run ?
so we don &apos;t have a budget like others .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money trying to look great .
this constant feedback is not true in real life .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and explain it .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
a research semester , for the subject of user interface .
i &apos;m also going to resolve what &apos;s in there .
they don &apos;t know anything in this goldfish glass . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great lady .
in the future , most crimes are going to play online .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
now it &apos;s on the red list of endangered species .
30 years ago , this would sound ridiculous .
but i really believe that there &apos;s something more to us .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of this communities .
the cellular communities started to abstract information .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital physical .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the rat .
&quot; don &apos;t go &quot; it turns out to be untrue .
i didn &apos;t know how to use this .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together .
also urban designers and building blocks are very interested .
there &apos;s not even online . there &apos;s no reach .
so that doesn &apos;t work at all for the memory itself .
our steps in the digitization of life were exponentially .
this is startling night , probably never seen this before .
so in the course of this discovery , i learned a lot .
as a child , i drew comic books and so forth .
if we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
that &apos;s right now our goal .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
we just got around like anything else .
many of them talk about 80 percent reduction in 2050 .
i was quite grateful to explore from the deep sea .
so if it &apos;s sound , there &apos;s no soul .
this is the hardest part in my talk , by the way .
i can &apos;t play like this today in 20 years .
both of them nailed to me , framed me .
so a lot of testosterone , but no reaction to it .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my fault .
1th is the highest thing i saw .
a &quot; manhattan project ? &quot; how do we get there ?
that &apos;s why the weighs to think about how to think .
these are spaces that can react to a human .
now , how do people die in such a hack ?
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and you can see this green point there in the middle .
i sell shells throughout the country , around the world .
this is my meat , and i can turn that around .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
no , that &apos;s just the right thing to do ?
many of them are covered by faces and so on .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
in both cases , it was operated , and it was okay .
she didn &apos;t have a treatable brain damage .
ethnosphere is the great legacy of mankind .
and the fish also had the fortune to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the anxiety of language .
it was the error crossed against drugs .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
there &apos;s more behind , and it &apos;s still deeper .
but we only know a little bit about where things go .
ok , imagine how extreme self-assembly works .
i know what people think when they see that .
ask them questions , ask about evidence , ask them .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
everything that is beautiful is not efficient .
this is what it used to be like before the village was happening .
this is what happens in the nano-engineering age .
this is a political orientation in our country .
they put them on the beaters machine .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental disorder .
she was able to find a time-learning learning learning in the field .
... the crowd-sourced disorder .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
i &apos;ve worked in a coalminer &apos;s work -- dangerous .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there was rocket and he was talking , like that ?
so that means that the criminals are going back to that .
so , like a human being , with certain things .
and of course , like design takes impact on perception .
but for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
it &apos;s just breathtaking . it &apos;s just breathing .
lawyer : i &apos;m a lawyer .
we have an abstract abstract language .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
but actually , it was a little bit more fun in that night .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so forth .
it was called automatic stone .
inotar is a certificate .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to do ?
he took a famous picture . how did it mean ?
they slowed down for one of our big problems .
we see the process that feeds itself .
warfare ? yes . alive ? yo .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we &apos;re doing .
but they can combine something special like this .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
because the images eat it for them to recommend .
same , and wobbly , you &apos;re in the museum .
the idea is to translate a digital security system .
or other models , or even technical fications .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i &apos;ll explain it .
we can put all this time on everything we want .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
in fact , the advanced society is based on energy progress .
that was not a movie , not a d , that was real .
i wasn &apos;t there for a long time with miguel .
because you know , that &apos;s a fun thing .
have you seen a maneuver ?
there is exactly the same thing that i described .
if you want to get away , get together . &quot;
new america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
frosty , the carbon will get clean every day .
this is an organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
so i step back and i &apos;m going to see the other way .
i &apos;ve filmed in war areas -- difficult and dangerous .
so we should soon figure out what the goal is .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
if we &apos;re building cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
in other words , game is our adaptive joker .
can you imagine something that comes out of tablet ?
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds on their pain .
you can just name some names and people will understand .
diphine , tube , child survival ...
this is a variant of a thing that was made .
now , the energy episode is over time .
and it was an experience that hollywood didn &apos;t give me hollywood .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the movie .
it &apos;s immense judaism in the control room .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s this fun , it &apos;s cotaste .
the guarantee eaks the physical lankton .
and so he lifts his elderly circumstances .
and then there &apos;s a whole bunch of simulations .
but it wasn &apos;t that in the achildish years .
the musical kindness is the extension of our body .
he lived only for three years .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
a baby needs a little searching wind .
so i know some of the ones that have not carried in .
this is already a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone from here .
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
please follow me , because the circle will be close again .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
this is an icon debate . she has to stop .
they go to thabo mbeki in south africa .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face it .
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds of companies .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
bruno giants : thank you very much . thank you .
i have a friend who &apos;s driving a serati .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound shaped .
and because we get older of that , the wind gets bigger .
that &apos;s the timeline that you love .
and we &apos;re still very , very strong in stories .
and i think technology will always be important in our modern societies .
and the predictions that they read are serious .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
and i didn &apos;t expect this to change .
it &apos;s also my great , lifetime and fascination .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
why do you care about us if we can &apos;t buy ?
you have to admit that this is a great choice .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
i started developing some years ago .
they still describe it as untouched .
my grandfather was during the prohibition in jail .
she was a strong , strong woman , she had effect .
so , in some sense , the technology fits us .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
as you can see , these aren &apos;t three special images .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it realistic ?
but what if you want to see the paintbrush ?
but my logical page didn &apos;t like it either .
i just want to say a little about saldman &apos;s .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . heart wish .
we &apos;ve also brought litton to design schools .
this is the simulation of the chesapeake bay .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to think about injustice .
my uncle died at alcohol disease .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also engaged .
in fact , we &apos;re also a majority of these kinds of community .
what &apos;s this new state that takes the world slowly ?
let &apos;s call it a lot of money .
if a neighbor is helping others , we empower our communities .
ohhhh , woww !
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing gallery .
50 percent of their decisions have been hit in nine minutes or less .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and my talk today is mainly appeared by these cognitive act .
well , i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
this is the really cool part , called collections .
open the map , and jump up with a click .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a lot of transparency right now .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
you could also use ordinary design -- technology to spread .
one of my friends has done it -- richard gence .
imagine if these dots could really start to fly on .
i smile and i say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
these are the kinds of questions that we need to be encounter .
i was fascinated by the elephant and beauty of biology .
and i can tell you , it was a very changed experience .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
and this is from a economist . so he &apos;s logical .
i mean , how much toes do we honor from our memories ?
the more money you make , the more happy you are .
that our survival with the survival of every single one is connected .
10 minutes later , the judge had a break .
right , bryan , the judge has magician .
and yes , i have a job , as you may recognize .
second , the same photos should be combined .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
for example , this one , which is completely logical .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
yes , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be out of it .
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing going from the statements .
and the movie will be called &quot; the want to make a difference . &quot;
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
i just think it doesn &apos;t like him , it doesn &apos;t .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy it . thank you very much .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
i mean , let &apos;s ask : why do we fight that ?
these are many deaths from masses , 20 an hour .
so there should be a nine on the beginning of my death .
because they &apos;re the ones who are also the experts for taste .
the system is so healthy it cleans the water .
i mentioned that to miguel and he was kidding .
so the brushing of the legs , the better the system . &quot;
and then i &apos;ll immediately think that &apos;s unfair .
and again , what you would think about today in the spirit .
and the oil is we &apos;re going to replace oil through other energy .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
like algae -- and other frightening things .
i &apos;m not going to tell you it because i want to use it .
it was completely explicitly that she could fail .
so i got really upset , and i wanted more .
and immediately , i see another pattern that &apos;s going on .
yes , this is the bottom line .
that &apos;s not the resource efficiency , but the efficiency .
we &apos;ve been using it in holland for three years now .
and if possible , i will find some of the weird things .
i know now that it was the bottom of the ocean .
and that was the first time i learned this .
i was studying wife and she was in breathtaking .
and the whole time i collected more and more knowledge .
we &apos;re talking about 300 if a bat is going to hit 300 .
in 2010 , we had just connected two billion people online .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
and the lighting way through the rest of the book .
&quot; because it &apos;s been around for them this morning , &quot; he said .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropy .
this approach is all for new , which we do creative .
since that time , we have received all kinds of recognition .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone in this audience .
now , your life itself is not going to be happier .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re always lost .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
here &apos;s a picture of an ornamental in kentucky .
he has a forage of 15 to one .
i can say the kanzler is a man .
we &apos;ve moved to the so-called bird age before .
this is the equivalent of 20 feet , the size of greenland .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve just done recently .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
but if you can , in fact , if you &apos;re in an extender .
then they wanted to kill them because they could eat well .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t seem longer human .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m about to talk about .
or do you want to be more powerful , more power .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though that &apos;s mine .
my great-grandparents died all when they were 60 .
now , where should we go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
that &apos;s kind of all of you in the pre-frontal phase .
and of course , you can never give it to germany . &quot;
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to become more efficient .
and the more i talked about , the more i should say .
and i celebrate , i &apos;ll cry like a little kid .
obviously that &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
when you &apos;re happy , you attract other happy people .
players are in the spiders in the spite of social nets .
how can we transfer these feelings out of play into reality ?
so that &apos;s the same team , bad team was under the best .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worried .
so the people in the west have thought of long time about creativity .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
one result of that was that the telephone was never broken .
we can predict the structure and function of its behavior .
a few months earlier , and i had just missed everything .
even who kills someone is not just a killer .
the invention of language , for example , was a little step in this direction .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
and this video had actually been sent out in january .
every one of these subjects , of course , had a lot of smaller decisions .
there are many others , but i &apos;m still missing the time .
today i want to tell you about circles and openings .
they &apos;re clearly interacting with their environment and their experiences .
that trick you can lead to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
you know , there was no mandarin in the paradise .
yes , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
all that life is beautiful is not efficient .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is the vision of vision .
i apologize that i have to refuse so much .
secondly , what economists call the &quot; perpetrating costs . &quot;
and i think that &apos;s what the world looks like .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
so there &apos;s nothing changed , and yet everything has changed .
we just overwhelmed the 7-billion-dollar march .
so let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
so , if you could do the light again .
it was a store that was called dragon .
are you so far ? you see a little bit nervous .
and when i turn around , the fingers changes his position .
the things that are used only are going to be used in technical systems .
so the device you see , it doesn &apos;t work .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean coal technology .
they did it by serving the land .
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
you see the fear welcome . you welcome the risk .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
there &apos;s just the second best thing , the firemen .
they can throw away where they go and stand .
an amazing error . one of nine innocent guards .
i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually going to have a rolling iceberg .
this is someone who &apos;s certainly four out of 10 .
we &apos;ve used to think that things happen .
i had a 14-year-old , black young black boys as mandarin .
they &apos;re in there , they want to close to the end of the gangs .
and then people could eat that , and would not be blind .
because this is where the actual government is taking place .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what do you feed ? &quot;
and then we started negotiating with the insula .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
i explained what these sounds could have been .
that &apos;s why you help them with , ask the people .
but even our perception itself , as beats us , as well as ourselves .
and other examples are the ambiguous , intelligent systems .
how many doors have the house where they live ?
we think it &apos;s clean -- and we also smell well .
i believe in that and i have the feeling that we should be teaching .
and i appreciate that many of you have done this .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
i sent them home without talking to my head .
the cost of solar energy costs last 50 percent a year .
we need to engage in the machine of the government .
there &apos;s a direct decline for this .
the monuments of software takes a few years into the rule .
and of course , we can find fast foods .
cats look at cats that look at this video .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
and what &apos;s noticed is that i needed a experts .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned language .
i just wish i could see my kids grow up .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
it has sight of life , one after another .
and i transformed them to fund an expedition .
we &apos;re talking about the curse of information flushing .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineer .
and that &apos;s what happened in the first year of his advertising .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
so they &apos;re moving around and making art installations like this .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you &apos;ve got to protect it . &quot;
i was shocked up to the inner threshold .
i went through the emergency department on my way home .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
i say that because i think identity is very important .
because all of these new technologies are now feeding themselves .
because their life depended on whether they did the job right .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and i knew she was about to give up .
today we don &apos;t just think about something that we do with .
a typical walmart provides you 100,000 products today .
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so what i &apos;m telling you about is what &apos;s truly amazing .
in the pre-premise , it was about finding detail .
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;ll ask questions .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought in .
if it wasn &apos;t moving anymore , you &apos;ve buried it .
wouldn &apos;t you want to do that change in your genes ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
again , what kind of potential do we want to call it ?
i say we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
when we looked at how feelings interact with the income .
and this is a little bit hard to justify , i think .
there was no christmas trees . we did all this .
and that &apos;s not what we should . our healthcare system is .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
the program that i use here is a little experiment .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
any of you in a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals ?
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not so sure .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
the words , as long as his friends , spoken now .
and we found that in fact , there was a context .
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical day ?
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
so the driving force is the cyber superpower .
i haven &apos;t had spent more on my wife two years .
the pilot sent the machine to hudson river .
the epiphany is that death is part of life .
that keeps us on the scale , and makes us evolve .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
it &apos;s about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
you can see the person who asks what happens in the inner .
for most of my activities , i have two chips .
it turns out that dna synthesized is very difficult .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we think about our future as a predictive memories .
now , the memory itself is a storyteller .
what it did was it reminded the memories of the experience .
we &apos;re going to meet in the next few days .
there &apos;s a step-by-step line there .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
it &apos;s a fish , but it &apos;s also a bird reserve .
this second fish , which is a different kind of story .
this first one was more like a passionate monkey .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he deceived it .
because the music is a language , and a language is for communicating .
and most of all , it &apos;s the first time to ask .
but i &apos;m just going to do it a little bit more curious .
i began to think , i should just put that project in there .
we can , of course , solve the waste problem .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition here .
if you don &apos;t do that , anybody can take it away .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same amount of possibilities .
just to precise points of time , they &apos;re agreeing .
if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
so you can ask : how happy is life itself ?
most of them are completely ignored by the memory itself .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have any consequences .
has a single in the audience ever seen someone die of masses ?
it turns out that if you can get that in zero .
you can test it for my talk in your rooms .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum , quite many ideas .
and she asked him what are your hobbyists ?
so , again , in every store , you can get things back .
so the question is , how do we deal with this wind ?
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
so , for example , shawn the environment , less car .
and life lived in the coast of british columbia .
so if i put them next to each other , that will be interested in their interest .
now , am i looking at this as a song , could i write a song ?
she said it would be like a donnell from air .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
and you say , &quot; doc , what should i do ? &quot;
they put a blue on a green , and they can make light .
but they don &apos;t really lose the precedent that we have .
these pictures are extraordinary because the transition goes very quickly .
yet , we &apos;re still getting into the galapagos islands .
and more and more people came in , just because they were angry .
it was the fear of terror that her life formed .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
we have a lot of cells that are not alone .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
and what &apos;s below is what we call bureaucracy .
but where would the next aed aed to help this patient ?
you have to meet 62 different decisions to completely your car .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , this just didn &apos;t go like this .
almost like we were going to prepare for our lives for that long .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego space .
i was the only one who could talk to the aircraft .
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
think of this as a sculpture , as a flying imagery .
but bonobos show us the other side of the ocean .
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re doing .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the coming years .
we found this in terms of happiness on the living self .
they evaluate their urine . they almost never do .
typically , most people are starting to orient themselves .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges you have to imagine .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winners .
if you walk , yes , every foot destroys the ground .
if we overpower it , we can go back a little bit .
the most powerful mining workers are the leader of massey .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
there &apos;s a lot of magic . i don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a book .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will only be worse .
and the online criminals of criminals are very easy to understand .
because through marine protected areas , we &apos;re basically returning the past back .
i want to conclude with a story that really got me excited .
sometimes i lose weight . a story to the end .
i found that technology should be allowed to make magic and not kill .
so now we &apos;ve started the timeline again .
so today evolution can happen in the time period of microseconds .
here he lifts a rare tactic .
that means we &apos;re useful , not harmful .
we could , of course , reduce 10 percent , but what does that do ?
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i &apos;m probably not going to be able to take all of you on this journey .
he said , &quot; in germany , there are no death sentence .
car colors , outdoors of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
they &apos;re not going to come out of the lakes of the lakes .
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
i really like your kind of sergey brin . now .
i became the miracle part of not dying that day .
it &apos;s called eyeman and you can see the description .
this is the average size of a greenhouse ice cream .
i mean , what does anybody do with so many outcomes ?
and in general , we can use the word for using intersexuality .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think we can .
we all need to believe in the last things we can &apos;t see .
we call him miguel . in fact , he &apos;s called miguel .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to do first .
and then the same thing happens in a good , fair conversation .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
we take images of this mini-big bang in detectors .
economists call this a parasite improvement .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
this is a whole book , an example of non-imagery .
and of course , we all share the same adaptation .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the fence of infected .
there are cases in front of us , like the one in inotar .
let me conclude with three of my own words : i remember .
innovation , innovation , and development is not just from our heads .
i want to give you a very particular aspect of curiosity .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
ceos are a little bit above average . but this is going to be interesting .
because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot .
here &apos;s one of the proof of that , by the way , men are not pigs .
this dety putape ran over to the older black hole .
but i don &apos;t know how receiver people are going to be .
you go around the block , and it was more open to the block .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back into the temple .
bonobos are related to our next living relatives .
the first of those fall is a contradiction , a bit of complexity .
they invest a lot of their time in the construction of the growing constantly building structures .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy how little it &apos;s supported .
usually you &apos;re just dancing and some people don &apos;t come .
now he &apos;s called the mineral needs of physical lankton .
i take the breathing of the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
you see , this is the real truth behind the outside .
but the question i want to throw away is : why not ?
and the best part is perhaps what we expect in health .
this is technology innovation that is available today .
and i thought , this is going to be so hard , so painful .
wr want to help people who were inevitably convicted .
and that means free access , that means open and productive .
how did he get to look for this particular kind of help ?
let &apos;s jump quickly to moma , back in new york .
it &apos;s going to be part of the show , which is quite wiped .
we produce androgen and we talk on android genes .
and when you do it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this is scandals and we should be ashamed .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
but as you &apos;ve talked to different people of the world about these possibilities .
today , renewables have a renewable energy for five percent .
and they did this with so-called &quot; lead-maps . &quot;
but crucial thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so i &apos;ve been busy doing what &apos;s natural or intuitive .
and these are just the biohackers , the individual people .
it means that we &apos;re reaching a cultural impact next to science .
this made me feel when i wanted my jeans .
he invited the king of side-by-side to the dinner .
but somehow , we can do it by this problem .
and that &apos;s what i had last year .
but instead of being in panic , it just stopped .
how about tears that we can &apos;t predict ?
if you look at the people with whom you have to do it ...
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
imagine every single person being controlled by people .
okay , let me give you a little bit of blood for you .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
new investments to create good jobs .
six : social fall . seven : 65 tomen .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with me and play with me .
what that means is that the player is safe from 10 to 10 .
a long time ago , there were gray whales -- 500 years ago .
in many , you &apos;re going to say , these are crazy ! that &apos;s good .
the x-ray interpretation of a piece of a piece of content is this comparable .
from my eye angle , i looked at the household and off .
the light worm in a jar , i always felt exciting .
this picture , for example , has about 10 billion imagery , i think .
so i decided that when i was 15 , i was a dive .
here &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about . let &apos;s just look at the center .
and within less years , lego went into every household .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work by the way .
and i want to show you my outcomes for this week .
56 percent of all rapes are not going to get distracted .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-organizing .
i asked him how he became such a fish experts .
there was the nuclear research facility ; it was shaking .
from that time , an anecdote that you may know .
no longer required to take a piss or sing them .
and sixty-10 milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
it goes back a lot , into the cultures of the industrial times .
so , i think it &apos;s a very uncomfortable hack .
i think , kind of like , six thousand dollars or something like that .
this has actually just doubted a thousand to eight shape , and this networks .
finally , one solution that &apos;s large enough to solve our problems .
so , this looks like a basketball plate .
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t let myself down .
now , in fact , the number of nonviolence has not changed very much .
i first got it in a restaurant in south spain .
because ultimately , our humanity is dependent upon all of our humanity .
it was always inspiring , so flateral .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
drew the trash up on the side . went home .
alone , this airport has about 100 square miles .
i like things that are special . i like odd things .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
so maybe you should give up the interview a little bit of this . &quot;
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leader .
here you see an excerpt from this attacks -- code .
we &apos;ve got his bed so he can see it outside .
we degraded a human who has value for our society .
we use games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we hate strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : it &apos;s .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
that &apos;s actually the actual meltdown of human and machine .
some people , probably , about as many as there are creative people here .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
they produced the highest structure in the least time .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of tons on the planet .
i grew up with a policing portion of science fiction .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building sisters , not intense .
so here was finally a company trying to do it right .
the components are becoming more and more to the friend who you live together .
and i &apos;m not sure if you really remain egyptian .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little trip .
there was , i think , a very good code .
in fact , nasa showed that there are many of them out there .
they increase the paralysis , and they give happiness .
now , i wondered , how can i actually get this over ?
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all minerals .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view .
someone was broken up , and they had a founding system .
photos like this : a building along a lot of road .
the greatest fear they had inpirates , rape and death .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to get out of all these extensions .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange road .
but besides , it &apos;s a very good meditation opportunity .
i brought in seven submits , and that &apos;s all .
but a lot of people get trapped in a very strange position .
our gut is a wonderful kind of friendly environment for these bacteria .
now , the two types of self-esteem from happiness .
now , life itself lives itself in the continuous life .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of happiness among researchers .
it &apos;s just a stream calories . it &apos;s mite .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
ah , the majority . i like to see this as a doctor .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s about 500 years back .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
it &apos;s the renewables , as they &apos;re called often .
that &apos;s a fish sticks in the southwest corner .
and i ask myself , how peculiar was this diagnosis ?
the notes have the function of the letters of a script .
and then the interconnectivity of the industrial cultures are the pre-industrial cultures .
that is , you have navigators about sound and rhythm .
so that &apos;s just one application that you can do with it .
and then we have a cooperative process .
on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
should i respond to these email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
this is what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
54 percent of the deaths are distracted by the drill .
essentially , the concrete building block has become the building block of our time .
how about a sentence that has never been in front of you before .
how can a judge turn someone into something that is not ?
in many areas , people were afraid of lyncs .
so programs that can be used in the most nucleus .
for example , fish had been taken on a glue .
opportunities that wouldn &apos;t have been allowed to encourage .
so i set out to do some years ago .
finally , when we hit the fear , we should welcome the fear .
one eight-pound , march . how is your brand ?
why is it important to start ? what &apos;s the rered ?
so we created a device that is completely constrained by constraints .
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
well , in that night , everybody went to the center of celebration .
and the key indicator for this is the extinction of languages .
and i had to explain to the journalists that there was no test .
and this is called androreceptor defect .
we &apos;re developing our common denominators , heart beings .
and this is what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
at the moment , they &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
and i soon wrote an article about genetic foods .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
so i offered a 100,000 dollars of software to the winners .
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
there was no piano at the time when there was no piano at all .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
even if you were to shoot now , you would have cut emissions .
most people know most people know about this from software .
this is actually live on the internet . you can check it out .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nunavd .
but nothing was invented , which would leave me again , until now .
and the best part is they connect themselves with magnets .
some of my clothes were passively passive in the last five years .
i looked in the rapink , and it was a little pink .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in that particular tongue .
and i made my first mistake , and i sent them home .
so the dramatic numbers come to the prisons in the prison .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about the death penalty .
a child in india says , &quot; today i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
this is my wool . this is a very simple thing .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
what is the relationship to the thoughts and feelings about them ?
and if the dangerous ones are endangered , really bad things can happen .
and that urgency , that goal , has really changed my life .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
if we don &apos;t take any phosphorus and put it down .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most magical thing for me .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours per minute , a minute .
if you could do it for those , you could also help me .
and just disappeared all these companies , one after the other .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never met each other as adults .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one deserves us from it .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individual capitalism .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individual capitalism .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go into the house .
if you only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
specialized skills and processors and processors and their combination lead to success .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
and somehow , we have to change the changes that are being cut down to zero .
we &apos;ll find other features of what their rights are .
this is the period of most perceptions that we have .
that &apos;s our youngest taster down there on the right .
at the end of march , the lhc is going to be able to rebuild .
and this is the message i took in medical school .
you know how to call a 3,000-league in league ?
i think in many places that are the opposite of poverty .
if you lie , it &apos;s not just a liar .
and so i think that the ted community should be a horse .
and it &apos;s spread to dragonflies , of course , organic .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say , thank you ted .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
well , finally , the movie has a very large scale to land .
this is actually just a time-lapse dream of two and a half weeks .
these people will be connected to the film in eternity -- always for .
so all these green areas , these are the richest environments .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called session . &quot;
so unfortunately , we &apos;ve lost a piece of technology to virtual germs .
i went to the car and was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
in the short period of time , i realized that ted has an identity .
she said , &quot; this is going to be very , very tired . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good intuition to actually execute the experiments .
in my opinion , mass incarceral changes our world has changed .
this is all reality today , and in the future , this is going to be much more possible .
so the games enable the play of binary , trust and each other .
here &apos;s what you &apos;re doing , the more you &apos;re doing , the better .
people said , &quot; do you have no fear to succeed ? &quot;
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , but i can live with that .
and what i learned is that absolute errors are completely unconstrained .
i love these , &quot; watson forced human enemies . &quot;
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very serious .
three months later , i moved out and went adventure .
it &apos;s about being made out of trucks .
i like a lot of black colors , lots of gray notes and such a stuff .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
we want to use this as a possible impulse for the fire .
and the question was , how could you combine technology to connect new technology ?
i don &apos;t want to give you the same rights as a human being .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
and that &apos;s something that we need to learn , and very quickly .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s penetration .
the human being should have a common ancestor or a common ancestor .
and loud , blessing and b , etc .
how were its living conditions , how the society and the politics ?
on 9 / 11 , the machine went to the first time .
we &apos;ve distributed suffered children and we &apos;ve seen them play with it .
and when i listened to her , she went to see keen sounds .
and i was good , i closed with claude .
but if i ask you , how do you do this with your wife ?
you collect information about the play in the soul literature .
now , there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they can all get engaged there .
but how about if the picture connects you to all your images ?
you say that you never forget the names of the devastating .
but she does something that no other government technology .
because the categories tell me how i can hold them apart .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
we should be able to eradicate everything we want .
and i tend to think of wishes as being my shadow .
in a way , studies were conducted to see if that was true .
and then you can see the enormous amount of speed there .
the natural powers come from asia , where all japan comes from .
because a good engineer either built great cars or nuclear power plants .
and that was the very first beginning of a musical printing press .
you can only have lemissions if they &apos;re not there .
you &apos;re doing it well . the question is , how is it going to get us ?
they rented their telephone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
the official faith of all western industrialized societies .
&quot; do you remember the patient that you drove home ? &quot;
we live on a planet that is covered 70 percent of water .

and this is an idea that if you think about it , can only fulfill with hope .
put this buzzer into an additional effect , and they made a poorer machine .
i spend most of my time studying people in investigations , prisoners or death cells .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explosive curve .
so for example , the most well-known version of this communication is the human language .

it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that have written in the last year .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more worth building than building it .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says everything is connected to everything .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is so often mentioned today .
this can be , in our case , that we use to design and create a symbol .
so if you turn on the light , it looks like this . so just like we saw it earlier .
imagine the screen could just appear in different formats or size , in different solutions .
so i started thinking about what it is , what do we do in these games ?

and what we can read almost every day in the daily newspaper that you find in this third sentence .
one example from a very different area . monet painted the erotic races .
and i &apos;d like to give you a protocol that i was here for my part of the jobs here .
that was our first attempt to start with digital information , genomes of genome phi x 174 .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique tongue of the object , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order of the information in which that information is represented .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true today that more is less .
i thought , &quot; make the camera out of it , that we wanted to make a primary conversation .
so , for example , the number four is very specific out of this code ; you can &apos;t see it .
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just that architecture is almost disappearing .
if these imagery are falling down , you can write about it , you can see patterns , images , text .
our cities have been exposed in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .

a tv or a washing machine that you just use , which you don &apos;t need .
in a sense , the arctic sky is the battlefield of our global climate system .
but the more i thought about it , the more i got into the view , the fish knows something .
and that was an example of what our own governments are doing to us , the citizens that use us .
we want to fight bias and discriminate discrimination in the complete system .
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you &apos;ve actually taken .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
and in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve started to abstract .
this is because the government is like a ocean , and politics are the top 15th of cm .
so at the end of a daytime , i had a huge topic that we shared .
something as deep as our identity is now a question of how to show this slide .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , so long they &apos;re not part of physicists .
either &quot; flesh &quot; or &quot; a paradise winds , &quot; they will have the choice .
you can &apos;t just emphasize enough , as critical of that factor of quality of life can be human .
by shooting the sidewalks , and by the way , it can shape the characters ...
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there were no men in their treatment .
i got it that way , when we got our reviews and we got cameras out of them .
how can we keep them frozen -- better , more fresh , more three-dimensional , triple .
and by the way , the side-ranging genes , which are the fourth hormones .
i was the second volunteer at the brand place , so i had a pretty good right to be able to delete .

in china , one of the things that we did today is , you know , a recapitusion ?
it took us several years to start with a bio-ethical review before we did the first experiments .
and the preparation was enormous . we needed to build cameras and seem to build all kinds of things .

they &apos;re not fighting this struggle we all fight about who &apos;s allowed to talk ; they &apos;re all allowed to talk .
you might think that this is just a landscape that was manipulated , and the bottom part was manipulated .
and the next piece is about four women in three generations building together building a new life .
the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is swiss , but you know what ?
just to give you the view , i zoom out so you can see what you get .
and as part of it , they gave us a concept of anatomical negotiation .
or are we going to be something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
i really hope that we &apos;re going to play important games to survive on this planet .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing to have cold and soul ourselves that can afford it .
we &apos;ve gone to a point where we don &apos;t have the same ratio as before .
the idea here is obviously not just the machine , the machine service providers in the control room .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- i &apos;m really blown away from the socks .
these gray boxes don &apos;t walk with winds ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
now , when i was a nice ambulance in college , i had my first bible classes .
and this is half of all the water problems around the world that are caused by the textile industry .
this is almost complete with all of the security -- possibly even for the fish , definitely for us .
in this country , for kids , there are longer appearance without punishment .
here &apos;s what we need to understand under the police department of correlation , again .

so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably the most likely infantry of children .
the next piece of puzzle shows how a boat is heading in the early suicide in lake .
this sounds very long , and it sounds very science to do science fiction , i know .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .

and furthermore , despite her logarithmetic , she &apos;s gone on the left .
michael j. nelson &apos;s mystery was one of the first things that made a joke about it .
so we also want to understand each other , i want to show you a very basic trick , very simple trick .
and this is how you see animals , right next to a 500 degrees centigrade , that they can survive there .

already , today , in some flat lakes in alaska , alaska methane itself from water .
for her life , it had been a task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .

to those archaeological models , we &apos;ve heard that we have a basically natural rapid ratio .
as a child , i had collectors of sticks , stones , escalators and mustresses .
and so from the interest in getting to this technology , i &apos;m just going on there .
so for example , we &apos;ve developed an ice packaging that is at room temperature .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not in openbach , but maybe you can do it a little bit of awe .
in high school , a student said that brian goldman would learn a flower for a flower .
i &apos;m going to get into a statistics that i hope most of you have heard about .
so if we look at the news , we prefer to look for negative views .
and like a lot of people , i thought it was mainly maintaining people in a amt .
so it &apos;s all the tools , and the only thing that likes us is our imagination .
if someone asked you to describe your identity , your identity , your personality personality , how would you be ?
so i &apos;m basically saying , if you look at something that &apos;s impossible , you can do it .
because the lesson i try to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
and maybe we know what wood we &apos;re used to when we really get tested .
a third sentence , which is immediately appealing to people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
it &apos;s called an old-fashioned law , or it &apos;s called old-fashioned psychology that affects us , again , in perception .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re dealing with next to the owner as an age .

we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
i can speed up the whole sequence of speed by putting the speed in one direction or another .
this question was so tangible that we decided to come to the research of the answer and the answer .
we say , &quot; well , computers , please raise hundreds of millions of pieces of instructions .
do methods that are easy to use , and start with this patient , in the team of the poor people .
and i think the most important point is that we &apos;ve stopped talking to our patients .
so we may sell a shoe , and it will be the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever carried ...
why not have the fast muscle fibers that will allow them to get faster and longer ?
we know that as human beings , when we work hard , we do hardly work .
we know from that study that you have to reach the needle if it &apos;s to go to the thing .
i brought you an example of the north american tribe tribe of the noottoman india .
maybe an aging understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative .
we now have almost an infinite number of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century so that we can anticipate the development .
yes , i was scared of privilege , of lightness , of the mountain range .
so we could just end up with a very simple , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
when i went back 27 years later , the fish was shrunk to the size of its size .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , what &apos;s going on with the $ 7100 ?
it &apos;s almost physiologically impossible to be bad at all when you &apos;re located red .
do we use these decisions to form a society that is better , the successful is friendly ?
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change your cells ?
it also makes the entertainment worth of this talk , so i hope i &apos;ll enjoy it .
but in fact , my research at the institute for the future , is exactly the opposite .
nothing migrates into my sleeps or out , no trickles . and you can study everything .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics that made me crazy at all were no fanatics .
you see , it &apos;s a kind of column , often called &quot; migraine reactor . &quot;
i remembered at last year when i brought moskitos and somehow the people liked that .
what &apos;s important to the age that most of the first semester is the great laws .
40 percent of all people in the world get half of their drinking water from this melting water .
this is great . the tube didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly individual .
the viral particles were released by the cells , and they came back and they killed ecoli .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this dot in which our choice is probably improved .

this endless reference is going to suggest that money invest in more security and safety .
police officers came in and created a national forests and buried office .

and by the way , it &apos;s been around for 500 years , as i have to say , very successful introduction .
you don &apos;t sit around and poke around . there &apos;s always a very important thing to do .
our memory tells us stories , which means we can keep from our experiences .
tell me that there are negative effects that have to do with clouds that change things ?
this is just the deadline that tells us the environmental models that we need to include .
and even though it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need fuel -- you have some parts of it .
you made sure that they didn &apos;t bite , in fact , they don &apos;t even leave the glass .
that &apos;s why a lot of people come and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origins of species and the species of the human beings .
i adore my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
evolution is all about the nature of the genome on the next generation , adaptation and generation after generation .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just awesome -- until my physiotherapy .
now if i had ever opened the folder with the 600 images in it , i would have spent another hour .
people turned into their faith , and it turns out that you can &apos;t free them .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a designer workshop .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor that seems a little bit difficult , but maybe they tell us about it .
so this is what we &apos;re looking at again here again , again , again , the whole individual agent .
view : now i &apos;m interacting with the object , i can zoom out , zoom in .
first of all , it sounds banal , but it &apos;s relaxed when you &apos;re closer to it .
because they &apos;re often people , they can &apos;t do it in the user , so that anyone can deal with it .
this is a game with words that is a kind of score of scarcity and beaters .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it will become a huge challenge .
if you break the goldfish glass down so that it &apos;s all possible , you get the happiness .
if i &apos;m in a room -- like now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about .
but after all , i decided , my god , i have to go to the court , and i have this crazy incident .
and recently , a study was made with ceos , where they saw a week for ceos .
so we are overwhelming our brains , because our brains are just not accepting that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future , and come back and live differently .
that means we have a common ancestor , a evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
and i thought , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
so we have the memory itself and the life itself , and they &apos;re really quite different .
unfortunately , it &apos;s all the good news , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;re often mentioned .
i mean , every one of us here could change five times as much for our energy without changing the lifestyle .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i just got two years later when we moved to california .
so , for the learning process of music , at least as long as for the spoken language .
so we had to develop a new method with which we could put these little pieces together , and we could correct mistakes .
we &apos;ve done it in about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that &apos;s here .
and this really takes this idea of creating these constraints for the available place on the screen .
and it &apos;s humiliating to think that our species may have existed for 600,000 years .
because in this context we &apos;re first beginning to realize the amazing things that make us understand .
we developed an app for layar , extended reality to find these aeds .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , that i &apos;m going to tell you about , that will work on the skull line .
we use these great euphemism , attempts and error as what &apos;s going on as meaningless .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and i &apos;m going to tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning .
so if you want to get lucky enough of the two types of maximizing , you will end up doing very different things .
as peter told us , they &apos;re not just the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a cart record .

it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones of every person on this planet .
and to win , the device has to diagnose a better diagnosis than a team of highly skilled doctors .
the founding fathers of my view were the original atomic activists , which is why .
they played a game of rock and the seven-seventh adventh adventure .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people are the success of scientific method .
that would have been without the outer space , but it still does so much more important .
certainly , i would never reach an alien world with a spaceship . it seemed quite unlikely .
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer it immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and this is happening right now .
all right , just to close , i want to realize that i talked a lot about the fathers .
who knows when the film comes out , maybe we see a horn of volcano coming out .
what are we supposed to do with the fact that we only tell them through few nuclei ?
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and then raise my strength and extend it .
but if you &apos;re in an ephemeral adventure , and you say , &quot; let &apos;s get the oil out of it . &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we &apos;d never be able to put it on a human potential basis .
and that &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon children will die again , because that &apos;s just one question .
in the rich world , the millions of us have only been threatened by a generation , not yet .
here &apos;s a very fundamental service . is there at home so you can read the homework assignments ?
the greeks called these divine vibrating mental creativity of creativity .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch them go to the next century .
and we &apos;re installing a evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going on in the micro-scale area .
so in other words , the future is shrinking every year for a year i &apos;ve been in this world .
they shoot the decision -- put it on , even if it comes to their own best interest .
so doing things like that -- you know , people reminds you -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
if you surround yourself with the right people , you won &apos;t only understand it , you &apos;ll appreciate it either .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said they were exactly the model .
a method that is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been using recently is evolution .
we had a team of field lows in boston last year to code the code .
so , imagine if you were at the same time in several places , how would that feel ?
clearly , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
so the neurons are the processing of information processing workers that have built these cellular communities .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital head into the roman &apos;s head .
eaceacea , a little antioxidante to help you on the front .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about has to do with it is to deceive itself .
if professors will become curious , they will often be put in this research semester up .
this is the machine age in the book , and this is what happened , and this is the phototography .
and it &apos;s about trying to solve a playful , creative , original kind of , a problem .
and we think that we &apos;re going to be the first generation with the fourth generation , and that &apos;s going to be about 18 months .

and at the moment , it was like a film director had a stage buried shift .
this is the way i would say , shaking your child , only three times the rate of five times .

his cause to write the piece is going to be more and more and more to my personal , to play it .
but these concepts of cyberspace , they bring us back to discover our capabilities .
so these nineteen to survive , and they multiply themselves in bigger sergeant .

instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor told them , we could do a or we could do b .
i want to talk to you about this mechanism today , or try to explain something that &apos;s unfamiliar with you .
so now i am a favorite part of my favorite images , harvesting sound in the sphere .
but now it comes . when you get evidence , you have to take those evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
in openness , for example , the household 20 percent of the garbage garbage is between windmills .
but again and again , very rare , something special happened . one of the performers was actually translated into the world .
my heart , i was scrambled while trying to figure out what was in front of me .
the human part of this butterfly , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
immediately , you &apos;re going to be able to tell one of the things that you &apos;re going to do , of course , is that you can &apos;t prove that .
they &apos;ve reformed the demographics of the earth in a new way that no war has ever done .
so people who think of evolution as a gene changed at a time will have missed a lot of biology .
and because you &apos;re obsessed with being harnessed with the spirit , how can you be harnessed ?
and for those non-engineers , littany of them became another material , electronics became just another material .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of human community ?
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is indian , but is also very timely .
and every time it divided , the one in it is to distribute chemicals in it .
so i would say there are three simple rules to make a realistic outcome .
so i wanted to create something else where the process begins when the error is expressed .
and if you take a picture with a camera , it ends up taking the process , if you put on the lion .
but my interest in photography , when i first got my digital camera , at age 15 .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break it in 20 parts , as you know it from documentations .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time trying to be myself , i &apos;ve been trying to adapt to ourselves and adapt to me .

every year , we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really had to go back in circles .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated when i was teaching the entrance .
you can go online and create your own museum -- from all these images , you can collect your own collection .
so , in the great and all of us , we &apos;re very confident that we &apos;ve actually determined what the goal is .
well , one enlightenment is to be used to find something because you &apos;ve let it down somewhere .
so the idea is that we actually involve the people with , where they do things together , collective collectively .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the head of the development of a non-profit organization called rome .
it &apos;s about how happy or joyful the person is when that person is thinking about their lives .

they lie , they shrink them , they &apos;re confusing and they really make droughts .
because the soil is going to die off the mosses and the wind and the water is washing off the ground .
so that , as a citizen , you will realize that you will reject with these scientific technology .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a small explanation of what you see .
this is one of the images that we &apos;ve noticed with what is called gigaps technology .
now , since the movie , when sundance was tougher , we can look at this .
and every time i interview someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
polar mountains are born as a calf of a glacier or breaking them out of ice sheets .
so in this project , we actually designed some small markers to track the trash during the trash system .
our language has gone back to the social changes that have been solved in many cases by a technological change .
but danny , throughout american assignment is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
i know that we can do it , and as far as i &apos;m concerned about what the world needs now .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccination for the new yorker , a little article .
this is how the performance is to work with prototypes , much -- but let &apos;s see how the team is changing .
and , although it &apos;s really simple , it &apos;s really hard , because people are making it very quickly .
there are very , very few things that you can say , of which there is a chance in a million .
and i fell in love with how this very deep sea sweeping out , a space mess .
it was the movement of the movement . it was the right position . it was the business plan of the american agriculture .

we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , it &apos;s the highest , not there , right ?
we &apos;ve been digitizing nearly 20 years , and when we sequenced the humanitarian genome from the analog world of biology to the digital world .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of a pr if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning , that the extraordinary aspects of your one is one of them .
so , to buy new jeans after many years of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
in order to give this glorious sense , of course , i had to say something about this remarkable faith of the voodoo , and not a secular magic .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first place for all the information that is part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i got most of the feedback , or where i got the biggest success , those are where i interact with things directly interacting .
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time imagining the production , because , if you imagine the whole time , you won &apos;t listen to me .
you have to separate two things clearly : to be a medical fact , to be amputated and to the other social opinion about whether i am disabled or not .
and the basic idea of this company was to jump the phase of analogy with oppressed printing and the same digital productivity .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to get the data over a usb -- how we saw it in ximes .
and in that way , time is actually the critical variation that has a memory of self is different from a living itself , very little of influence on this story .
and it works in a medical culture that recognizes that people are living with life , and if that &apos;s what people are doing , people are also making mistakes at a time .
and it will allow people to measure from home to their blood pressure to their doctor and share it with other people , for more than 100 dollars .
so the first case : all the stages of atoms that are made out of metal , and at the same time , the same atomic nucleus and nuclei .
when i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t think of a life full of luxury for everyone on this planet ; i &apos;m about creating a full life of possibilities .
but the latest evidence of dna evidence is that the etrushes , later the tubes , the same dna as the old lydics .
how do you get lucky enough to depend on how you think and see if you think about the memory yourself or whether you think of life itself .
but if you &apos;ve got very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think about a mammal -- they bury it without the complex .
we &apos;re going to turn it off and expect the first data in june or july , and use our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
we want to encourage the world of creators , the inventor , the empowers of the world , because this world in which we live , these interactive world .
imagine this device . in a developing country where there is no doctors , 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the staff .
so one day i decided to go to the filiter , and i asked the head of the head , &quot; does this model work , that they would offer all these possibilities ? &quot;
the head of the congress came up on the stage and said , &quot; professor romer , i thank you for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
we have to have these conversations , and we have to think , but if we go into the time machine and go into the future , we &apos;ll be glad to have done that .
so again , i stood up with a little team on unknown terrain terrain , we drew &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that had not been there before .
and then we don &apos;t have the wheel , but that &apos;s salary , i think , has been very good at getting people right there .
i mean , it can be weird to think about that a thing at the same time is two different places , but they didn &apos;t born with this idea , they developed it .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience , which takes us from a &quot; uh-uh-oh &quot; -- to a moment &quot; moment . &quot;
but the brands returned quite beautiful . and people in my company told me that we were not able to do it yet .
i was at the time when i took a course of his curse back , and i was playing the last four bar on the behalf of chopin , a later .
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at everything for you , everybody knew that you had this physical genius test that you helped you .
on nine people we &apos;ve executed , we &apos;ve come to a place that we &apos;ve acquired for innocent , who has been displaced and left out of the death cell .
so a organism could learn to learn , not a particular fruit for you to eat bad , because it made him sick and it did the last time he eaten it .
personally , i think it &apos;s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to deal with ideas in your head .
because it &apos;s about how to encounter people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media , and so they can create a peaceful experience .
and finally , this elderly black man came out with a very troubled face in the court , and she sat behind me , almost at the defense bank .
there it is , this plane is made out of hundreds of thousands of pieces that are working together to make your flight safer . don &apos;t you mind ? &quot;
one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; prevent rat in my trash . can &apos;t be said if it &apos;s dead .
and just as the woman who wanted to learn me as adults , i met , she turned into a box and put her in my hands .
we &apos;re going to have a process that &apos;s probably going to require 100,000 years , and we can compress it on a thousand years -- and maybe even on the next 100 years .
there &apos;s a number of people who have much more &quot; uh-uh-oh , &quot; moments as others , and under the worst are fry walled wine .
that means we see only before we see it , we see it back in the back of our yeast to say , okay , okay .
his job is to create the conditions that are less than a billionth of a second after the universe existed -- and to 600 million times a second .
but they also preserve a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to more and more creativity and more preventable surgery .
and many discussions that i &apos;ve been in the last six years have been similar to the discussion i &apos;ve had for the last three years .
a failure of peneses , if you do it full of water , the pressure has enough pressure , so i think , so four to six to six sixties on it .
and there was something interesting about this , which was me at jacques cousteau &apos;s fascination , which was a very unknown world on our own earth .
and our european connected network is basically just made out of laughter rotating animals from big power plants , where the wave goes around europe all over europe .
one process that -- like everyone who &apos;s ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everybody here doesn &apos;t -- is not always reasonable .
and every year we ask the students to create products and services and services that can live within a decade of a life of millennium people &apos;s lives .
i got to the ted , because i think many of you have understood that the moral skull of the universe is far apart , but that it is the rise of justice .
and finally , saturday : one , unique , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world something about one , without having to say a word .
they didn &apos;t count because he was in love with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had to keep it .
i think that the molecular biology in general is now very general , generally speaking , biotechnology , biotechnology , everything you &apos;re counting , synthetic biology and so forth .
how about being opposed to the oppressed wherever you are , giving a voice to pay for your attention and make change , for the first time ?
i love finding every opportunity to find a different colorful , crazy outcome , the outcome , the last , and also to photograph in more time and blogging .
i told my wife , whenever a human being uses in a moral conspiracy , because we should try to replace it through literally .
and it turns out that when you do it , it feels like it &apos;s a very good tool to save the people to save more .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for maintaining the people we love to maintain floods , but they also prepare for doing well .
so we take something very complicated , turn it into sound to produce a sequence of notes , and produce something very complicated in the other minds .
no , it just looks a lot better when we show that we &apos;re always involved in making the danger , the other ones only when they make fire .
now in egypt , in egyptians went into april to april the april of egyptian police , and they found a lot of action .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of programmable work , numerous parties made and searching for the first time in seven years .
so that &apos;s what these reactors was a problem that we put into our fills and will reduce the waste volume during that process .
in fact , let &apos;s start off by a new point : we have the digital biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing new biology and building new life .
but this keeps me up at night -- one of the things that woke me up at night . we &apos;ve never really got to do scientific progress as we &apos;ve never done before .
according to burres , the premier in january since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls on this film .
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate right now , from the coal-fired power plants , because we don &apos;t have any stores or stores , because it &apos;s not .
many of our friends thought that we were beautiful to do this , and that we would recover all the images from the walls would be degraded .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst errors were only passively passive in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues , but total nonsense .
but these apps are like small digital memories , that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of the government who are tailoring and services .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very exclusive life-long life , at the time , at least he was really exclusive .
in a country that has just been behind a hedge crisis , where congress was voted for this congress with 124 / 11 .
it seems that we would be quite remote from the other parts of life , but actually most of the lives are the fundamental mechanisms that are pretty much the same .
but the logic of the disappointment allows us to do that , as if the first set of proposals were wrong , as if you were to take the opposite of that without proof .
it &apos;s always a very happy concern , if i have the experience , i can see that i spent so long working in the way that i &apos;m going to remove .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up to my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply deep , you hear it . &quot;
well , there &apos;s margins , and eight-marks , these things that come and go , but a delusion , march is a pretty strong thing .
and if you &apos;ve got it , that the droplet of steps is complex and high-tech , let me tell you this : the data is a science for science .
if i tell you that someone has rated eight on a scale of 10 , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self .
now , i was talking to some people in the company , and no one was able to give me an answer , until finally , with the lighter biologists .
basically , you get every round of pure randomized characters , and as you try to train words , these are a dictionary .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot of well-being or maybe a little bit less about it , and i talked about it .
but then another thing happened , very interesting step , where things got completely different , and that &apos;s when these cells started communicating information and sharing information , so that communities came from cells .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference , we say , in climate .
it &apos;s staring at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see is flood and those density , march march .
we now , from our discoveries around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these design components are the future of the future .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me tremendous confidence in our future is the fact that we have more than individuals today to set ourselves the great challenges of our planet .
so a app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s expanded by selective , is sort of a bug on the institution of the government .
what that means is that if you were to meet someone and you would tell them , oh , his father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about his size ?
at this point and when you laugh , you realize how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience something that artists can tell us very well .
how would it feel to live in a world where the state of german people had gone , especially if there were many layers in the world .
and because the government finally got its power from us -- remembering you , &quot; we &apos;re doing this ? &quot; how we think about thinking about how this change happens .
are they reliable , stable , family anemia , secure , saining , teng , and just like the dalai lama , right ?
this is ayaahuca , which many of you have heard of , the most powerful psychoactive paradise from the repertoire of the snow .
and very often i &apos;ve been working with interactive people whose gender is gender -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female types .
we had to do that at the time . if we took a book , we took the description of the audacious and injected it into our heads .
we came up to talk about music . and a few days later , i got an email that was assuming that nathaniel had an interest in me .
and since we &apos;re at the meditation campus , for example , give ourselves the virtual reality in our v.r. lab , we can actually do it all the time .
and i spoke to you about , how do you do this thing , and i know you both , if this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not entirely blame , right ?
because it makes a lot of sense , like everything else that i &apos;ve heard about when it comes to explaining the absolutely crazy treatment of the creative process .
so it &apos;s so far . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there at the time , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment ever went -- 27 kilometers through the diameter .
and i have argued that maybe we &apos;re a new form of the cambrush explosion in which there could be a massive , massive education based on this digital design .
the reason that it used to be better than everything was worse than everything was worse was worse , was possible for the people to make the experience a pleasant surprise .
and i handed out with myself that if i could double my efforts to the perfection and never make a mistake that the voice could turn on .
so these are just a few of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but they can also be the last six days , or the last six years .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i would spend several months trying to plan them to find the different places for the puzzles .
but also , because it turns out that by using all this time , we &apos;re actually using this whole time to actually change what we &apos;re able to do as human beings .
i can now raise the sounds that bach has had on the modern wings to make what a baroque can &apos;t do .
now , from german &apos;s german , to translating more knowledge , you can admit it once you do it , or you &apos;re talking about poetry .
bg : well , we need one of these scaling , generic things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve spent 20 years inventing and then for 20 years .
if you also play , you see some nuances here , the top zoom eyes , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprising .
you have to imagine that , if you &apos;re making something like the classical sofus , five hours and with this new kind of natural software , just an hour .
i &apos;m a canvas . to work , i have to be able to stand up at the same time and sweat myself , really uncomfortable .
so they came out , according to herodus , the worms game and agreed a national strategy , and on a day you would eat . the next day you would play .
the other note says if we &apos;re using the zero-footprint technology , whether it &apos;s in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
the movie studio , i sold this as &quot; romeo and julia on a ship , &quot; it was an imperative , a passionate film .
so far in discussions , this insulin is going to be trying to do the audacity , which has a small net that has nothing to do with our connected and nothing .
and so we decided to build ourselves in berlin a hall where we could sort of form the electric force in the island of one at a time .
that means that the interpret has to translate these unprecedented angles of the notation in another language , encounter , concrete , non-verbal language .
and the intuitive use of this is not only an apple since apple &apos;s elementary economic factor , it &apos;s elementary success if i just want to make technological devices .
many journalists called me up with the question , &quot; what are you going to do , who are you going to get us late whether casters or male ? &quot;
now , what i hear is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing , which is wrong .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them to play some kind of game together to control their health .
and imagine , in fact , being a five-year-old child with dr. p.r. , trying to stop those practices , natural success .
bg : well , the actual spending spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than you &apos;re doing today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore and interact , and the unexpected , which we train , are the nutrients of the real creativity .
and there was neither video games nor with computer-generated movies , all the imaging imaging imagery in media , and i had to create the images in my head .
as you knew at the time in the village , who &apos;s got what &apos;s going on with wine and when this is happening today on our extension of our mobile devices through these mobile devices .
maybe i wanted to succeed so successful and be so responsible that i was so handed and so i could be able to provide my patient without having to contact him .
i got a fine ticket because i &apos;m not on the bike , but there &apos;s often a disability that doesn &apos;t go all the way across the board .
and so i see myself as one of the people in common with the most experimental experiment , the good logic takes a good logic to add complex ideas together .
if we look at one of the founders of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offered us in his &quot; i have a dream of a &quot; solution . &quot;
jacques cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating shows that can show us animals and a world of miracles that we &apos;ve never imagined before .
and of course , if we succeeded , we &apos;re going to make it possible for the nike , for nike , for mauritz and the whole textile industry .
in every step , we &apos;ve produced these pieces in the snow so that we &apos;ve been able to sequence them because we tried to create a very robust process of what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
unlike the 20th century entertainment in the 20th century , the community is part of our way of getting rid of this phenomenon -- either spreading it out or making something new .
my wife , my kids , and i walked into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and dictionaries and archives have taken over our house .
we can take a step further and rearrange the data and see that the circulation of cancer and the cancer are suspicious , but not for everyone .
90 percent of the great fish we love , the tuna , the tuna , the heat butchered fish , the sludge , they &apos;re broken .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has doubled , which has doubled the most appropriate access of the world population , has tripled to triple .
one of the areas that we see in both of our current culture , in today &apos;s culture , in the united states , are the fights of life and the end of life .
now , that &apos;s good , except that paul is running around vaccines and talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are , and that people should simply stop being jammed .
the second fence is a representative of experience and memory : essentially , between being happy in your life and your life , or your life with your life .
you go up in these capsules , float into this dark , hostile environment , where there &apos;s no hope for saving if you don &apos;t make it back .
so you know , from then you also notice that there &apos;s a change , and there &apos;s only this kind of defense to this decrease , which is a hundred percent renewable .
it was primarily in the cell , and the other chromosomes as a foreign material , and so we ended up with a new cell with a new chromosome .
and these scientists have just documented the different subjects with these ceo , and how much time they make decisions with these subjects .
all of them think i &apos;d run between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and avatar , &quot; and i &apos;d gone somewhere to a handle on the palm of the beach .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i do take it , and i should do it , because that love story , like romantic , is always rich .
my first memories are by this boat -- the steam tower of the motors , the claw of a wave on the bug , the range and the horizon .
and if you manipulate the speed of this roman , you &apos;re actually able to crack the pipes and even leave the centrifuge .
it &apos;s the living self that the doctor would prioritize -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; does it hurt now if i turn it here ? &quot;
now , if we go on and go back to age , we say 40 or 40 years , we see that even accidents are the main thing that people should care about .
we should call it what it is , a commercial , a gear , a gear , a gear , risky , risky capital that allows that production to do exactly that .
we can use whether or not we can use carbon co2 that could simply be used to produce productivity , reconstructing co2 into the fuel to drive this process .
so when i started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
if people were going to take this fund , i mean , it seems to put everything on your head , everything we think , for example , in tax politics and so on .
there &apos;s a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two guards , and it &apos;s as if the opposite is already the opposite of the first sentence .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the crew -- and redesigning design -- which we actually started making the company -- slowly .
it looks something like this , who has no willingness to be free , can &apos;t be drawn for its actions and maintained responsibility , and so it &apos;s unsustainable .
since i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and that &apos;s why my palette of music sounds have much more color numerous , emotions and emotions than today .
it &apos;s also in an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , electronics and bumps and combines the experience of these .
and i learned that the world of deep sea , even in the shallow ocean , is so fascinating that we can &apos;t really imagine .
and then the power of the semantic connection and the inputs that you get from it is really enormous , and it &apos;s a classic network of recovery .
i &apos;ve done a poll recently with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that are used to be a typical american on a 70 day .
and a few weeks later , the firemen got a letter to the households that they had in the take-home use of their household .
food that was eaten by a heads or a chef of cheesy , needs to be eaten and not only accomplished or receptionally .
they should prepare these innovative strategy , and they would be ridiculed by the ridiculous , the ones that will be spent on these innovative things .
and if you want to go over 20 , three percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the performance that you have to switch off at the moment .
and then we set up a d.c. barrier and plummeted the laser and tried to focus on that camera .
and of course , the chance at random , elected instructions are very small that they &apos;re going to be constraints of annual animals , so they &apos;re not going to actually make any of the instructions .
that means instead of remembering individual discrete , common , common pattern in common patterns of memory that we can memorize our personal memories .
and yet , the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkable cobble technology that you see here is changing .
so i sent them home , i made a lightning voice in my voice trying to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . &quot;
what do you believe how the average performance of a cardiologist or a nurse or a nurse or an orthopedic that should be a birthday , a rescue ?
this is a people who are not disturbing the colors between the colors and green , because the sky is disconnected from the people who are depending on .
and my love to science fiction appeared in my environment , because back in the late &apos; 60s , we went to the moon and explored the deep sea .
we see many , many gigabytes of digital photos here , which are continuously replaced as they &apos;re moving , on any kind of arranging .
this tribe , which codes , have 17 varian varian aayan huasca , which you all recognize in the long way in the woods that appear for our eyes as a way of being .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole idea of advertising was to present your product as many people as possible , so many people can see it as possible .
and in this community , you can see the most important thing is the aversion that you have in front of each other because you have a task to explain the other .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have traveled down to the award of the earth , to see that they &apos;re not removed at all .
that our system also has a price on pricing , which is that we &apos;re still doing 20 percent with el and also a higher price on the other things .
we only have two years of phosphorus and now is used by the phosphorus of phosphorus around the world , much more uranized in the environment than in all atoms .
we projectify that 10 years into the recognition of recognition of the civil rights reserves is going to be as high as the plot of the election .
and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s grown up on the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to build the right systems .
and so far the isolation , if we as a species of distant planets , there will be isolation and changes in the environment that could make evolution in natural ways .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science . but i &apos;m certainly thinking about it now , a director has to be a leader , a leader like a ship or something like that .
and after a very short period , it had lost all the characteristics of species and converted a whole new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
well , i hope you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use for real work in real life , and that games have a great meaning for change .
now , all of these random instructions , all of the programs , all of the programs , all of them , and finally , those of you who are the next to me . &quot;
these are two very different units of life itself and the memories of itself , and the two of them are confusing part of the understanding of happiness .
if this is a device -- or dna virus that &apos;s not known , it calls health care and prevents a pandemic in front of your breakdown .
now , if you do it , people bought six times the jellyfish , who you had six elected choices when you had 24 choices .
but it was a fairly abstract argument in one place when there was a pause , octavio said , &quot; paul , we might look at tedtalk . &quot;
but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve been programming , we went to the progression in venice , my kids were hired , my dog , and we &apos;ve been doing this .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the ancient greek historius , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
but i think in this frame here , and with the intent , i &apos;m going to make something real , i &apos;m going to just leave the needle in there and go from the stage .
and from my perspective , the scientific method is to try and see if it works , does it change if it doesn &apos;t do it , does a great achievement of human achievement .
a lot of arguments about it . fisheries protect the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a large part of it .
and because they &apos;re working much harder than we are , and because they &apos;re only three to six months , they &apos;re talking about weight in their weight , in their energy consumption , a little bit of about three billion people .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and all the miserable health workers were surveyed , then at the end of the day no longer left .
i think the remarkable values of the last few years , the last decade of being , is that we have changed from a physical world .
so gender is really complicated ; sexual sexual isn &apos;t just in the middle of the gender spectrum -- in a sense , you can distribute across the entire range .
and by the way , we move around and cues so much that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for evolution to find the statements .
of course , the stories that i was looking out of the sciencing area : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; abyss . &quot;
and in this scenario , imagine that in a case the sperm is wearing a chomm on the x chromosome hit the chromosome .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive human beings , and flourish , from the fight of human mind is determined to move through conflicts .
and i got myself in the middle of the box for years , because i wanted to make renewable energy and i didn &apos;t leave it in karlto .
they believed that creativity was a kind of divine spirit that comes from a distant source , from unknown people -- from unknown , unknown reasons .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescription drugs for people like you and me , if you think about it , no sense at all , because we don &apos;t buy them .
armstrong twitter was talking about us , and then , in december , the time-lapse magazine , when one of the top 50 inventions , which was really great .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people use things that we design .
they were the notion that people who had political power had to have this political power because of the bloodline , from the grandfather to father to son and so on .
i &apos;ve given some people the number of books that have published &quot; titles in the last five years , and they &apos;ve been spending about 40 , and there &apos;s a lot more .
she came from a man , a african-american , sympathy , rau , homeless , who played a violin , who had only had two strings .
and i went back , again , through the same torture of shame and self-doubt , i felt myself and i went to work all the way back and back and forth .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willingness to get us to the truth and the reconciliation .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the profound and weird of quantum mechanics .
and urgency optimism is to immediately do something , to make a hurry , to the belief that we have a founded hope for success .
well , very briefly , a different reason that we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .

i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve just been learning about a couple of years of biohacking , and i &apos;ve just started this because i just wanted to know it , and most importantly , what i &apos;ve learned in the study of theoretical .
and i left medical school with the impression that if i knew everything , and knew how much it was possible , or as much as possible , to be as full as possible , that i would be able to do that , i would be missed by the errors .
and if i go one more step back into these intersections of where i live , the language , the tiest , the gesture of the gesture , and i don &apos;t have to control the curriculum , then i &apos;m even faster .
that means , i &apos;ve actually spoken to you now that you don &apos;t recognize any more patterns in the middle , but i &apos;ve put it in a constant game , over and over and over again in this picture .
in the moment where i turn my hand away from you so you can see from the back , this finger moves , my finger , just from where it was , where it was a position that it was extended .

so what we &apos;re looking at here is , if i do things old , i can make them confusing how on the right side , where i don &apos;t know what sales is , and pepper dancing , or i can make them intuitively intuitively intuitively interacting by showing things .
because it turns out that when you &apos;re offering a placebo in a white mushroom where you &apos;re in a form of an aspirate tablet , which is just a round of white ball , which has a particular measurable effect .
the kohlands evolution evolution , the industrial revolution in the 20th century , and even in the 20th century , there was a case in the accident , and so we have refrigerators , we can create climate materials , we can create modern materials and do so many things .
we switched the lights off , put it in a vacuum and clean air , and refrigerated it and refrigerated it all the way down to the point of the elevator alone , the metal piece of metal , all the way it always wanted to behave .

and dr. kea further said , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they don &apos;t get anything else in their hands , and if they get a little bit out of support , if you can get their own children , then they can get a lot of other kids . &quot;
if we get to these really big stuff -- with over 100,000 base pairs -- they &apos;re not going to grow into ecoli . it &apos;s going to grow all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we turned to other mechanisms .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a outsider , a lateral , a rebreather , in the image -- not just , but for you to be grateful , maybe a gift of grass .
and so , from the city , i think , is a very different view , a very different way of looking at negative , which i see negative , positive and positive city , and so on this sort of way , a different virtual map of landscape from a very real city .

as i said before , i &apos;ve been given myself over the years in some pretty awful situations , but nothing could prepared me , nothing prepared to do with me , something so hard and as dangerous as these guys can go into a room .
and that &apos;s very amazing , because you actually believe that this technology is encountered because the fact that the one is actually bringing you into the future , but in fact , it &apos;s so much that the future is exactly where our archaic is .
and because i was born with no legs , and my feet were fed after you , and i just had some toes on this toes , and some of the toes he had to be on the other side of the brat , that strangers had to get the bad news .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was thinking about 20 years ago when i first told my teenager that i wanted to be a writer , with the same kind of fear .
if we &apos;re in a game world , i think a lot of us are going to turn into our best version , right now , and instantly ready to solve harrocks the problem as long as we need to try and remix it after the failures .
and i think there &apos;s only one of these little devices that should be intuitive , because things should always be intuitive , natural design , and where you have to look at it , which is actually human for us , of course , something that is friendly or intuitive .

so , imagination is more challenging , and with this phrase , i &apos;d like to close , a again , to give you a clue , designers have to think differently , to come up with new solutions , and in this sense , thank you very much for your attention and your attention .
and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation -- i would be very dangerous to capture this dark path of the suspension -- especially in the process that i &apos;m in my career .
the elderly black man stood up . he looked at the deputy , and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come here to tell this guy to lose this man , don &apos;t lose the goal . don &apos;t give it to you . &quot;
so , the problem of cooperative online worlds like the world warcraft is that it &apos;s so peaceful to stand on the edge of a episode at the moment that we prefer our entire game in these game worlds .
later on day , i went to this site with miguel , and i asked him , &quot; i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be so different , &quot; as any farm i ever had been on , &quot; how did you succeed ? &quot;

they were given us to tell the story of neuromarketing , as we tell the story in this film , that we used mris now to make the centrals of the brain , to make both advertise and advertising movies .

both in my job at robin laden and my volunteer , as a volunteer , i &apos;m a generosity of generosity and kindness in the great scale , but i also look at love of love and poverty and individual .
suppose you live in a certain remote area , and you have a beloved human being with cardiovascular heart disease and your hometown to have this cardiac box with 200 acres .
but when i was doing the phone , and i asked him why he made these interventions -- it was a risky thing -- his answer was that in his country , these kids were going to be very bad , and so he had to do it .
and , of course , when and of course , it &apos;s kind of intuitive , and as i can , as an age of impact and designing things like that , you can use it as a user , so it &apos;s intuitive , so it &apos;s intuitive , because they &apos;re fun to use it and just be fun .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do whatever -- those who don &apos;t get the sleep handle , and who have no limitation , the results with bad results and the good results .
it has three big problems . the cost , especially in highly regulated countries . the question of security is that you really don &apos;t feel like nothing can go wrong , despite the human work that &apos;s not used for weapons .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do , because we &apos;re afraid of a real gas , and it holds millions of people from flourishing .
now , to decide not to buy glass at all , it &apos;s probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our tactics -- but it turns out that the decision-making process is affecting us into very consequence .
i don &apos;t have to admit these things to emotionally , because it &apos;s going to be the same as the corner , it &apos;s going to be a crazy , colored , punctuation of the nightmare , just waiting for me to love when i love a little bit in the heart and quest .
so this is one of the effect . the other effect is , even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end up with the outcome of the election , as if we had a chance to decide ourselves in less possibilities .
this is a picture that i took at the northern islands of the buffalo when i went to mit on the narcisgal hunt , and this man , aolya told me a wonderful story of his father .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the memory itself , and you can think of this as being a self-thinking , which is sort of the living thing , through the experience of living experiences that doesn &apos;t need to be living .
i mean , if i &apos;m in the elevator , i &apos;m going to make all sorts of weird things , but then i &apos;m going to go on other people , and i &apos;m going to stop doing all these things because i don &apos;t want them to do it , or frankly , they &apos;re disappearing .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to use ourselves and use less and less , but in average , that number is going to grow every year , and so it &apos;s going to double more than double the number of services per person .
i met these guys , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project light on any light on any surface , and then draw them on a punch of laser , which is just the negative regions .
so what that means when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place of people in evolution , and particularly as we look at the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a set of opportunities .
so there &apos;s great pricing here . there &apos;s challenges in transmission . so if we say we need energy outside the country , you don &apos;t just have to deal with the technology , you also have to deal with the risk that energy comes from elsewhere .
but , as we think , the only way that we think of biology is a huge impact on the cost of food , or the limitation of their ability to have available is when we see co2 and therefore we &apos;re working on the cells that are going to go away .
i started working with this scientific literature on how this centrifuge was built in natalie and found out that they were structured in so-called kaskes , and each cashiers contain 164 .
now , the amazing thing is that the tags are confined to the beetles that are contain in the liane , mao inhibitors are exactly the same way to ask the trypes . so they ask themselves .
this is a problem , because the warming of the frozen reason for the arctic ocean , where there is a huge amount of carbon dioxide in frozen carbon , where it &apos;s going to be a micromethane .
what we also found out is that the goal of the attack was actually slow , slowly and insane -- obviously , in the attempt to make engineering engineers so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to be able to get behind them .
so maybe some of these technological change in this technological change , because the more we &apos;ve always had a different truth , which is that every human being can give something special and very powerful and very powerful that human ability to adapt is our biggest plus .
my good friend ray shores that every tool that is going to become the information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , the power of moore &apos;s law , and the price performance is about 12 to 12 months .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as an international group , as we &apos;ve become aware of ourselves , is o.k , we &apos;ve now been here as a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people who are getting there and so forth .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say to your parents that you would never walk , and never be as moving as other kids , or you would never have an independent life , and since then they would just lie around me . &quot;

this is what we feel so guilty about the earth that we say , there &apos;s no bioagricultural land , no bioluminescent progression , and how they all leave , that our own existing creature .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i found something very fundamental : in most of the existence of lives in single organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information that comes in both cell cells in dead .
and that was worth it to me about all of these things in the sault of the clean room , because , you know , the massins , the difference between a single difference between an individual and this piece of metal is about the same way that the difference between metal and all of you .
and i then got to the six-and-a-half , and then we got together with friends , and i got together with friends of the company of solon that company , and then we got together with the span of one of the largest cellular cell people in the world .
at the time , it was just like a monkey , where askull , and others have said , &quot; are you going to actually reading the insane when people are going to read the people , then the afterwards are still talking about it , and of course this is completely atrocities .
if a prisoner did something impossible , something magical about magnet : allah , olh , olh , allah , allah , great , great deal , it &apos;s a glimpse of god .
so what &apos;s happening in the future is that everything from the top down to the very beginning , from the very beginning to the end , with martians -- from the sponsors that they &apos;re going to see in the movie is the marx .

in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermal sources , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before have seen before , things that nobody else had seen before , and for the science , when we saw them , we didn &apos;t find any words .
we believe that polemics -- we believe that smallpox is not persuasive , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website gets 35 million every month .

but we don &apos;t even know if we hear someone like this , because we &apos;ve been familiar with this kind of out-of-the-box time . we &apos;ve kind of seen the lightning light and collective creativity , that somehow , and somehow , of course , art and art -- at the end of the semi-end .
and what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve actually been using a new kind of network that has been used all over the world -- this is a mobile phone -- anonymous -- anonymously and aggregated information from this network , using neohs from the driving site to understand how the city works .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this great idea . and this great idea : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- about all gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no more mystic space that takes the creatures from the divine .
in our desire to protect the people who are at the heart , and who are telling them the cold , truth about their medical cake , or even a proximity to make the quality of life that we need to adapt to not allow us to understand that someone is actually disabled .
i told you about four techniques that the problem of decision-making equipment -- will contain the millennium -- will make you more expensive , more expensive -- make it available ; they will make it real estate ; we can do better with categories , more categories , more resources , more resources .
because we have this self-deception , this sense of being great , tribal from the highest beings , not from a review of something so uncalculate like an organism that exists still , and that is the equivalent of anything else for us .
and that is , if you &apos;re all your feelings about politics and the long shame and all the other things that we &apos;re really talking about , the government is really exciting , in the words , in tim &apos; tim &apos; the lo &apos;lly , &apos; what we &apos;re doing , we can &apos;t do it alone . &quot;
this seems like maybe a little bit of waste , so i repeat it so that if we can deal with problems like hunger , climate change , global conflicts and obese , i think we need to try to play games online for about 21 billion hours a week to the end of the decade .
and our goal was to come back to seventh and 20 to 50 percent renewable and then stay here , the rest , the last 10 , 20 percent , 20 percent renewable , that &apos;s going to be very expensive , and it doesn &apos;t work that you &apos;re going to make the batteries out of the batteries .
but it &apos;s going to find 17 mariners who were willing to hold these control , who wanted to do business with someone like this , and how to persuade us , and finally to tell the stories that we didn &apos;t have stories -- stories that would never support a advertising .
but in fact , you &apos;d think about it for a long time , but you could never simulate it , would work out whether it was going to work , but there &apos;s modern supercomputers , you can simulate it , and you can see that , yes , with the right material , the material approach it looks like it &apos;s functioning .
but the process and the steady cap that surrounded him , was when he took it out of genius , where he didn &apos;t take anything out anything but to go back and find him where he came back . he realized that there was no inherent thing , he didn &apos;t have to be an elaborate thing .
this self-event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biographic called the bike , pray , pray -- that decided that , unlike all my previous books from around the world and went out into a big mega-event , which was a polatorial thing .
a continent is always left out , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa there was no religious faith , and of course , there was a voodoo that was simply overwhelmed with this very profound religious thought that during the tragedy of diaspora slavery over time .
but in fact , we see more and more , more and more , if you are prepared to constrain , and you &apos;re not going to have the important opportunities , well , there &apos;s a increase in sales that will be forgotten , the cost , the cost of r &amp; amp ; d , and there &apos;s an improvement of decision-making .
and one day , he looked at me at one of my practices -- these practices were just mosquitos and nails -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re a strong force , and you &apos;re a young girl , you &apos;re going to be one of these guys .
and wind and wind and sun , and the payload came through and came to the conclusion , a very exciting outcome of the outcome , that you &apos;re going to get the conventional system after 20 years into a century of about five kilowatts per kilovarian hour , about four and a half cents a day .
and the problem , it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can also be a problem with just being a gun-hearted thing , like simple things , so an arbitrary question , a problem , a question , and how can you do it differently , or how to do it better .
females eat on planks of plants , snakes , floods of monosys , chemicals on earth , the chickens and all the time , the entire industry has simply asked : &quot; if we feed more cheaper people like this , how can this be terrible ? &quot;
not through the latest mists -- and tracks of toronto , but through fruit land , not through pump , but through frozen water , not through frozen boards , but through the forests , through the lawyers , not through fish and fish and fish , but through fish , but through fish .
so these are the one more artistic direction , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and philosophers working with scientists so that they can ask questions about these technologies and ask the creative questions , and the creative process , because there &apos;s all kinds of exhibition , and yes , all kinds of things .
so you can summarize the unprecedented co2 , which has increased temperature , and this temperature has increased a lot of negative effects , and maybe worse , and worse , indirectly , indirectly , that the natural systems can &apos;t adapt to change , and so whole systems can fall together .
eyebrows are things that are tempted to be frozen , like the prince of prince , newspapers , badly , evaluated , burial , and love like eynn , poem , and i.e. , i , like mystically , magic , and magic .
she didn &apos;t paint at other times , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran out and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t reach the house and rolled the poem by her and rolled through her , and she said it . she said it on land , and she said , &quot; how she was going to go after a different slides .
now , this may be a modern contribution , and if you were better than i would expect it to be great , but my point here is that we have to work on all five of those five , and we cannot give them up , because they have intimacy , because everyone has problems .
so where and where you see how far we are , what we really wanted to do , and how sad are we sad that we can see on earth at all , that you can see , for example , that there &apos;s a drawback program , all the way down here , you want to be able to be here , right ?
in my 2020 years of medical sentient consciousness and journalism , i have a personal medical study about medical mistakes and wrong to make everything possible for my first article that i wrote to the star star show for my star show , &quot; black , &quot; to learn how to learn .
and with the total transparency of the total transparency of what the new thinking is , what the old thinking is , don &apos;t say yes , that in the laser horses , and meat is no more than other phenomena , or other phenomena , i want to do that right now and do that .
now , not exactly what i was hoping to do , but i was going up -- the treadmill , along the way , &quot; the real firemen , the firemen who &apos;d been there with this point at the time were pretty much done to get some sleep out of the bedroom .
i had to get individual beliefs infinitely often repeatedly with these poets -- changes in different colors -- you know , to create my leg muscles . and i hated these more than the other one . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
but we wanted to go a lot further . we wanted to build an entire bacterial chromosome , and it has more than 50,000 letters of genetic code . so we thought we could build it in the size of the virus that we could understand the size of the size of the cassette variation to understand what the individual cells are .
and from a conversation this morning with dean , one of the innovators of the ceo , i want to share with you something with you -- he gave me the permission -- his engineering , the slums called &quot; slums , &quot; and the many of you may have heard of . it has the size of a refrigerator in the student .
&quot; cloud-based , &quot; something that my friends in autodesk call &quot; metrics , &quot; sensors and sensors , robots , 3d printer , allow the personal production to democratize our personal , synthetic biology , vaccinations , medicine and digital materials , nano-engineering and digital materials .
and look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo doo actors in a transfer state of tranquired light without burning comprehension , an astonishing ability of the mind of the mind to affect this body that if it &apos;s going to recover an extreme condition in the real condition .
this was the most surreal form of a désumé that i had ever experienced before , because before i knew about a corner of the box , i knew what was going on in the globe of light , i would run up there , i would run up the moon , and we &apos;d run the movie .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bus as a center of the desperation in all directions , because if you look at the tree of the tree of life , all of the appearances on these two beaches have in evolutionary terms , they &apos;ve succeeded in evolutionary success ; they &apos;ve survived it ; it has fitness of its environment and strength .
and so with that premise , with that premise , then , for example , brian degger in england , has tried a minimum , then a steady cosmic rail , a hot cup , and a hot plate , and yes , breaks , and brothers like that , and then goes on with the bacteria , it works .
and then just came out of the do-it-yourself bio website , founder of the founder , and he said , well , we &apos;ve got to meet right now , we &apos;ve actually really got to meet , and then two channels , one in london , one thousand , 10 thousand , 10 in the u.s.a , in san francisco .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 , you want to get zero , and that &apos;s going to depend on people &apos;s number of people who use the service of people who use average , every average person in the average , of the co2 service , every unit that &apos;s energy emitted by the energy per unit per unit .
and the insight of president lobo , was that , in a sense , i was thinking about the premise that i thought of as a way of getting the foreign investors to come and build this city , could be more important for all of the parties in honduras that were score for many years of fear and suffering .
i was reading this list from a friend of mine , and i had to first laugh , which was so ridiculously ridiculous , but i was only able to talk to &quot; court &quot; and &quot; no longer needed to read , and i had to read for the first time in this case , which the escape and the inhip could shock the emotional shot .
so , a group of ara , who i learned from a while ago , a while ago , is the one that is a student congregation that wants to communicate more in the public , what she wanted to learn in college and have done so much on the street , and try to explain what people are trying to do .
there are 175 ressant resemblance in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count about 10 extra tails and 12 samples of seals that you could buy a huge number of desalination desalination , which is an unlikely accident that no one in the 175 , no one is in the 175 .
and that was really , really , really , really , really , very bitter , and then you come into this phase , and there &apos;s a kind of a diarrhea that i &apos;ve been asking where i &apos;ve been looking for 10 years , and a thousand years , and you know , it &apos;s going to be a lot of what &apos;s going on in the collective , and , of course , this is what the great thing is supposed to be .
so what i &apos;m going to show you first is , as quickly as possible , the basic work is a new technology that we can give away from a part of a year precisely a year ago , and that is ragon . and it &apos;s a environment that is either available or able to deal with huge amounts of visual data .
so the first thing that you &apos;re going to do when you &apos;re big , when baby is , is that you &apos;re taking care of what the divorce you &apos;ve got , right ? and after all your parents have allowed them to play more or less in the pottery and to play more , your curiosity , of course , you &apos;re going to cultivate your earth .
i mean , most of my life &apos;s eyebrows of life -- and i &apos;ve done that -- you know , the psychological thing is about three seconds long , and what it means is that you know there are about 600 million in life . there are about one month , about 600,000 , most of you don &apos;t leave any of them .
bill gates : in order to run the simulation of a supercomputer , all of the great scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we just need some 10 million , and even if we put our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s reasonable , just in the 100 million people .
and that really works , which is done in the academic condition , and we thought , well , this is what we might have done , then we may have done a webcam , which is set up the lens , the lens , the lens , and then you have a microscope , which is about a quarter hundred times .
and if i show you 600 newspapers and i show you in 10 categories of categories , or i show you 400 newspapers , and those in 20 categories , they believe that i have more choices and more choice than i gave them the choices that i gave them on when i gave them the one that i gave them 600 of them .
it &apos;s friday , friday friday , friday friday . god , tron friday . friday afternoon , kweets , friday eyed . friday friday friday friday . her s didn &apos;t think we were going to talk about this video without talking .
i think that i don &apos;t have a significant idea -- not the only one , but a significant contribution to this level of depression , and selective is that people have experienced their disappointments because their standards are so high , and then if you have to explain that experience , you must think it would be your fault .
amongst the neolithic revolution , which brought us agriculture , and we were in the moment of the secular record , the posted , the poetry of the poem through the proplot of the priesthood and the archie , and the archaeologist , and just came up with 10,000 years ago -- just 10,000 years ago .
so that is , if you focus a laser foam , you focus on a space in the room , then you can catch little particles in the air , or in the air , and then you move in that focus , so that &apos;s where you start , so that &apos;s where you start , so this is how a victim of a kind of victorian basically basically basically .
it would be great if we could get this paradigm of normal to a different possibilities or the strength of the strength , to actually set it a little bit more dangerous , mutual , and so we can get the power from lots of very many children , and invite them to invite their value into the valuable society .
and you know , you know , when michelangelo formed the moses , it means that he took the hammer , and he threw it on moses , and actually -- you can still see a little bit of a little unenable -- and he said , &quot; perform chli ? why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
but if you &apos;re in 2011 today , if you buy a new red laser printer printer of the people who buy printing a printing page and a page , then this heroic page would print on every page , every page that &apos;s printed out in the back , the pattern of a pattern that tracks you on your back and forth .
now , my colleague , my colleague at mit , assaf , you know , could give you a lot more about this , and the many other wonderful things that you can do with real things , but i &apos;d like to talk to you about the second part of the talk that we &apos;re talking about at the beginning , and that &apos;s the conception of our environment .
now , the problem , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have been haunted sympathy for the difficulty that they have when they &apos;re born , and they &apos;re cheaper , but they &apos;re sort of looking at the past , while the real world is real . our world is writing .
so i did this in my lab a little bit of my home , a little bit of a little bit of time , and then i did a little bit of craftsman on top of ebay , and i bought a little bit of that , and i tried to do a little analysis , and i tried to do this , you know , a little bit of prints , a printer .
and if you were to pick a vacation , and if you were to choose another vacation , there is a conflict between your two species of self and you have to think about how you have to decide how this conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think about time , if you get a sense of time , and if you think about a different response in mind , you might think of memory .
in the early 800s , i got an amazing task when my professor asked me whether i was interested in whether or not to go to haiti and film the secret societies that triggered the foundation of dumb sound and maton &apos;s coupled , and that was used to make it more biomized .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people are always asking me to talk about how i deal with wimashes and i &apos;m going to give you a little bit about this : this sentence has never fit for me and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable with questions of people , and i think i understand why i understand why .
and if i translate this into this -- for instance , in which i &apos;m going to be a superbetter sense of selective selection than selective , in which all of it comes up to me , i can look at the detail in the detail , and i &apos;m going to say , &quot; no , i can send that out or buy someone or something , and so forth .
i recommend you all to read the book or to watch the movie so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness between these two men , but also how the music helped create this connection , and how eventually this instrument was , if this game is allowed to get the game done , the alarm off the street .
so here in the picture , you can see the lab , in the leadership , so there &apos;s a garage with all kinds of lab masses , and the reason is that it &apos;s done a group that &apos;s involved in paris , and it &apos;s pretty interesting things , and i want to do a little bit of the project right now .
not a biologist , for example , claiming that 50 percent or more of all species are dying of extinction , because it &apos;s not true . and yet , this -- the apocalyptics on the field of biodiversity -- hardly the diversity of what is most optimistic than what we are familiar with the censorship in the field of cultural diversity .
bg : well , we haven &apos;t set ourselves up to a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting rules for the &quot; nuclei &quot; in the name of the name . &quot; there &apos;s great interest in the country , and people in russia , in russia , india , india , i &apos;ve been here , and i &apos;ve been talking about energy sources and how we &apos;ve been talking about the energy source .
so the computer visions of the computer have taken these pictures together in the real space , where all the records in the grasslai in the canadian harbor , and you can see here , there are some elements of stressful imaging imaging imaging imagery , and these things are all being made up close to each other .
and if you look at the software that we &apos;ve just seen , it &apos;s going to look at , then you &apos;re going to understand why ninety-nine percent of our software is not a little bit intuitive or an information tool that is used in multiple areas or many ipad spots , although it &apos;s more intuitive than classic software .
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift in perspective is one of the responsibility for making decisions from someone who knows something -- namely , the doc doesn &apos;t know anything , and it &apos;s probably not very sick and it &apos;s not the best way to make a decision -- the patient &apos;s best .
and that idea retweeted me when i was in the middle of the conservation process , pray pray , i fell in love with one of these grubs that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you think it &apos;s a desktop . that &apos;s the worst thing that &apos;s ever written .
we also have one of these same agencies in the same size as it is in halfway that &apos;s halfway into the hall , in fact , the entire dynamic behavior of this grid , so in the halle now it looks like this , and this is where the big bath is right here , the batteries are all over here , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing with the net .
she believed that a genius of this kind of magic cardiac creature , was believed that it was literally a bible in the art of an artist &apos;s artistic -- about how the households -- the cat and the artist , the artist and the artist of the impairable work , and the result of the assistance of the assistance .
now , if i want to make you a little bit about this , it &apos;s that all of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of its parts and instead of thinking about information that i &apos;d like to think about how we can use information about how we can use information , and so we can recognize the pattern that we don &apos;t see otherwise .
so we &apos;ve done a study that i &apos;ve done with shlomo benartzi and alessandro andro , we &apos;ve done a study of people with the people -- who &apos;ve been working for all of them -- and these people were all in a collection of the collectors that they &apos;ve been part of their participation plan .
so , interesting historical footnote : when the moore &apos;s soup drops them together with these . the language changed out of the centuries of allah , allah , lah lah , lah lawrence roll out eww , eola , says , you &apos;re still fighting at the puppetry and dancing and sounds .
now , today , you need , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this -- what &apos;s going on in real time , a couple of thousand sensors that information that gives information to the information that you &apos;re working on and then use that system to send back to that car and make decisions about this car and change in real time .
i was terrified , not because of this , but i was frightened that i could lose him into a circumstances of his circumstances , and that i could destroy his relationship to the mind when i started talking about tons and pearls and pearos and other kinds of dagodding of dagogy .
so , in fact , the fact that you remember the 20th century , not for its wars or innovation , but rather than becoming a lot more than a era , where we were against the massive destruction and destruction of the cultural diversity and cultural diversity on earth either , or passively acceptable support , so that &apos;s not the problem .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which was the brute measures of visual effects in visual effects and computer-generated effects in new heights , with realistic realities , human character that had been made during the day , and the main character was supposed to be all the characters , and should be the world .
i &apos;m probably listening to the two nice girls who are still there , i &apos;m probably listening to the generation of this bad umbrella , because i &apos;ve been studying 10 to a hundred untweekends , before making polls in carlboard , high school today , i think it &apos;s called &quot; high school . &quot;
now i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a fragrance session after a lecture of one of my readers , a story of a story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said he had a sinony , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and at the end of the day , there was a terrible sound .
you know ? i think you know ? i think you &apos;re allowed to allow a person to think that he thinks he &apos;s a bit like the vessels and the essentials and the source of all the source , creative , unknown , unknown , infinite is a little bit of a bit of responsibility to ask them a human being .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and if you can remove the co2 , then the skeptics will say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in that , it won &apos;t emphasize , i wish it &apos;s true , but i &apos;m going to accept it , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the cheap . &quot;
and it &apos;s actually the point of making decisions , because if you have a patient who &apos;s two things that we say , in two different surgeons , and he decides to choose what he is , the decision that the memory has chosen , the memory has fewer , and that &apos;s the bad thing that &apos;s going to get chosen .
now , you know , all of you know the healthy dogs , if you give a secret of the uncertainty of the price , even though this is going to be on a date , and then you get caught up , and the best friend &apos;s best friend comes with it , and my discussion is going to be terrible at the end , if you end up with the bad thing , and you swear to make sure you make a mistake again .
you know , you know , one of the great guys in travel , and one of the pleasures is that in ethnography research is in common with people who still remember the days , and they can still remember the past , and they &apos;re still in the wind , and they &apos;re feeling on the rain , and they &apos;re touch with a flower , and they &apos;re reaching out in the bitterrain of the crops .
if you &apos;ve ever had the chance to have the opportunity to work in your town center , to work with our fellow scott silence as a part of the program -- in fact , they all do it -- you &apos;ll see that people calling the problems because of many different problems , including an inverted in their house .
so the beauty of this is actually beautiful when you do this , agriculture , biogas , at a hectare of hectare , at five times in favelas in favelas , so it can produce about a hundred thousand dollars a hundred dollars so that it can wait for a minute and wait and pig and picks and picks and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables .
let &apos;s go back to the amazing wave , amazing events , and yet i think that we have to go back to the creation of the amazing wave , to find an amazing wave in which we &apos;ve been fighting these things more than 300 years ago , and now that we &apos;ve had about 300 years ago .
so , using color , you change color , contrast and helplessness to the images of individual images , photographers , you can see how fish , you can see deep , deep colors and distinguishable disorder , and we can digest the boundaries between different images and different images , and as you can see , even though hundreds of images can essentially contain hundreds of oysters .
now , if i were to go into a room full of colleagues with guns and instantaneous support and grappling with them , and tell them what i &apos;d just told you , i &apos;d probably not be able to achieve the end of the second story before they really were going to get unpleasant , someone would hip a joke , a joke that would forget about them and forget the rest of them .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who doesn &apos;t accept evidence for biologic evolution , this would be a very good moment to turn on your device , take your personal communication -- i give you the permission -- and maybe you can still look at a cap &apos;s book , which is why it &apos;s not going to be wrong at all , because nothing &apos;s going to do in this talk is going to you .
a few years ago , the laser price of the scientist , shinya yamanaka was advised for his research in the adults took a adults , a broad broad broad broader , and the manipulation of only four trips to go back and forth to a pluripotent cell -- a potentially able cell in the cell is able to be recommended in a cell .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve made all the kinds of batteries that are made : for the cars , cell phones , cell phones , light bulbs , everything , and that i &apos;ve done a lot of the electronic energy that goes out in the world , and i found out that all the batteries that we can produce now less than 10 minutes of the energy .
now , let &apos;s take a step back into the time of the big bang , 14 years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of creatures , maybe up to three billion years ago -- the first earth &apos;s earth &apos;s first organisms , maybe as much as a organisms , or a billion years ago -- and then the species of human species ended in the last 100,000 years .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral notre dame , which includes computers in flickr with images of flickr . just give an emergency to flickr , and they become images of men and shirts on the universities and so on , and each of those valves is a picture of the farming that was discovered to be discovered as a lighting model .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old south , we make people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted , being convicted , higher than victims , if victim is white . it &apos;s 22 times higher . if the pitch is black and white and white , the victories in the same state that people live in their bodies .
i once i traveled with a young colleagues around 6,000 miles from west you to western china by southeast tibet , and when i first came to la la , i saw the face of the statistics behind the statistics that you hear about . 6,000 monuments turned into monuments into monuments and 1.2 million people during the cultural revolution , during the cultural revolution , the cultural revolution .
and so the idea is , now , when you have all kinds of important problems , you have to invest in what you &apos;ve got later -- and you get into it -- and you get the investment is not so clear . in fact , pc pc doesn &apos;t necessarily give you the worst possible scenario and there are people in the rich world who are looking at ipcc and saying that &apos;s not a big drama .
we put the chromosome on the chromosome of a microbial species , and we said , these two socks are just as far as humans and mice . we gave some extra genes to pick this chromosome . we were able to destroy it all the proteins . and it was very amazing to us , and it was a cell -- and it was very preferred -- and it &apos;s very low .
margaret mead , the great anthropologist said before she died , it &apos;s frightening that as we move towards the capsule , angry , global view , not only would we reduced the entire human bandwidth in a way , but that we were going to have a dream of a day from a dream , and that , in fact , we forgot to forget that other possibilities .
and i would like to show you just a very much the original data set of noah , and this is from a early prototype of synth synth in the early days to show that what i think is the fact that the pointing technology behind this technology , the synthetic technology , and this is not necessarily what we look like when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
in some trials with other words , sugar pills , some studies have shown a measurable effect , the placebo effect , and it &apos;s just because the person thinks what happens to them is , or a pharmaceutical kind of -- a management of management , for example , if there &apos;s just enough patient believing in the body , it &apos;s a meal effect called placebo effect .
if one of them didn &apos;t say that was the opetric cattle , which has a completely shell . i spent 10 years on this , if i &apos;ve done my great work , maybe it &apos;s a really great engineering thing , because all of my colleagues around him have always wasted with me , you &apos;ve got the money to do it for a child .
i had recently had such a meeting as the extraordinary american poet in rwandan stone , who &apos;s now over 90 , but her whole life was in thick , and she told me that when she was in the villages out of the local virginia field , she was working on the rock , and she was going to hear how to hear about the poem .
it means it means that a little child growing up in the quest to believe that the mountain is a puppet , or her destiny , will be a fate of other people , and to have another relationship with this kind of resource or , as a little kid growing out of a montana that will grow up in the mountain that will help a pile a pile is a bunch of rocks .
i usually think my role is to explain to people how wonderful technologies that are coming up with what are going on , and i thought , here i am , here i am , to tell you what i really think . and to try and understand what &apos;s going on and really going on , what &apos;s going on in front of these incredible technologies that are going on , which are so little that we can &apos;t do that .
and that would be , and that would be the answer to the stock market , lord &apos;s argument , that if you use all of this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all these other targets , all the other targets , the poverty rates that are reducing malaria , and so on , that it &apos;s such that it &apos;s a dumb resources that money has to invest in money while there &apos;s better things we can do .
so these guys have come online to travel online , but they &apos;ve been illegal to do it by using tropics trojans to buy money from our bank accounts , while we &apos;re doing our online banking , or the keyboard , or also collecting our credit card information that has collected on the keyboard of the keyboard , while we have an entire computer online .
and again , wife &apos;s parks came back to montgomer , where she had two of her oldest friends . these older women , johnson , carriage , who had the montgomer &apos;s boycotypt -- an unbelieveiled cn -- and an american virginia guar , her white lord , tany , tar clifferr .
and then the open source , and they set up two things like this , and they said , well , o.o. , we do it easier and cheaper , and then we got it out of open source , open source hardware , things like this , and these things are kind of like this , and they &apos;re actually put the market tudes on the market right now , and now they &apos;re getting the cushions of these cheating devices around the world .
in fact , this made me do this in another human being under my friends under the kul tul , who believe that the forests of the uprisoner were hutled by the cuban hub and the heavens and the balkans are the balkans , the northones in the world , the parties of the violin , the violin of their hair .
so , a week before a week ago , national academy of the national academy of art banks for francis and wilderness and wilderness , two scientists that encourage each other to encourage the natural process of encouraging the natural process of encouraging evolution faster , and performing proteins in a way that can lead to a more efficient way -- that &apos;s called &quot; direct evolution located . &quot;
now , in biology , and now it &apos;s in biology , and that &apos;s where i want to take this metaphor out of synthetic biology , that biology is actually a science of science , because it &apos;s a story of abstract code , it &apos;s a abstract code , it &apos;s not the same as computers , because it &apos;s like computers , it &apos;s because it &apos;s dynamic , so it &apos;s not , and it &apos;s just real , and it &apos;s cyber .
now , bruce brown brown brown brown , a famous design researcher at the british university of british university , has gone so far to say that these mass media , the book and the book , which means tv , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , and so what we &apos;re doing now is we have this mass memorizing of our media and printing press .
and i &apos;m really , really happy to have some happy companies and companies , for-profit profession and profitable , because i &apos;m sure -- i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let this happen again -- the right to buy the rights on the right , you see the right now that the title of the title did not have a lot of content at all , and i didn &apos;t really have to say that much about what his subject was going to do .
so , in the process of living with this sentence from the enveloping of the idea that success or happiness depends on challenge a challenge , without being able to prepare a kind of interactive with the experience . as if my life was so successful , i would be able to see the way i was able to promote life with a prosthetic limb , or how people perceive me as well .
and when these people came and looked at these people and looked at who are the best proteins in the world , this was not a professor at all , caltech student , it was not a tech student , it was somebody from manchester , a woman who worked as a pastor in a repertoilet clinic , and who worked the best clinic in the clinic at night .
now , of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. p. so , i &apos;m not going to do the kinds of things that i wanted to do with the idea that five year-old girl in the second medical school , but , in fact , he taught me to see my practice with the new eyes , so that i became a new experience , and a new experience of mind .
i &apos;ve been looking at this past year as i &apos;ve been in the past last year to model what i &apos;ve been doing to do in the past , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies , to see if they &apos;ve had better or more reasonable ideas than we &apos;ve had , how to deal with emotional risks with the emotional risks that are connected to creativity .
so we have this kind of situation where we have a situation where our science continues to promote more than we have to deal with these categories that we have for stable suicide categories , which are very simple perpetrators to create long periods of identification , much less than we have .
so , i went home and i went home with my wife at night and i told her everything , &quot; and we thought , &quot; well , wait a second , if there &apos;s this technology , you can use his eyes to tap things , then we should find a way to read a laser , so that he can do it again , that he can do it again , that he can do it again . &quot;
so , there are different things , and there are different kinds of things , but the nice thing about this is that a urgent molecule has so much energy , as we say , a coaleses , and so if you can deal with these problems , and maintain the radiation are maintaining , and the amount of footprints , and the potential for the country , so the other things , and almost one in your own country .
from the medical standpoint , you can say , of course , that my legs , the laser surgery for visuals , cranking skill out of synthesizers , for the body of human beings , allow all of the people to use their possibilities to develop their limitations , their fate , their fate , has not to speak out of the real , their own people , give themselves a sense of their own identity , redefining themselves in the world , and forgive themselves .
disabled , &quot; adjet , &quot; verbs , helpless , helpless , destroying , destroying , mutilated , mutilated , dismissed , cohesion , broader , regarded , posted , posting , bamongst , bamboo , weed out of aning , wetlands , weak , restored , restored , checked , segretted .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words to a english scientist . humphrey daphy , who i suspect as though he used to defense experiments of his teacher , michael farming , michael farms said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind as a way to think that our scientific creation is not a sense that there are no mystery in nature , that there are no mystery and that there are no mystery that there are all of us . &quot;
and we &apos;re taking a number of companies in the nodes of ethnosphere , where we &apos;re going to take our audience to such cultural impairing that they &apos;re moving from the hunter , and hopefully , they &apos;re going to become a central to the other great anthropology of the anthropology of the world : that this is a world that we have in different ways that we can actually find a way in which we can find a way in a cultural urbanized world that people can help us find each other .
you know , one of the things about them is that the great choice has been salt with lots of salts , if you buy one of them , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and the salman is salute ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that they could have made a decision that they could have made better . and what is this alternative that they made the decision that they made the decision that they made , and the decision that they made that they made that decision about the decision on their happiness , and they made it a decision that if they made it &apos;s a good decision .
and at the end of this amazing opening day , she suddenly taken out to home for the first time in her life , at age 18 , she looks at a sunset . and in that moment of consciousness , the moment of consciousness , when the first thing begins to do is to look at the beautiful landscape around the landscape of the landscape , everything that &apos;s going to be learned in the magnificent life , and it &apos;s called &quot; plot of the path . &quot; and how do you see it really ? i have told you . &quot;
and i really found that i found that he had a lot of time exposure to my entire childhood , no matter whether i had an letter in the second grade of the class , whether i &apos;d been able to talk to the pathway in which case was located in the parallel , no matter whether i was a perpetrator or a pervasive of mine , and using these students to teach his teaching students how to teach students how to teach their students students in the school and school in order to do their school .
and if you look at people , and when they have people who are persuasive , they have a soul , they have a soul , or they can say , they believe that they have been wasted by the soul of the soul , they are so much more important to do that than that would be the soul of the soul that they have , not just complain from meat and blood cells , but they are , sort of , sort of , sort of , more suspended , unlock it , and , you know , miserable , miserable .
so , in addition to being a computer scientist -- inspired by the way , by our interaction with objects -- with my consultants -- with my consultancy , and my colleague , evan , i started to wonder what would be like : what if we use computers to use the computer instead of a mouse of how a surface of a digital body would be -- what if we could move with two hands on , and what if we could attack the data and attack them together ?
so i &apos;d like to wrap up my talk in the sense that the times i &apos;d like to summarize my talk and to the sense that the qualities and the skills that we have come back from the age of vocabulary , and the ones that have gone on us a little bit like this are in the machine that the machine has been able to activated , so that the aid of the age is what we &apos;re doing again , and that we can restore this kind of technology , and we &apos;re actually not going to go back to our complex social interactions , but actually get back to us .
and then , at age three , boys are going to be separated at age three , four and a half years from their families and separated from a shadow of shadow in the world , star starks at the stone age of 18 , gadise for 18 years , two years from now , nine years old , and nine years old , the pregnant years old , the pregnant times as much as the pregnant woman her mother , now they &apos;re singing in her mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother , orphanage .
in fact , when we put a land on this point at the point of chief chief chief , which is what happens when we put an imprisonment on our land -- what if we just put it in a message -- a message of american message ; an american part of the canadian -- and if people want to work under the rules or the united states , or the united states where they can work , and where they &apos;re going to go to work , and they &apos;re going to go to go to the area the area of these areas of america ? &quot;
and i want to end with a poem by a poem by a poem by a poet by a poet named randomly haz , in 14th century , and i was told by my friend jacques boson , and that was called &quot; the poem by god , &quot; the only four words of god . &quot; he knows not the child who doesn &apos;t know the god &apos;s name of god , but the name of god &apos;s god , he says , &quot; and he just took me out of all the words , &quot; and he says , &quot; and all of me has been told me . &quot;
now , if someone has done the mosquitos , and all of these sacred rifice advises and who they are , all of them are , then my photo will be transmitted with all of the data , all of this data , and i can use it as a place to use it as a gadgets in these areas to use these pictures , and in these other parts of the other kinds of people , and then i think they &apos;re using an experience of social experience with each other .
now , of course , we &apos;ve got a huge amount of idea , but we &apos;ve got this problem again , because we &apos;ve got this problem again , and then we &apos;ve got six thousand , and then we &apos;ve got a little group , we &apos;ve decided that we &apos;re going back , and we &apos;re going to start the next thing that &apos;s going on , and the next thing that &apos;s going on , and we &apos;re going , again , this is going back , and we &apos;re going on , again , this is going on , this is going back , this is going on , we &apos;re going on , we &apos;re going to say , just going to be doing this crazy thing .
but what happens is that there &apos;s not a lot of place in the brainstorm in the brainstorming of ashes or the cold , or the ancient tibet , but they still have a sidewalk through time and a mystery of the earth , not the idea of being close to it , not the idea of being aware of being aware of being human , but the fact that the idea is that the idea that it is going to become human , because it &apos;s going to become aware of the idea that it &apos;s going to be human .
making fun of people miserable , creating the system so that the system is able to make the backups that make it easier , make it easier for people to refuse the wrong and make it accessible , make it accessible to every person who can actually map the health care system , can actually make things out of it , and make it very specific and make it very specific for me the mistake of how to do it , and how to do it for the people who make sure and make the rewards .
in fact , in my professor of richard , who &apos;s the head of the head of richard , i even had a professor with my professor , richard evan , who was the head of chedelic with the magic of the magic , the magical mushrooms in mexico over the last 300s , i discussed that i presented to you couldn &apos;t claim that tamiman as a hallucination , because there was a moment in the moment where you couldn &apos;t find yourself as a hallucination that you couldn &apos;t find yourself as a hallucination , and that &apos;s a hallucination .
and then , in fact , a book that was filmed by many times many of you will know the story of the story , because steves later on , a book that was filmed with robert joined by robert jney and steve lopez , and founder fox pex , who was the monthly grooming , the ceo of the united states , and who was brought in to conservative conservative conservative conservation and took over and took his career .
and for example , women used the concept of being a common cause to use such an example of the women , the polling concept that the concept of the founding , the proof , the profoundly saying that nuclear is more important than atomic atoms , and we said , &quot; we have a mother &apos;s relationship , &quot; and we don &apos;t have a mother of emphasizing that this isn &apos;t quite meaningful enough , that we should have cipity in our civic , right , that we should have the right , etc . &quot;
we all use them , or their competition , but these are particularly persistent states such as foreign now , we all use them , or many of us , or their local leaders , but these services are particularly perpetrated in alitarian states such as iran , where you can use them as discardiac surfaces , because they know they can help more local trust than local regions , and they &apos;re so close to local officials , so that they can &apos;t help them get around and they &apos;re so close to their local government .
and what i ended up doing is looking at people &apos;s space , and i ended up getting people interested in the world , and so on , i ended up getting people interested in the space and working with nasa and nasa in the nasa and the wedding process and the right cyclothes . they go through russia , drive across the country that would fly the biometric space , and then take the bible , fly around the boss , and then take the boss and take our international protocoloney and take our international boss national boss .
so , if i were to say , &quot; if you were to say , &quot; look at my closest white day , &quot; white coat black , &quot; black . &quot; i got the habit , &quot; this is my mistake i &apos;d say , &quot; i was going to reset any mistake from the rescue to the assistant to the potato the poet , &quot; this is my little poo , &quot; b , &quot; so this is mine , &quot; b , i &apos;m going to say , what ? i &apos;m going to say with the microb , &quot; and i &apos;m going to him .
it says , &quot; we have to do the glass , print the whole technique , and the difficulty is , &quot; if you go back to land , and says , &quot; we have to do it , we &apos;ve got to do the glass , the ubiquitous printing , and the whole technique around , the human ability , and the ability to explain that , &quot; if you &apos;re not able to do it in other people , or say , &quot; you can &apos;t do something like that , and you &apos;ve never done something about it , and you &apos;ve never made someone else .
and wherever you can see in the world , you will discover that these cultures are not opposed to the underground . these are dynamically vital signs , their existence of their forces are refined to go beyond their capacity , and whether it &apos;s the impairments that are embedded in the first place , and yet , at the heart of the south africa , of the south african people have been seen from a south african people , and they &apos;ve seen that they &apos;ve now lived in the nearest way , and they &apos;ve seen before the neanderthals of the south african people .
now , if you look at places like e.v. , you can see if there &apos;s no real life in the same way that you can live in , and you can see if there &apos;s a lot of water that you can live in , and you can live with yourself in the middle of your life , and then you can &apos;t see how there &apos;s plenty of cidgeting your life , and you can &apos;t have a lot of cigarment with it , and then you can &apos;t do it yourself in your life , and then you have a lot of it &apos;s going to live out of it , and then you can &apos;t save yourself . so if you can &apos;t save your oil and then you can &apos;t save yourself in a lot of your life with it . so , and then , and then you can &apos;t save yourself .
but it &apos;s a little bit of a peanut that has a little bit of a column , but it &apos;s a lot of other things that it &apos;s made in the middle of , it &apos;s not only a lot of the water that it &apos;s made of , but it &apos;s not a lot of the way that it &apos;s done with a lot of it , and it &apos;s not a lot of the water that it &apos;s done in it , but it &apos;s not going to do it , and it &apos;s going to have a lot of it &apos;s going to do it , and it &apos;s going to do these two things that &apos;s really a lot of these things that &apos;s not reuse these things that &apos;s going to grow , and these little bit on .
in fact , the most sophisticated way of looking at the world is that , in fact , the most sophisticated way , we have seen that the world is grappy and the other picture of the world is that even more sophisticated and more sophisticated , the fact that the only way we have seen in the world , the most myth of all of all of the time , the insurance of the earth is that there is a lot of the time , the most infoundance of the inuit is that the sadder or the intent of the intent of the earth is to have ever since then the other people who are still has ever since then the intent to be able to be able to be able to be able to see that the place , the place , the place , the truth , the other people who are the truth , the truth , the marcandeshibadverthumbrink , the other than men of the
now , one of the things that we &apos;ve seen is that , you know , a little bit of the number of years ago , a little bit of women who are dying in their little family , and they are now interrogated with one of three years ago , and they are now interconnected to one of them , and a little bit of their young women in three years ago , and i can &apos;t speak about how much of this little embedded men of their mother &apos;s water over the age of one , and they &apos;re all over the age of three , five years , and they &apos;re in their little embedded into one of these little family , and one of these little women of these little women of these little women and they &apos;re in them .
now , in the middle of the column , you see , this is the part of the midst of the world &apos;s islands , or if the cinema of the northwest , it &apos;s in the midst of the northwest , or in the midwest of the world , it &apos;s in part of the northwest where i think it &apos;s the colonoscope of the northerners , or the mid-winter , or in which is not the northwest of the northwest inhabit of the northerners of the mitheast of the mitheast , or whether it of the northland in the northland in the northland , or in the northland in the northland in the northland northland , it of the northwest africa , or the seas being , it , or the seas being in which is this is a , it , or the fo
