thank you .
seattle ...
i don &apos;t know .
because that &apos;s singing .
but it &apos;s about it .
don &apos;t find .
yes , hello .
we love innovation .
solar technology is ...
that &apos;s not ...
we were poor .
are these all ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
after a week .
great trick ?
that &apos;s what we were .
a few less .
and he says ...
we know that .
ta-board !
wait twice .
here it is .
that &apos;s going fast .
they need time .
music as language .
that &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... not yet .
thank you .
what a fish .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
that &apos;s efficient .
wonderful , right ?
completely inefficient .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much .
hence .
the only chance .
not a hospital .
thank you very much .
stephen watts .
three out of 10 .
that was incredible .
thank you . thank you .
yeah , sort of .
it &apos;s terrible .
long , yes .
fantastic , right ?
the sun goes to the sun .
oh my god .
we love entertainment .
we pick up .
where do we go home ?
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we lose them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
a lot of things .
sounds good ?
the whole environmental discussion .
sounds familiar , what ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
that &apos;s great .
that was fascinating .
can i be honest ?
the farm is incredible .
what did they do ?
robert gupta .
this is the system .
this is what &apos;s going on .
yes , good day .
lento , slowly .
that &apos;s all i &apos;m interested in .
we can do that .
what do you say ?
not very sustainable .
yes , milliseconds .
that &apos;s our present .
they have similar principles .
yes , good day .
good work ! yes !
just do your job .
this was the result .
thank you very much .
and she did it .
so they meet al .
it &apos;s essential .
they &apos;re all important .
very different term .
it &apos;s incredibly exciting .
that &apos;s me .
it &apos;s bathroom .
yes , that &apos;s going .
flying cat .
this is the last .
can we change it ?
these days are over .
these people make money .
what happened here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
rent them again .
and that &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know .
centers were built .
what happened here ?
but you know what ?
what was the result ?
i was amazed .
it &apos;s generic .
so they knew everything .
you could see manhattan .
here &apos;s the video .
it has sensors .
why no longer live ?
he opens the door .
a few more .
that &apos;s very good .
oh , so the one .
there &apos;s no normal .
yeah , i know .
pretty good , not ?
but you know what ?
i have a question .
okay . thank you .
i stood up with him .
players don &apos;t sit around .
so they can do that .
she &apos;s bad . &quot;
so let &apos;s see .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
what do these people need ?
i don &apos;t think that .
i thought about it .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
they use their hands .
so how does that work ?
how interested they are .
that would have been okay .
what are media today ?
you can go in .
so where do we go ?
so it &apos;s true .
how do we know this ?
because you know what ?
it &apos;s not a country .
why do we do that ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
bg : thank you .
this is a wish .
and i was an artist .
let &apos;s call him don &apos;t .
not school management .
and the one needs to go back .
we can do it differently .
they even do bet .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
a tremendous challenge .
there &apos;s no food .
it &apos;s against justice .
but the wrong things .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
i &apos;m a writer .
here &apos;s another example .
i promised kids .
it feels great .
i swear it .
i wonder .
it &apos;s not going to do that .
thank you very much .
why should we do that ?
thank you .
here &apos;s an example .
you see it immediately .
not toxic in it .
but i went on to work .
or bombs or bombs .
i &apos;m going to go here .
there are two options .
we need energy wonder .
why does this happen at all ?
oh . a moment .
i want to tell you .
what do you want to do ?
this is what happens today .
and i was working on .
so she was back .
and so it was .
yes , here it is .
i agree with you .
and why is that ?
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what had to be done ?
i mean the soul .
you compare the same .
in china , it was different .
lucknot , yes ?
but that &apos;s not a protection .
give you pee a chance .
does anyone see something particular ?
and i always had .
very expensive mobility .
people were playing crazy .
what creates the illusion ?
my gut feeling again .
just after a journey there .
first of all , limits .
i created one .
yes . well , good .
imagine the camera .
jk : both of them .
but it &apos;s even worse .
this is what you see here .
thank you very much .
be a mentor .
maybe 10 times as many .
but it didn &apos;t .
the data came out .
this is a great question .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
it has billions of them .
did you see these guys ?
but there &apos;s something else .
here &apos;s another example .
is it photography at all ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
ohhh .
and then it became international .
there was remixes .
let me summarize .
okay , some more .
the answer to that is no .
only on . a lot of fun .
my name is amit .
he had the experience .
it keeps you fresh .
this is a great question .
is this your opinion ?
it &apos;s almost an identical structure .
and it &apos;s got better .
that &apos;s what they did .
it &apos;s very much like him .
this is the city .
good afternoon , all together .
am i going to like the color ?
ooh , thank you .
some have come and gone .
i think i don &apos;t think much .
dk : 60,000 .
there &apos;s an old study .
it wasn &apos;t bold .
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s not for emotions .
it &apos;s called paul open .
now , what did you believe ?
who will make it safe ?
first , we have the population .
i don &apos;t like that question .
but what do your fish eat ?
let &apos;s call it a little bit .
this is pre-bills .
the work of the interpret .
but where are we useful ?
they had no mass media .
how do we actually work ?
... his own story .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
so , what does that mean ?
well , what does that mean ?
private sphere has to be given .
there are online criminals .
we have three main groups .
it was still fish .
he always showed up here .
and then it happened again .
i felt really good .
and many people forget this .
crisis . death . disaster .
it would be inertia .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
it &apos;s not our problem .
we lost the contact .
why not think about that ?
we love technology and creativity .
it would be non-knowledge .
we &apos;re constantly pushing up each other .
and this opens up a map .
but what do we do with this ?
that &apos;s something about it .
what do i look at ?
his name is tempt .
is it going to have my size ?
that sounds crazy , right ?
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
we need to spread the message .
this is what most of you know .
you also have to understand that .
this is what you see down there .
i want to ask you something .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
i find this fascinating .
i find this fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was destroyed on the ground .
this is what it looks like .
is it about light ?
i grew up in india .
this is the short-term .
you see the water coming .
i had a good life .
so what happened for years ?
who are these relatives ?
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
these changes are in terms of change .
how about fitness ?
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
but the key thing is ...
he &apos;s working with this .
and then they set up .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
the orange tractor .
they really loved it .
but i felt bad .
the two guys called me .
woman : survivors technology .
very frightening .
what &apos;s the soul ?
we don &apos;t produce more ourselves .
i can say everything .
he went up and down .
what can we do ?
this is what the graphics looked like .
now , i get to the end .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
it sounds maybe bad .
we were 20 people .
so we &apos;re too many .
you can &apos;t have bones .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
or is it possible ?
from conflicts , creativity comes from creativity .
so what do we need to do ?
they had no books .
this is felix .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
thank you for your attention .
this was the beginning of the journey .
excellent me awe .
and then everybody went down .
they saw the great impact .
first legacy , second .
well , i was the next one .
you know , who &apos;s normal ?
and finally , episode .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
the same thing , only bigger .
who is successful ?
you want to feed the world ?
i wanted to support them .
it &apos;s almost nothing more left .
i just loved two .
one place is south korea .
again , you &apos;ve got it again .
this is such a natural thing .
my wife told me .
and how did that feel ?
that &apos;s what you can train .
does it make curiosity ?
so it &apos;s circle .
so , why now hack ?
this happened to christmas .
what is this for a thing ?
like that , you know .
they could do it better .
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
i don &apos;t have to worry .
and that &apos;s nothing else .
is that reasonable ?
so that &apos;s the good news .
it was a huge success .
so they saw something magic .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
but can &apos;t be a problem at all .
they always say , why ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
it was just not invented yet .
nonetheless , it should work yet .
anyone know what this is ?
for example , these perception in context .
this is a game outside .
this is god , you know ?
but it was very sad .
so let me remind you .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
and is the x .
sometimes i urge too much .
but they &apos;re doing the job .
they &apos;re connected to those two people .
her mother left her alone .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
think about your own decisions .
this picture is from this place .
i see this plussion .
and it took 18 months .
tell me about this world .
this is very risky .
and that worked very well .
again , jaw showed him four .
i learned everything .
and there are hundreds of them .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there &apos;s good news .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
that really made me sad .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
but it &apos;s not that fast .
how can we help you ? &quot;
sometimes the illusion is the illusion .
no , there was never been a chance .
the story is not over .
what &apos;s happened on this day ?
well , then we want .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
they come from the artists .
i shouldn &apos;t say that .
the power can explode .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
she did it for three years .
you can have this cloud .
the data was not available before .
play is not silly .
well , how could that happen ?
is it all about education ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
so , we can .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
everybody talks about happiness today .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
play doesn &apos;t just mean child games .
and that was 19 years ago .
what would you like most ?
they create a epic story .
they have so much uncertainty .
the data is constantly reviving .
nobody ever said that before .
so paul is a terrorist .
and that &apos;s what he actually says .
don &apos;t take anything out there .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what should our beliefs look like ?
this is a lot of volume .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
i &apos;m almost never doing it .
she was back and die .
and of course , that &apos;s incredibly promised .
and again , this is the representation .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
an autistic student .
when it &apos;s the waste .
so not like detox .
and that &apos;s what we take .
we depend by two countries .
everybody needs a gold glass glass .
let me be here . &quot;
people were still happy .
it was my first sunset .
in fact , he melted fish .
my name is brian goldman .
they share their experiences with others .
the white lines stand for population .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
he showed up on the algae .
this is just not technological .
there are four and a half thousand people .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
every waste is nutrient .
and we &apos;re too many .
so the question is : how ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and it was an incredible experience .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
but there are two problems .
i started feeling better .
but , you know what ?
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
and that was fun .
i talk a lot about these questions .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
we &apos;re in an area .
and that &apos;s what we did .
basically , they do the same thing .
this is now one of the images .
what other marks do ?
and then something weird happened .
they can play with different ways .
the whole building was made of water .
italy wins . yeah .
on the morning , before the game .
that would have not been a problem at all .
creativity had to sort of get out of it .
today , everything is easy to have .
the nurse asked the nurse .
i shouldn &apos;t do that .
maybe even in our cell phones .
and it starts with a doctor .
i &apos;m going to tell you something .
we use the energy of the sun .
this is all metadata .
because i can say everything .
it will always be similar to you .
but slowly , it started .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
what are they trying to do ? &quot;
we &apos;re not going to go on .
what lessons do we learn ?
and the shape plays a role .
you can &apos;t store energy .
then i can translate the whole thing .
okay , that really makes courage .
once we started a vivid one .
my second mistake was worse .
and it &apos;s a 257 .
we all love baseball , right ?
somehow , kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
they &apos;re going to be free to the computer .
because does anybody have masses here ?
and then they refer to him .
below , other things should not suffer .
this one has the biggest impact .
the movement reasons to write it .
anyway , not to navigate .
and that &apos;s all at the beginning .
the truth is more like this .
do you want to solve jeans ?
that &apos;s how you can &apos;t do anything .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
their family gathered .
thank you very much for your patience .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
what else is risky ?
be just who you are .
i remember my first fire .
what is a story that looks like ?
dark . dark .
i was trying to do something exciting .
but very , very effective , yes ?
but we need the whole thing .
nuclear missions , yes ?
this is completely belonging .
let &apos;s take the quiet .
hmmm , my brand ?
that &apos;s frightening .
that sounds frightening .
next : nuclear energy .
a very exciting phenomenon .
i wanted to be normal at the time .
i &apos;m going to show you now .
once the judge saw me .
we can &apos;t just do that .
so i went to the court .
i got something scared of technology .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
and there are several reasons for this .
they sell certificate .
it &apos;s not documented .
why did i go to medicine ?
it can know where we are .
it spreads rapidly .
all adults were aware of the risks .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i like things that are different .
i went to prison -- hard .
it didn &apos;t make any sense in my eyes .
this is a child game , right ?
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
and this video is in real time .
the game begins -- silly .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
what about longevity ?
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
so the correlation is low .
so , look what happens .
it &apos;s really changed the dynamics .
so i just started to play .
and then we said , okay .
yes , these are the data .
i shoot something through the head .
have you been disgust ?
this is like learning from the weekends .
because for me , it means memory .
how and what does he feel ?
we say in germany .
so you can &apos;t do that at all .
music is medicine . music changes us .
it &apos;s really hard to figure out .
and you know what i learned ?
these will be unresistant .
but what &apos;s going to come to the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and this is a very simple question .
this has nothing to do with science .
and that can make a big difference .
but there &apos;s another reason .
anyway , we need a solution .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
that &apos;s what i hear , thank you very much .
they flew the channels .
maybe two percent .
we started 15 years ago .
how far do you get there ?
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
you know what &apos;s neither ?
so the first step is to take a interpretation .
and it &apos;s still not a interpretation .
that has to be the difference .
if you come to that , yes ?
you can show you , i was there .
this is just the minimum .
we can regain our nutrients .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
on the book and on the picture .
this image reminded me of something .
i find them abandoned .
sunlight and co2 is a method .
but maybe this is not the case .
and what does this mean for the designers ?
i &apos;d like to show you this .
it was a pretty fate project .
this is where he leaves the sun .
this is the memory .
these rivers take off too much .
a has these benefits and risks .
our newspapers are read by millions .
lego made it possible for everyone .
privacy is not the debate .
they were genetically engineered .
i &apos;m the new doctor .
i &apos;m not going to take the same lost .
baseball is full of great statistics .
because we live on a water planet .
do we really want to go into this direction ?
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
and these are the neural structures .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
oh , my time is over ?
something comes in to me .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
so we measured his movement .
this is a picture of the object .
it was quite popular .
you see something fun here .
i really like nice clothes .
he can only use his eyes .
but the truth is far away .
you can do that all the time .
so this crazy story might be true .
who would ever want to be one wish ?
the situation would have been too easy .
her father died shortly after her birth .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have cents .
we need to increase the complexity slowly .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
here &apos;s your brand .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
but then they really want deep into it .
you want to orient in the museum ?
that was more concrete .
okay , you really want to know this ?
and i had to go out of the city .
we won some prices .
who doesn &apos;t want to healthier children ?
it makes shame with kids .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
no , i really mean it .
i hold the knife in my hand .
and the goal is very simple .
i shoot my era back .
architects and engineers , for happiness .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go .
now i see greg &apos;s moon .
a billion people are hungry today .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
i fell out of this fish .
no , no , that &apos;s not going .
and this sounds very different than before .
he was already over sixth .
i started a institutional institute .
they even bring funding with one .
the film was not delivered yet .
we need to think about what marks are .
what do you do with it ? &quot;
i call it the radiation .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
this is ideology , not science .
and that brought me through this .
today 6.8 billion people .
very simple , it &apos;s going to come .
it &apos;s busy busy .
the names today are teaming .
automatically , he goes to the right idea .
this is how nature is imagined .
but it requires a lot of planning .
we can reinvent everything else .
in the way we think of north .
and it depends on phosphorus .
often in the third , again , forget .
longer than those other networks .
the stones are cows .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
it &apos;s about changing values .
i started with my usual talk .
this is a very sensitive question .
i learned this from my grandmother .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
we haven &apos;t written this app .
and every morning i jump on it .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
it &apos;s very good .
what words would you describe ?
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
there are also worlds .
asking , what is the right thing ?
the people over the urine .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
the survivors are the spirits .
they raised their blood pressure .
thank you , but the best thing is .
we &apos;ve achieved a kind of balance .
happy productivity . fantastic !
the result of that was catastrophil .
and everyone in this room has to be in there .
here &apos;s the olive oil .
bjurn smile .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
we &apos;ve been running a lot of ways .
this is maybe being transformed .
my brother starved me .
these are the apple saras .
i talked a lot about magic .
who could have looked at this ?
oh my god . oh , my god .
who do you really want to inform with that ?
completely on a destination .
what do you think is next ?
they have them . they always have them .
so this is a harm .
it &apos;s been constant .
they literally put the pinnacle .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
i hope you give me a show .
most of all , when he died .
so it creates two circles .
the side product is clean water .
that sounds very unusual at first .
we built unique elements here .
you lose rare animals .
it will touch them deeply .
he died , broken through the story .
here you can see how the building works .
they went through each other .
tell you what you feel .
the other one had died .
let &apos;s do a little intersection .
here you have this little mechanism .
it &apos;s been melting .
it &apos;s interested in the firefirm .
the question is , what &apos;s going on now ?
the students will be divided after grades .
these things are logically correct .
and here you feel it .
for energy , i noticed this .
i &apos;ve tried to understand them .
all these generations need just a few milliseconds .
and no one seems to be upset .
that i wrote these crazy things .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
and the curiosity does not learn .
this is also a paradigm shift .
a dalmaid , right .
you can first see from the back to the front .
so from modern in the computer society .
and that &apos;s what they do .
we need to get far , and that &apos;s very fast .
it &apos;s about a new supply of america .
these are all kinds of questions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they &apos;re the healing countries of someone .
we walk through initiational rituals .
now look at this curve .
wiki skills just belong to our lives .
i promised people in death row .
they kept us inspired by that .
maybe some mutations .
so scott gets this fruit .
we worked up to the night .
so i followed my building feeling .
he moved back to silence .
now we saw the reverse effect .
listen , all the audiences have applaud .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
so ... so , not so optimistic .
he switches the bloodstream .
let &apos;s start with the real thing .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
they had a concept of blue blood .
i thought everybody could do that .
i &apos;ve never met him personally .
even cats look at this video .
there was jimmy kimdrum .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
how would you describe your brand ?
we &apos;re talking about cows , fresh .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
no , that was what i thought .
i &apos;m a redundancy person .
this is usually not the route .
this is a painting of a circle .
the roof was also covered with water .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
and women argued the successful thing .
we can support them to be good .
look at what it does .
the main man disappeared me .
sexual reproduction goes to the picture .
i &apos;ll read you in front of you .
this is &quot; the world without oil . &quot;
that &apos;s the truth . i believe it .
we &apos;re talking about twenty of it .
it was really incredibly profound .
he shaped his head , no .
this is going to happen in april next april .
we also got very accurate data .
behind seven mountains and so on .
the mechanism comes from the gap .
but with the right design , please .
we can support them to be good .
alone , what is information ?
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
there was never been a time before .
and even lomborg thinks about it .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what &apos;s going on ?
and also , these sources are underlying .
how will you feed the world ? &quot;
this is an ecological network .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
the chef had checked him .
you put it on the box .
this is such a tragic part .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been represented .
what &apos;s going to take five milliseconds ?
i see the dalmatiner .
it might take , until it &apos;s invited .
maybe you have to see a look behind it again .
no , no , too far .
and this picture was recorded by atlas .
156 nations send our television channel .
they called their internet connection .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
she was not disgust yet .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
this is the system where we live .
but i was looking at these questions .
and that was what i felt .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
you want to give you the wishes .
something very strange happens here .
and that was the outbreak of the break .
i learned some very simple things .
it can know how we keep it .
so it creates a feedback loop .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
this is a humble little app .
the ufer comes from another place .
&quot; they didn &apos;t let them go . &quot;
i lived in parallel worlds .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and i &apos;d like to read them .
there &apos;s another aspect in history .
you can be locally and intuitive .
tell me a little bit about this part .
make it possible -- you &apos;re all here .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
anybody even know what that is ?
so this is the reason for this project .
it &apos;s called &quot; i jump with me . &quot;
let me tell you a little bit about it .
but that kind of conditions don &apos;t exist in us .
we come back to these people later .
we can do something like this .
so the first exciting primate .
and there &apos;s lots of collaborators .
daniel kahman : sure .
everybody would like to make people happier .
the dosage also plays a role .
and why ? intelligent food changed .
it &apos;s gray to millions of people .
we now have masses in this country .
not even the truth will be free .
because now you can apply a three-sentence .
you see the timeline on the top .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
but it &apos;s not just about words .
thank you , danny kahman .
we get an absolutely flat line on it .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
because we don &apos;t want to shoot genes around ?
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
they lead the process , they understand it .
there &apos;s a lot of stuff that has to come together .
and what do you do with the garbage ?
bad ? i was completely confused .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and then he can just run off .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
his personal infection of the seaweed erosion .
i &apos;m trying to do this over one .
it only has to work as the present .
but we start to see a change .
this is a year more hydrogen river .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
it &apos;s a small virus killing bacteria .
now this level of intuition is going to be very important .
so littingbird &apos;s open source .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
they grow five centimeters .
maybe i did it with good reason .
&quot; pale blue blue blue . &quot;
now let &apos;s take something else .
it &apos;s all from our own pockets .
normal people are not accessible . &quot;
as an artist , i think the relationship is very important .
here you see roberto dance .
and no matter , italy won the end .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
but the game is a formal transformation .
thank you . i have a question to you .
he had had 20 minutes of music .
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
that &apos;s just an insurance method .
it should contain the two elements .
shake the environment , make less waste .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to talk about .
yes . it doesn &apos;t do anything else than discover .
the goal of the movie is transparency .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it was a tension .
what they need is a new medical culture .
alone , complaining and without support .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
i think our identity is threatened .
many of my clients are very young .
my cousins all over the place .
we saw some fantastic representations .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
here are two different dirty strings .
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i have it on my laptop . &quot;
i &apos;m going to act directly with the artist .
a whole shell cool food .
the difference is perceived as loss .
in two hours , they &apos;re building down everywhere .
the emergency room took all the strands .
no insurance can create quisition .
there &apos;s a lot of great books to this topic .
so this was a problem for supercomputer .
this country is different from 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
you can predict the predictions . why is that ?
what are the application i doing ?
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
isn &apos;t half or a quarter ? &quot;
so what can we close from all this ?
so basically a translation of translation .
no tree is carbon neutral .
and on , now you see it always .
the next step is now within these communities .
he was invited every lot of natural videos .
this is just the workforce .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
this really does the fuel problem .
and ecological was a catastrophe .
this is one , part of her .
it wasn &apos;t just before you know ?
in other areas -- the world of communication .
this is my supermarket . no big one .
but western governments are also helping themselves .
sleeping lack is ubiquitous .
i &apos;m going to be tired of how we all do .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
if you burn coal : no .
tell you , there &apos;s no prediction .
can you play it in blue ?
no , we see what &apos;s in there .
and there &apos;s a central point .
well , everybody has eats .
this is how much the norm says .
what are the archaarchical models now ?
and the list can be endless .
so , that was my primate motivation .
regardless of america . find more .
and the problem is not the technology .
it &apos;s the average performance of the sleeping .
we asked around , and nobody knew it .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s got us kind of sweeping .
and then it looks like this .
do you remember the winds ?
so , help me a little bit .
imagine mozart .
i &apos;m happy that i &apos;m there .
the water quantities have increased .
they worry about that we &apos;re bad for .
man 3 : i &apos;m the museum of the museum .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a lip pen .
now , the instruments have evolved .
i want to tell you a little bit about this .
in fact , a viral video didn &apos;t want to make a viral video .
in this three-sentence , three sentences are coming in .
you still know from school .
you can zoom in very easily and zoom in .
now i add a bass .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
if not , jellyfish today are someone else .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
they laughed more than they do here .
your problem is that you have too little .
third : escalation of expectations .
the official dogma of what ?
they just listen to them and then start talking .
let me show you how they work .
it &apos;s a game called the following .
i call them &quot; the income billion . &quot;
we think of energy cycles today .
that &apos;s what it is . thank you .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
you &apos;re going to go around and amuse .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
imagine an airplane full of rings .
that means something that &apos;s built in the city .
second half of time . end of normal play .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
imagine that just for a moment .
raise your hands . let me see .
maybe we can see wishes as a change .
dumingly , it &apos;s not much better .
people suffer . people fighting .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
you know that science is not a company .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so , this really struck me .
i &apos;ve tried to preserve the body .
life has not changed since centuries .
but that &apos;s how many of us got aid for years .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
my fourth technique : predictions for complexity .
the third technique : categorization .
it &apos;s a thousand square miles .
you come up with two because of it -- very simple .
you &apos;re supposed to tell me something about my brand .
it was something that we knew to do .
but reality is always unpredictable .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
donnerday : self-confidence is the key .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
i wanted to rebuild the health of a disease .
now , if you think about a piece of stuff .
what ? that really left me .
we used to grow intelligent food .
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
we forced them . puff .
my parents are 80 on the jews .
and there &apos;s the ladder problem .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drinking information . &quot;
you can jump directly to a certain exception .
you can dive into a particular year .
because that &apos;s what it is , right ?
shake the environment , needs less energy .
this is what &apos;s called osit-sit-model .
now you see the dalmaid .
and the two final ones are here today .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
this has to go down , down to zero .
but i didn &apos;t disagree with it .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
and in the time , they can react to other things .
our goal was just to say it , okay .
and yes , i &apos;ll go again again .
all of this is compassionate about it .
but everything that &apos;s in there is useful .
this will be compared to china in a second .
the phosphorus problem is much critical .
in any case , you do that in there .
the permanent ice is marked with red .
and if not , still dance your dance .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
my mother asked us to touch their hand .
seriously -- the concrete !
well , this cartoon makes some exceptions .
here &apos;s a few things on the hampton .
so this is how the supermarket is .
i thought i could integrate myself .
we still think it &apos;s originally .
the three words said , do you remember ?
i remember it was yesterday yesterday .
here &apos;s the chance to do something .
well , i cheated the courtyard .
i said , &quot; ok , oma . &quot;
we &apos;re in the middle of this overwhelmed point .
i work in the solar technology industry .
and let me show you a simple example .
but it has an unexpected turn .
so that made sense , it was fit together .
yet , we seem to be happy with it .
we &apos;re more than that , we are citizens .
scott was down to human being .
and here &apos;s every piece of very well planned .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
is it about the details or the color ?
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
no one has to put ecological ideas .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
i think maybe i heard more hands .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
eeeee ! no , thank you !
and this is a million-dollar concern .
so at this point , we need digital security systems .
so again , this was really good together .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
sexuality comes in many different forms .
so they put them off ; they save the shoes .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
what we want to do is create the future .
i &apos;m not going to come in the real life of this feedback .
there &apos;s a lot of happy codes .
let me show you this from near .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
complain . complain .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
they were just like the people in this room .
my grandparents put this number down to 70 .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
we need to use more research for more research .
there &apos;s every footprint on top .
i &apos;d normally take the needle out here .
there &apos;s somebody sitting in the back who had no childhood .
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
let &apos;s do that as if we have a machine here .
what did they believe in these design students ?
this is going to be a key element of this impact .
they live with chemosynthesis .
i was totally enthusiastic , you know .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue &apos; government .
and every night they fly 240 miles back .
every morning , they fly 240 kilometers to the farm .
how is the formula ? &quot;
natural light then is smart .
this is what nobody did in the world .
picasso answered , wait only .
we always create new exciting and conflict .
that the theme of ecology is a globally global .
now i &apos;m going to do something more powerful .
they &apos;re all back to their way back .
and they had to remove what we did .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we &apos;ve just signed down .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
so you can &apos;t put them wrong .
what do you do with certificate ?
this is alfred zalezalz .
there can be a sequence of changes .
and this is very important in medical research .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for it .
what would you say to someone who believes this ?
then he checked me into the ear .
the rest of the time , they &apos;re delusive .
i start with some simple examples .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
the question is , why people accept that .
and i went back to work .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silicon .
and we continue to increase our expectations constantly .
then i wonder : how could this happen ?
first of all , i thought this would be a game .
the storytelling always needs more senses .
and trying to do the whole thing again with another generation .
today , a lot of people have given the government .
the next week is coming to the market .
she &apos;s got a button .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the process .
the first is a classic , apple .
it &apos;s the way i want to be .
these things have a positive effect .
no one wanted to do something with the film .
what do you believe how the answer will be ?
on the left , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s why i think we need to be leaders .
so we have this awful simplistic idea .
so two pairs , every baby .
ladies and gentlemen , their relatives .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
it was leah beyond the imagination .
the best one is still -- in a second .
so every concert is another concert .
so , not save , avoiding , avoid .
and everything is package or content .
i could go right in front of my house . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
they &apos;re supporting others to talk about their mistakes .
i hired them and made me care of the treatment .
you know how to call a 4000-page call ?
notice two things about this curve .
and i have to say , there was power .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
with 16 , i started illustrating books .
that our contribution to the system is choose .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
he didn &apos;t get out in other countries .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
i never want to be a little different in life .
so i talked a few months later in a conference .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- they &apos;re walking along their fingers .
i want to show you something here first .
and of course , it made it click .
it was summer , and i had shells .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
and they &apos;re not only going to die at masses .
what happened is that we could do that .
they don &apos;t invest time in power .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . i put it on .
these sentences are absolutely logically and correct .
anyway . that &apos;s what i want to do every case .
technical circles gives you the same thing .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for 9 .
i &apos;ve made it very high .
at the beginning , the tribal society is moving through the language .
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
so she &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to the people .
we don &apos;t get an identity ; we invent them .
it was a lot los angeles , and i was in eggs .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
now everybody &apos;s trying to see a little bit of this pattern .
he came to me and hugged me .
everybody who were like this , started sharing themselves .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you do that crazy ?
the country on the land she would roll .
so smartphones , a giant subject everywhere .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
we want to do something against the death penalty .
there are some interesting developments there .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet , one realistic level is realizing .
so for the theme of the day , financial saving .
in fact , no , that was not the mistake at all .
and that &apos;s what i say now is very important .
and we need to improve a lot more on this device .
it happened four and a half years ago in italy .
and i say that this is good .
this is a problem that many players have .
the last three of the five have been embedded .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
stores that off , trigger the rest .
and that &apos;s what these marks did .
well , what &apos;s the brand ?
i want to help you to calm .
both of them are survival , both of them .
as i said , amanda taught our elephant .
there was no cantales .
did you take all your vitamins tomorrow ?
so this was a highly strange experience .
i can &apos;t do it , but this guy can .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
all these windmills are all around them , almost .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
the only thing you had was your head .
so for him , they were just tangible .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
this is a dead turtle .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
i have something that i want to show you .
how would it be to live longer with good health ?
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
and i found this incredibly exciting .
they have the flow of the water .
so , we can &apos;t do these things at all .
in the countries where people are getting money .
and how does it look like this ?
we understood that the weather is global .
and in this head , the memory played off .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is an entirely unhalved patterns .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
everybody in my real neighborhood is gone .
that means we need to get phosphorus .
well , would you choose the same vacation ?
there seems to be an imperative .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 1,000 years .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
now , they understood the advantage of prototyping .
this is the u.s. for hundreds of years .
i think first is the curiosity .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
these were the first calculations of six years ago .
but maybe you can agree with them .
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
it &apos;s not all to be compassionate .
if you fall in somebody else , efficient ?
and we see it &apos;s coming through .
because we don &apos;t feel more effective .
yeah , so what should be biohacking ?
here &apos;s a couple of people who test it .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
there &apos;s a lot of wheels .
the headquarters is right here .
i thought he would have had kidney stones .
and back to my surveys to my doctor .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
we want the number of ugings .
the swiss is oconcrete .
the dna of the dna was an interesting step .
people seem to think politics , is sexy .
but what &apos;s happening with &quot; change &quot; is different .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the labels .
no apple has ever looked like this .
good night , additional rat . &quot;
now he &apos;s going to put a tractor in the scene .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and slope .
if your job is dance , dance .
so we had about 50 of the magnets of the magnets .
these are footage over six seconds .
but don &apos;t always let a bad thing .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
they become rare because we catch them .
so you don &apos;t often miss the income animals .
all of these things are unavoidable .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
i remember it as though it was yesterday .
and it &apos;s going to be a character in the book .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
so every trash was a little different .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
i put my job on 95 kg .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
i said to my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
we found that it &apos;s really strange .
they wanted to have absolutely nothing to do with the project .
the answer is probably not going to be &quot; no . &quot;
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
because otherwise , our problem would be even bigger .
that &apos;s something like our campi .
that &apos;s how they can do the whole movement .
here are the results we just got .
but how do you do that in practice ?
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
this is the problem that i try to solve .
that &apos;s not how happy one person lives .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
... that the dosage is also a role of play .
probably a lot of you know here in the hall of this trick .
yes , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s raise that .
and i have all kinds of little items here .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
well , i understand that . i do that .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
it &apos;s really important that we &apos;re going to get there .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
these stupid films don &apos;t bring us money .
i can put the sequence in the course of it .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
for nathaniel , music means elite health .
is great , then we have a business model .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
because in fact , this man is not interested in evidence .
because we can &apos;t live with this lifespan .
he &apos;s just disappointing her and not himself .
why do i have to afford this little car ?
a phrase with his own attitude .
it &apos;s hardly talking about interpretation in the early class .
because the notes are the only connection to him directly .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
it &apos;s kind of like a sample of poop .
all of this is a game , i have to tell you .
or they didn &apos;t have a photo of obesity .
and this brings us to the one big question ...
they &apos;re virtual reality , and they &apos;re not very much computers .
yes , what are we doing for projects now ?
and the world we lived in .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
if you do it , this is what happens .
and that was not hard to diagnose diagnosis .
i was a forced university student .
well , really good , maybe a all-star .
wealth , not guilty , the result is influenced .
she had the last word in every family business .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we use this word with these things .
and in this case , it looked a neighbor .
and that worked . applause for scott .
i met the decision to pull in the united states .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
and that was an experience in decourage for me .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
that &apos;s just online -- no press , no television .
or are you more a download tribe ?
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
so what are we going to see in the movie ?
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
i want to tell you how we found this .
and that &apos;s the planning behind it .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
each icberg has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
look , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
it &apos;s natalance , and it &apos;s just natalance .
we have the passion of a dictator innovators .
this is moore &apos;s law last hundred years .
thank you for having been at ted . thank you .
we want to create mass ingenuity . &quot;
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
now we do that with drill machines and machines .
this is the call center for service and information .
and we want to put this on a global level .
we have all navigation systems in our cars .
but at the same time , we know that &apos;s not possible .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , let me show you something more about it .
here we were , and this is the painting .
emc represents &quot; they &apos;re called transparency welcome . &quot;
there were a lot of crazy things going on there .
from the avian age to the machine age .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same in disabled movement .
but are we going to make the best of our toys ?
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
you expect to be an extra billion player in the next decade .
but one of them is worse than the other .
but do you know what you don &apos;t have a right ?
i thought we &apos;re going to bring the poker .
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
and then i met a little unusual decision .
so my two passions were kind of driving .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
i don &apos;t know who you know this picture .
i just agree that this is logical .
i think it &apos;s important to teach one .
the question of death penalty is an interesting question .
the child in me is really excited about opportunities .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
al is a hydrant in boston in boston .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
the underwater part comes from a rock .
when i say reality , i mean real reality .
at the moment , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
and how was that for you ? what did it succeed ?
a little bit more about them , they &apos;re not .
it was &quot; in eternal , forever . &quot;
tuesday : adaptation is going to be totally overrated .
the dog ! i was drunk .
would you like to become more attractive and more self-conscious ?
she didn &apos;t like meets and was blue .
people in the middle rooms are coming in right now .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and some of them did not work and manual .
so we &apos;re going to walk away , and where are we going ?
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace the phosphorus .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
we wanted to develop a learning tool for language learning .
i may have another 40 years in me .
now , do you know what the answer to this question is ?
if you want to create hyperlinks between the images .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not perceived as a big loss .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
this is the kind of teacher richer .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a whole bunch of studies now .
and we &apos;re learning and learning the rules of play .
probably one of these numbers must be very close to zero .
and i said , &quot; yes , very much . &quot;
you can say things that have influence around the world .
... could you just show the slide for a minute .
just like , i think we &apos;re doing games today .
in each one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the need for help .
and i went over and i stopped just listening .
they &apos;re also showing themselves on the other side of the book .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
these results have been achieved by several weeks of hard work .
this player is about a episode of a episode .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
there &apos;s a program that may be familiar with .
i &apos;m very grateful for the recommendation here .
you know he was 1835 here .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of it yet .
my mother suffered to nightmare from the boat .
these are the people that shape my worldview .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the border .
we see this in all sorts of different parts of the human life .
and then it was after three months .
it &apos;s right , morality , patory .
the main problem here is similar to aids .
the logic does not say about reality .
i have a nice concrete example of that .
then i say , heart sorry , yes ?
and we find ourselves so often as new as we want to .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re going to bring kids to the world .
his gangging process has changed after that .
i said , &quot; well , oma . &quot;
it &apos;s worthy and weird programs .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
but that &apos;s what this picture is , is a problem .
there are some places that we can apply to .
we called it the digital world &apos;s digital tolion .
because they have specialized skills of processing .
so here are some natural light bulbs .
the second factor is the services we use .
it changed my way to make movies completely .
it &apos;s hard to assess the destruction .
so you could feel like selling him to sell it .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
that means the ants weighs much more than we are .
and we can look at this now .
geh and queue cohen .
so they go out and start to invent them .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
imagine only two other small changes .
how many would be to decide for a good memory ?
and this is so bible the message .
so please listen , if a music is played .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
the logic doesn &apos;t say anything about what it is .
the first two sentences that are logically correct .
in fact , we know that something else is the case .
now this should not be a joke , but that &apos;s what it should be .
do that once , and then you experience the sentence .
we can do these things in different examples .
what we love to love is that it &apos;s an inquiry .
they moved to a science concept .
so these women met , and they just stopped .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and we created an ipah app .
darleans and sponsors were sent .
i want to tell you some of the puzzles .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you zoomed into it . you can actually go into it .
you can see in all these museums here .
how much money is needed to restore that ?
think about it . this attack is generic .
and if it doesn &apos;t , it doesn &apos;t matter .
so we start with a windmill drone .
he says , &quot; power to get up to the title . &quot;
imagine a sound plane .
it &apos;s a completely denial recognition of error .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to develop .
this is another look at the tree of life .
they shared the king in two containers .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
we had no child in this country yesterday .
and i took a while to figure this out .
we repeated these practices with the same students .
you have to be ready to take risks like this .
&quot; look at your predators , pink .
there &apos;s no overwhelming problem of trees .
then you &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s given change .
and the third area that &apos;s actually explained by itself .
i &apos;m looking forward to the conversations with them .
every big picture is the beginning of a cut .
you wouldn &apos;t be hungry , and you know what ?
or are you more like a download tribe ?
the next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
this is the consequence that we have to do .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i said , &quot; please fly in the air . &quot;
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
wednesday : reverse your inner child .
play is the kitt that keeps us both .
if you have something to give you , you &apos;ll give it now .
how would you want to be better than you are at the moment ?
they teach them to open themselves .
antony : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
and here are two patients . these are their records .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive fatal .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
so , a climate change will be terrible for you .
i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times website .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as designers .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
but the volume are far bigger than ever before .
it grows in winter and shrinks in summer .
not just bad , but the worst of all times .
everybody knew your genius was something lam .
we repair them , repair them .
and the world we &apos;re seeing now looks like this .
but these are all roads in the u.s.a .
we dance in the temple and we become god . &quot;
child mortality has increased by a tenth .
this is also where it comes back .
maniok , it &apos;s a half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
we walk into the arms of placebo industry .
in nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
where is the biggest interest , so what really do you do ?
and also , the energy source is very important for them .
we went back to the tick of titanic .
because artists have a broken relationship to lie .
and at all , you &apos;re working a lot less than i do .
or b , because they don &apos;t learn to sing ?
i &apos;m never going to play more like this moment .
it &apos;s a form of reform behavior , yes ?
and less usable or user , it &apos;s friendly .
how can i make something more friendly ?
i don &apos;t see any reason why that shouldn &apos;t be .
so how do we work if we look in there ?
every society is precise by a primarily medium .
and these interactive portraits take each other to each other .
we are now focusing on the fourth generation .
you may have heard that we have built watermarks .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
you get a model that comes from all the earth .
the grandfather of this old man was refused .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
so in other words , i first think what i want .
and i see the same process combined by photos .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it was looked almost 200 million times a year .
they had 3448 different kinds of brand melting .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction to it .
paralysis is a consequence of lots of choices .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
he described one of them as very common .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
at a point , the screen is filled with leaves .
so the pyecological movement has done it .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
this year , it was looked almost 50 million times .
but what about this day , this particular day ?
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
we should put the balls in the cheese .
are they eight and monk like terrain seven ?
the life itself has no voice in this election .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
and in the world , everything made sense for me .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
cidane , in a moment of the head .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
so gender can occur in many different variations .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
and no , it &apos;s not either you or san francisco .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open turkey ?
here &apos;s the current version of this trajectory .
it was a extreme situation . you needed a extreme solution .
and they were sort of the first people of developed toys .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
you never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
i mean , i rarely saw flat lines .
i take that hand . and here &apos;s the knife .
and the film is called &quot; the ecology . &quot;
well , in this area , there are not several thousand goals .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of time .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
well , we set up the mayor hole .
now , today we know everything about where our things come from .
france makes a power . italy makes a gate .
how do you divide people because of their characteristics ?
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressive vity .
he stages five pounds of hope from my consciousness .
is it for others , or is it in us ?
so i say , let &apos;s start the world changing game !
edward caova is a national scientist .
we &apos;re currently spending three billion hours a week playing online .
the biggest difference between them is time with time .
we tried to automate the point of the automation .
bg : a energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
and i say , &quot; limits you not yourself .
with pivot , they can dive into a decade .
but for many people , that &apos;s a little bit too radical .
so i &apos;ve been in my life a lot of fish .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
in reality , the notes are very vague and unprecedented .
because we don &apos;t make things free .
there &apos;s going to be more like my glasses .
as i said , two thousand , it just started .
this is an interactive filming manager .
and oluminescence ! for you , despite the alleviation .
i &apos;m still going to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and everybody knew it worked like this , right ?
i &apos;d rather continue to do this work that i love .
and the question is , are it good or bad news ?
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
this is , &quot; look at your fingers on every light . &quot;
the next step was to find the apps for it .
we still know one where all of the gaps are .
so you just go to google project &apos;s project project .
what other metamwaters have they run through ?
so we don &apos;t have a budget like others .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
this constant feedback is not available in real life .
i &apos;m going to do it for you , and then explain it .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
a research mester to the theme of user interface .
i &apos;m also going to solve what &apos;s in there .
you don &apos;t know anything in this gold glass . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great gestures .
in the future , most crime are going to play online .
we had no words for what we started there .
now he &apos;s on the red list of dangerous species .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
but i really believe that after us , there &apos;s something else .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
cell communities began to abstract information again .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital physical thing .
but that was not the end of the thylacines .
&quot; isn &apos;t &quot; it &apos;s an unfortunate .
i didn &apos;t know how to do that .
it &apos;s a puzzle that will be put together .
urban designer and construction are very interested .
it &apos;s not even online . there &apos;s no recovery .
so this doesn &apos;t work for the memory itself .
our steps in the digital life of life were exponentially .
this is star night , probably never seen that before .
in the course of this discovery journey , i learned a lot .
as a child , i was constantly drawing comic books and so on .
when we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
that &apos;s right now our goal .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things in the same way .
we were just going around like else .
many talk about 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
i was quite obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
so when clear says , there &apos;s no soul .
this is the most difficult part of my talk .
i can &apos;t play as much as play in 20 years .
both cases of me , framed me .
so a lot of testosterone , but no response to it .
so the growth rate accelerates itself .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife like this .
1m is the highest thing i saw .
a manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the goal ?
so just to think of the weighs to think .
these are rooms that can respond to a human being .
now , how do people die in such a hack ?
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and you can see this green point in the middle there .
i sold scores all over the country , around the world .
this is my meat , and i can flip it around .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio knew that , but it wasn &apos;t .
no , that &apos;s exactly the right thing , yes ?
many of you are covered by faces .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
in both cases , it was operated , and it was fine .
she didn &apos;t have a treatable brain damage .
the ethnosphere is great legacy of humanity .
and the fish also had the fortune to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
it was the miserable cross crossing against drugs .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
there &apos;s more behind it , it &apos;s still deeper .
but we only know a little bit about where the things go .
ok , imagine how extreme self-motivation is motivated .
i know what people think when they see this .
ask questions , demand evidence , desire .
i said , &quot; chickens ? &quot;
everything in life is beautiful is not efficient .
as it used to be done earlier in the village .
this is what &apos;s happening to the gene machine age .
we have a political exception in our country .
they put them on the beatmbling machine .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental recovery .
it could be within a newspatial learning process .
... it carries the crowdsourcing .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
i &apos;ve been working in a coal mining piece -- dangerous .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there was a mess he and he said , so ?
that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to go back to the weekly .
so how a human is going to deal with certain things .
and , of course , how designing impact on perception .
for the bottom two billion but it &apos;s a disaster .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambiguity .
lawyer : i &apos;m a lawyer brand .
we have abstract a abstract language .
another example is called virtual reality .
but in fact , it was a great fun at that night .
we had to worry about the lawyers .
it was called the automatic rock .
there &apos;s a certificate point .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was even different .
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to honor ?
he took a famous photo . how did it mean ?
it slows for our big problems .
we see the process that feeds itself .
thylacines ? yes . alive ? alive .
here &apos;s a short video of what we do .
but you can combine something special like this .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
because the paintings find it for them to recommend .
whoever and whales , you &apos;re in the museum of this museum .
the idea is to overwhelm a digital security system .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain it .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
it &apos;s a debate about words , over metaphors .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
in fact , the advanced society is based on energy progress .
this was not a film , not a hd , that was really real .
i wasn &apos;t there at all long ago with miguel .
because you know , that &apos;s a fun thing .
have you ever seen a clical tree ?
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve described .
if you want to get out of it , put together . &quot;
regardless of america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
frost , the man is going to clean every day .
this is a organism that we described in 1996 .
so i &apos;m going to take a step back and look at another way .
i filmed in war areas -- difficult and dangerous .
so we should get better to figure out what the goal is .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
if we build cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
in other words , game is our adaptive joke .
can you imagine something that comes out of tabak ?
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
you can just call a couple of names , and people will understand .
diphere , tubes , child paralysis ...
this is a variation of a thing that was made .
well , the energy rice is over time .
and it was an experience that i couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the movie .
it was immensely immense juggling in control room .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a pig .
it &apos;s this kind of fun , coded taste .
the shrimp eat the physical lankton .
and so he &apos;s flying his elderly circumstances .
and then there &apos;s a lot of simulations of simulations .
but this was not as common in the years .
the musical instruction is the extension of our body .
he has only lived in nevertheless three years .
hey , puma , do you really feel serious ?
a baby needs about a sixth of wind .
so i know of some of the people who don &apos;t have carried .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone from here .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to beat the sun .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
this is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
they go to thabo mbeki in south africa .
but then i thought , you know what we &apos;re honest .
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of them .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
i have a friend who &apos;s driving a passenger .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound .
and because we &apos;re getting older , we &apos;re going to get the wind bigger .
that &apos;s the time you fall in love with .
and even today , we are still very , very strong stories .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and the predictions , as you read , are serious .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
and i &apos;m not expected to change that .
it &apos;s also my great , life-long love and fascination .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
why don &apos;t they buy us if we can &apos;t buy ?
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
a few years ago , i started to develop little-life .
the brows are still describing them as untouched .
my grandfather was in prison during the prohibition in prison .
she was a weapon , strong woman , she had impact .
so , in a sense , the technique gives us the technology .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it realistic ?
but what if you want to see the paintings ?
but my logical side has not liked it .
i just want to tell you a little bit about salad rescue .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . heart happiness .
we also brought little-life schools to design schools .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay bay .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against injustice .
my uncle died at alcohol contacts .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also full .
in fact , we &apos;re also a majority of root community .
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
let &apos;s call the animal beginners , cost it a lot of money .
when a neighbor helps the other , we strengthen our communities .
ohhhhh , wowwww !
they always worry that they lose resurface .
50 percent of their decisions have been met within nine minutes or less .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny chip chip .
and my talk today is mostly about this cognitive act .
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called collecting collections .
open the map , and jump with a click .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a whole lot about transparency .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
you could also use ordinary design -- technology to spread .
one of my friends did it -- richard bboller .
imagine this kind of footprint , you could really start flying .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
these are the kinds of questions that we need to meet .
i was fascinated by the elephant and beauty of biology .
and i can tell you , it was a transformative experience .
we need to start changing the real world into a game .
and this is from an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
i mean , how much do we honor from our memories ?
the more money you deserve the more satisfying happiness .
that all of our survival is linked to every single one .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
and yes , i have a job of how you might recognize .
secondly , the photos should have combined the same kind of lighting .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
for example , this one would be completely logical .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
yes , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to get out of it .
i have that . the first picture is a picture of my family .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of statements .
and the film is going to be called &quot; the ecology . &quot;
i &apos;m jessi and this is my suitcase .
it &apos;s just that i think it &apos;s more likely to be true .
i know what you think , but i &apos;m not a hero .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
i hope you &apos;re excited about it . thank you very much .
but it turns out that this is not all .
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why do we fight this ?
these are a lot of toys through masses , 20 per hour .
so there should be a better at the beginning of my death row .
because they are the ones who are also experts for taste .
the system is so healthy , there &apos;s the water .
i mentioned this to miguel and he kidnapped .
so the pinker also the better the system . &quot;
and then i get an instant , that &apos;s unfair .
and also , what you might think in the mind today .
and the oil is going to replace us by other energy ters .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
like algae -- and other terrible things .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
it was completely exceptional that it could fail .
so that made me go right , and i wanted to do more .
and immediately , i see another pattern that gives you .
yes , this is the bottom down there .
it &apos;s not about resource efficiency , it &apos;s effective .
we &apos;ve been used in holland now over three years .
and if possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the strange ones .
i now know it was the bottom of the ocean .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
i examined wife printer , and she was in breathing .
and the time i collected more and more knowledge .
we &apos;re talking about 300 if a sleeping hit 300 .
in 2010 , we had just connected to two billion people online .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our system .
and the lighting goes through the rest of the book .
&quot; because she kept her tomorrow tomorrow , &quot; he said .
we have the capital of the techno-philanthropy .
this approach for all new things we &apos;re doing creative .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
well , your life itself is not going to be happier .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
here &apos;s a picture of an ordering in kentucky .
he has a formula for 15 .
i can say the canadian is a man .
we &apos;ve moved to that kind of bird age .
this is about 20 feet high altitude , like greenland .
this is the audience that we &apos;ve just done recently .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
but you can , if you look at a foreign foreign .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them good .
and all of a sudden he didn &apos;t seem to be more human .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
or do you want to be more , more powerful , more force .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though that belongs to that .
my great-grandparents died when they were 60 .
well , where should we go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
that &apos;s how they &apos;re all in the prevention of delhi .
and of course , it can never give you in germany . &quot;
one government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
and the more i was talking , the more i should tell you .
and i celebrate , i wine like a little kid .
obviously it &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
if you &apos;re happy , you move other happy people .
players are masters in spiders in spiders .
how can we translate these emotions into reality ?
so , from the same , bad team under the best one .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worry .
so people have really been thinking about creativity in the west for a long time .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
one of the things that was that the telephone was never broken .
according to his behavior , we can predict the structure and predict function .
a few months went over and i had just forgotten everything .
even who kills somebody is not just a murder .
for example , the invention of language was a little step into this direction .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
and this video was actually launched in january of january .
each of these themes , of course , was a lot of smaller decisions .
there are many more , but i don &apos;t have time .
today i want to tell you about circles and openings .
they interact with their environment and their experiences .
this trick can lead you to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
you know , there were no mandarin in paradise .
yes , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting about the vision of vision .
i apologize that i have to get so much shorter .
second , what economists call the tunisian tunnel .
and i think it &apos;s worried that the world looks like this .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
so it changed nothing , and yet it changed everything .
we &apos;ve just dropped the 7-billionaire brand .
and then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
so , if you could do the light again .
it was a store called dragger .
are you here ? you see a little nervous .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
the things that will only be used in technical systems .
so , the device you see there that doesn &apos;t work .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
they did that by making the country irrigation .
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
they &apos;re called the fear . they &apos;re called the risk .
second , when he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have soul .
there &apos;s only the second best , the firemen .
they can smile away , where they go and stand .
an amazing error . one of nine innocent school .
this is what i want to show you two , maybe three examples .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually going to have a rolling ice sheet .
this is somebody who &apos;s safe at the rest of 10 .
we used to be used to that things happen .
i had a 14-year-old boy , poor black boys as a mandster .
they &apos;re in there , they want to go to the end of the gangs .
and then people could eat that , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
because that &apos;s where the ownership is going to happen .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what &apos;s your feet ? &quot;
and then we started acting with insulin .
the conventional system sees all over the world .
i &apos;m explaining what these daughters could mean .
that &apos;s why you help with , ask people at the time .
but also our perception of self , how do they disappoint us , because too .
and other example are the ambitious systems , intelligent systems .
how many turks have the house where you live ?
we think it &apos;s clean -- and we still smell well .
i think that , and i feel that , we should teach this .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
some people were disappointed that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
i sent them home without talking to my doctor .
the cost of solar power last year was 50 percent .
we need to let ourselves go to the machine government of government .
there &apos;s a direct backyard system for this .
the launch of software takes a couple of years .
and sure , we can find fastopods .
cats look at cats looking at this video .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
and what was noticed was that i needed a experts .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned language .
i just wish i could grow up my kids .
and a part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
it has eye view of life , after another one .
and i translated them to fund an expedition expedition .
we &apos;re talking about the flow of information overwhelming .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering collection .
that &apos;s the first year in the first year of its advertising .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
so they pull around and make art installations like this .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
i was shocked , and i was crushed to the inside .
i went through the emergency division on my way home .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
i say that because i think identity is very important .
because all these new technologies today are feeding themselves .
because their lives were left by whether they did the job right .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
i knew she was coming to give up .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure to something , we do with it .
a typical walmart gives you 100,000 products today .
do you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical page says .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you is what truly amazing .
in the example , it was about finding details of finding details .
he said he didn &apos;t say that . he will ask questions .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought in .
if they didn &apos;t move anymore , they dig them .
wouldn &apos;t you want to do these changes in your genes ?
what would you like to have to have if you could only have one ?
again , what kind of potential do we want to call ?
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own episode .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
when we looked at how emotion with income .
and this is a little hard to justify , i think .
there were no christmas trees . we did it all .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is mimic .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
the one farm that your animals don &apos;t feed their animals ?
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
the words , as long as his friends , spotled his own .
and we found that there was actually a context .
do you know how many decisions you make on a typical day ?
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
so the driving force behind is cybersuperpower .
i didn &apos;t stop my wife with my wife two years .
the pilot gave the machine to the hudson river .
the openness is , death is part of life .
that keeps us on the distance , and makes us continue to evolve .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
it &apos;s about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
you see the person who wonder what happens in the inner .
in most of my activities , i have two chicks .
it turns out that dna is synthetic synthetic .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we think about our future as an immense memory .
well , the memory itself is a storyteller .
what it ruined was the memories of the experience .
we &apos;re going to meet in the next few days .
there &apos;s an incremental anger there .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
a fish up , but also a bird reserve .
this second fish , which is another kind of love of love .
this first , which was more like a passionate monkey .
he &apos;s very happy about it , because he disappointed it .
because the music is a language , and it &apos;s a language to communicate .
and first of all , to ask , what is the right thing .
but i &apos;m going to do it just a little bit more curious .
i started thinking , i should just trigger the project .
we can obviously look at the mosquito problem .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
just to precise time , they agree .
if the museum gave us the picture , click on it .
so you can ask : how happy is this alive itself ?
most of them will be completely ignored by the memory itself .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
does a single one in the audience ever see somebody in masses ?
it turns out you can get that to zero .
you can test it after my talk in your immune speakers .
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum is very , very many ideas .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
so , again , in any store , you can get things back .
so the question is , how do we deal with these windmills ?
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
so , for example , shake the environment , less car .
and life lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
so , if i take you to the side , you take care of it .
am i looking like this as i could just write a song ?
she said it would be like a donation of air .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
they add a blue to a green , and they can make light .
but they &apos;re not going to be the preferences of prisoners .
these pictures are extraordinary because the transition goes very quickly .
yet , we &apos;re still coming to the galapagos islands .
more and more people came in , just because they were angry .
it was the fear of terror that shaped your life .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
we have lots of cells that are not based on themselves .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot of it later .
and what &apos;s below is what we call bureaucracy .
but where would the next aed to help this patient ?
they need to meet 62 different decisions to design their car completely .
well , don &apos;t get me wrong , it wasn &apos;t that easy .
almost as if we were prepared for our lives for it .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego space .
i was the only one who could talk to the airplanes .
so the records were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
think of this as an image , as a flying dot .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going to do .
this is going to affect politics , i think , in the coming years .
we found this in terms of happiness &apos;s happiness itself .
they dismiss their judgments . they almost never do it .
usually , most people start to orient themselves on the task .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
if you walk , yes , every footprint destroys the ground .
if we overrun it , we can get a little bit back .
the most powerful mountain worker is the head of massey .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
there &apos;s a magic amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a book .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will only be worse .
and the online criminals of online criminals are very easy to understand .
because through marine protected areas , we &apos;re basically doing the past .
i want to end with a story that really has really excited me .
sometimes i lose weight . a story to end .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
so now we replaced the timeline again .
so today , evolution can happen in the time of microseconds .
here he likes a rare glimpse .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
we could reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
autocolors , outside the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
they don &apos;t even come from the museums .
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
i became part of the miracle , not to die this day .
it &apos;s called eyeyeese , and you can see the description .
this is the average size of a greenhouse iceberg .
i mean , what does anybody do with so many output ?
and as a general term , we can use the word &quot; sexality . &quot;
so the question is , can we do that ? i think .
we all need to believe in the last things that we can &apos;t see .
let &apos;s call it miguel . actually , it &apos;s called miguel .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to do in the first place .
then the same happens as in a good , talked about conversation .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
we take images of this mini-big bang in detectors .
economists call this a parallel improvement .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
the freedom to maximize is to maximize .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
this is a whole book , an example of non-verbal data .
and of course , we share all the same adaptation .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in the fda .
there are accidents in front of us , like the intact .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
innovation , creativity , creativity and development is not just coming from our heads .
i want to help you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
because frankly , every project has his own marshmallow .
ceos are about average . but this is going to be interesting .
because although it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of questions .
this is one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
this deputy ran across the elderly black black .
but i don &apos;t know how receiving people are going to be .
you &apos;re about the block , and you take it as an openness .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the temple room .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
the first one of these is a contradiction , complexity .
they invest a lot of their time in the construction of the structures .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little it will be supported .
usually you &apos;re just kind of danger and some people are coming , not others .
now he mentioned the mineral needs of physical lankton kton .
i take the breathing of the audience , consciously , aware or unconscious .
you know , that &apos;s the real truth behind the foreign truth .
but the question i want to throw up is : why not ?
and the best thing about this is perhaps what we expect in health .
this is technology support innovation that &apos;s today .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
wr wants to help people who have been convicted .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
how did he get to look for this particular kind of help ?
let &apos;s quickly jump to moma , again in new york .
tempt is going to be part of the show , which is pretty embarrassed .
we produce androgen , and we &apos;re talking about androgenes .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
that &apos;s scandalous , and we should be ashamed .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
but while they talked to different people of this world about this possibilities .
the ones today have a renewable amount of energy from five percent .
and they did this with the so-called lead-hands-on maps .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s right .
so i &apos;ve been busy with when , of course , what &apos;s intuitive or intuitive .
and these are just the biohacker , the individual people .
it means that we reach a cultural impact next to the scientific influence .
this struck me when i wanted to dare my jeans .
he invited the king of sideways to the dinner .
but somehow we can get it from this problem .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve had over the last year .
but instead of getting into panic , he just stopped .
how about contributions that we can &apos;t even predict ?
if you look at the people you have to do it .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
imagine every single person is controlled by people .
okay , let me get a little bit of blood for you .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
new investments to create good jobs .
six speakers : social case . seven : 65 deaths .
and i hope you &apos;re going to play with me like this and play .
that means that the players are safe from 10 to 10 .
a long time ago , there were gray whales there -- 500 years ago .
in many of you will say , these are crazy ! that &apos;s good .
the x-ray interpretation of a piece of piece is this comparable .
from my eye view , i saw the janitors and go off .
fireflies in a glass , i always found quite exciting .
for example , this image has about 10 billion points , i think .
so i decided when i was 15 , to be diving .
here &apos;s what i do . we &apos;re looking at right here .
and within less years , lego went to every household .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
by the way , i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer .
and i want to show you my outcome for this week .
56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t come from court cases .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-replicating .
i asked him how to become a fish experts .
there was the nuclear research facility plant .
from this time , there &apos;s an anecdote that you may know .
it doesn &apos;t need to whistle a love to whistle or sing .
and six millisecond milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that goes back to a lot , in the cultures of the industrial times .
so i think it &apos;s a very bad hack hack .
i think it &apos;s kind of like seven-dollar dollars or something like this .
this actually took two thousand really simple form that these networks .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
so , this looks like a basketball plaque .
and , if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i didn &apos;t leave me .
well , in fact , the number of violent crime doesn &apos;t change very much .
i ate it first in a restaurant in southern spain .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
it was always as inspiring , so refugee .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
dreamed the trash on the side . went home .
alone , this airport has a surface of 100 square kilometers .
i like things that are special . i like weird things .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
so maybe you should put a little bit in front of this . &quot;
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leaders .
here you see a cut from this attack -- code .
we &apos;ve got his bed , so he can see outside .
we degrade a human that has value for our society .
we &apos;re going to play a game to get away from the real world .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
what about children &apos;s paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : it &apos;s .
the secret is that the game of the key to these skills is .
this is actually the true melting of human and machine .
a few . probably a lot like this , there are creative people here .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
they produced the highest construction in the least of time .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons of tons on the planet .
i grew up with a cave portion of science fiction .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building siv , not intense .
so here was finally a company who tried to do it right .
the component is always going to be more of the friend you live with .
and i &apos;m not so sure if you really stay there .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little flight .
there was , in my opinion , a very good code .
in fact , nasa showed that there are many of them out there .
they increase the paralysis and the satisfaction of happiness .
well , i wondered how can i really get this ?
it &apos;s an independent area . you control all minerals .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view of the world .
somebody was broken , and the system was fooled .
photos like this : a building line along a lot of vehicles .
the biggest fear had given them , rape and death .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to get out of all these extensions .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange land road .
but again , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
i brought seven of them down , and that &apos;s all .
but a lot of people get caught in a very strange position .
our darm is a wonderful friendly friendly environment for these bacteria .
well , the two types of self takes two terms from happiness to happiness .
well , life itself lives its continual life .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness under research .
it &apos;s just a bold calories . it &apos;s mimic .
the modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
ah , the majority . that &apos;s what i like to see as a doctor .
my inspiration comes from a event which is 2,500 years back .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
smallpox . smallpox have killed billions of people on this planet .
it &apos;s the renewable energy , as they often call them .
this is a fish up in the southwest corner of spain .
since i ask how expertise was this diagnosis diagnosis ?
notized notes have the function of the letters of a writing .
and then these are recipes of the pre-industrial cultures .
that &apos;s what you call navigating about sound and rhythm .
so this is just a application of many that you can do with it .
and then we worked out such a cow cow .
on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to lhc .
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
this is what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
54 percent of the deaths were cut by drilling drivets .
essentially , the concrete stone stone has become the rock of our time .
as it would be with a sentence , never before hearing voices before .
how can a judge change somebody in something that he &apos;s not ?
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lynh mobs .
so programs that can sorrow at the worst numerous animals .
for example , the fish had been recorded on a glorious flight .
opportunities that were not allowed to be encouraged , were encouraged .
so i took a couple of years ago to do that .
after all , we should be willing to welcome the fear .
an eightful , played marke . how is your brand ?
why is it important to start ? what is the red red ?
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely limited by limitations .
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
well , at this night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
and the key indicator of indicator is the extinction of languages .
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s not this test .
and this is called androgene receptor defects .
we &apos;re developing ourselves in common sense , heart creature .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a ph.d. student .
right now , in the present moment , but we have an incredible opportunity .
and soon i wrote an article about intelligent food change .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
so i offered a $ 100,000 prize prize for the winner .
one day this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a beautiful one .
there was no piano at the time at all .
you learn to find the sounds of the notes on the instrument .
even if you were to shoot yourself , you would have emissions .
most of the people know this from the software sector .
this is even live in the internet . you can test it .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nunagerlow .
but nothing was invented to let me go again until now .
and the best part is that they connect with magnets .
some of my cute passively passive passions in the last five years .
i looked in the radar , and it was a little bit of pink .
so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular clay .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
so the dramatic numbers come to the prisoners .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about death penalty .
a child in india says , &quot; i saw a monkeys today . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know a lot about government when i started this program .
this is my wlander . a very simple thing .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
what context is the idea and feelings about them ?
and if those are dangerous , then really bad things can happen .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
if we don &apos;t take a phosphorus and give them phosphorus .
this piece of 50 year-old technology became the magical thing for me .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours per minute .
if you could do it for the people , you could also help me .
and just disappears all of these companies , one after the other .
i &apos;m sad that we never met each other as adults .
think of it , it &apos;s free , no one deserves us .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
and so when we think about this , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of individual alism .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas in our culture .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go to the house .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
specialized skills and processing skills and their combination to success .
people here have contributed to the development of this miracle .
and somehow , we have to change changes that are based on zero .
we find other features of what their rights are .
this is the dream of most perceptions we have .
this is our youngest tester down there .
by the end of march , the lhc will be more functional .
and that &apos;s the message that i went to medical school .
you know how to call a 3,000-year-old league baseball ?
i think that in many places , the opposite of poverty is poverty .
if somebody lies , it &apos;s not just a lie .
and so i think the ted community should be a horse .
and it has been spreading , of course , organic , of course .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say , thank you ted .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
well , finally , the film has a very large amount of momentum .
this is actually just a period of two and a half weeks .
these people will be connected with the film in eternal -- forever .
so all these green areas , these are the most powerful environments .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; sling . &quot;
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of god to go far away .
i went to the car and was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
in the short time here , one thing i realized : ted has an identity .
she said , &quot; this is going to be very , very tired . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good intuition to actually do the experiments .
in my opinion , mass ingenuity has changed our world fundamental .
this is all reality today , and in the future , is going to be much more possible .
so that allows the play to grow up from binary , trust , trust and each other .
this is what you &apos;re saying more , the better .
people said , do you have no fear to succeed ?
i don &apos;t know what you think about me , but i can live with it .
and what i learned is that error is absolutely unbelievable .
i love this : &quot; watson forced human enemy . &quot;
i looked at her and ridiculous , but she looked very seriously .
three months later , i was moved , and the adventure went on .
it &apos;s about being able to overcome dumb goods .
i like a lot of black colors , lots of gray sounds and such a stuff .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony with tony .
we want to use this as a possible impulse for the flyte .
and the question was : how could you connect technology to connect new technology ?
for example , i don &apos;t want to give you the same fish as a human being .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
and that &apos;s something that we need to learn , and that &apos;s very fast .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s violin .
the human being is supposed to have a common ancestry or a common ancestor .
loud and quiet , f and b , etc .
how were his living circumstances , how the society and politics ?
on september 10 , last year , the machine went to the first time .
we have littlivelids of kids , and they play with them .
and when i listened to her , she made keulate sounds .
and i was good , i went off with claud .
but when i ask you , how are you going to do this with your wife ?
you collect information about the piece in the secular literature .
there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they can get involved .
but what if the picture would you link to all of your images ?
you say you &apos;re never going to die the names .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other regional technology .
because the categories tell me how i can hold them apart .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
we should be able to rotate everything we want .
and i tend to see wishes as my shadow .
now , studies have been conducted to see if that was true .
and then you can see what enormous speeds are there .
this is where conservation comes from asia , in the fda .
because a good engineer has either made great cars or nuclear plants .
that was the first beginning of a musical print .
you can only have nuclear missions if you &apos;re not there .
it &apos;s good . the question is , how is it going to go .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
the official faith of all western industrialized societies .
&quot; do you remember the patients that they sent home ? &quot;
we live on a planet where 70 percent is covered with water .
but they just exchange the construction of apartments against cities .
that &apos;s how to lie that you can just apply these logic wrong .
often the music class is so that you &apos;re only learning the notes .
that would be just the letters that you learned to paint .
eight : tsunami warning . nine : cyberattacks .
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
bruno guisi : mark , mark , come back .
now , if it doesn &apos;t seem to be hardly a game , maybe the most essential one .
so we don &apos;t have to control people , we don &apos;t have to be bad .
there &apos;s now all this rumble before the big disorder .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
they knew jewish and bytes that they had to attack .
it was as the football world championship .
in our views , we put in all sorts of uninhabited areas .
and she was much worse than b in the memory .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who suffered both more ? &quot;
we &apos;re not just telling stories when we &apos;re doing things to tell stories .

they hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says everything is connected to everything .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is so often mentioned .
that can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .

an example of another area . monet has painted the soul of erox .
and i want to give you to protocoll that i was here for my part of the jobs .
this was our first attempt to start with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
but interesting is the unique case of the love , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order in which this information is represented .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true that today &apos;s less .
i thought , &quot; do you put the camera out of &quot; mean that we wanted to lead a backward conversation .
so , for example , the number four sticks are very out of this code ; you can &apos;t see it .
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just that architecture is almost disappearing .
when these points fall down , you can write on it , you can write patterns , images , text , text .
our cities have been tested in the last few years with networks and electronics and electronics .
for bonobos and people are equally similar to life , life is not teeth and claws alone .

the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view that the fish knows .
and this was an example of which our own governments use the technology against us , the citizens .
we want to fight genomics and discrimination in the criminal justice system .
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually took .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
and what we actually did , we , the humanity , is we started to abstract .
this is because the government is further like an ocean , and that &apos;s the top 15-foot cart .
at the end of one day , i cook a huge top soup that we shared .
something as deep as our identity is now a question of choice as this slide is supposed to show .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , so long as you &apos;re not a particle physicist .
either &quot; flesh &quot; or &quot; a &quot; paradise , &quot; you will have the choice .
you can &apos;t just emphasize enough how critical this factor of life can be to the quality of a human .
by shaking the sidewalk , and it can make the characters interact with each other .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no man in their treatment .
i came up with it like we were going to send our echoes and cameras to dream .
how can we keep them more fresh -- better fresh , fresh , fresh , three-times fresh .
and the side of the nightless genes , which are the vilirious hormones .
i was the second volunteer at the top , so i had good opportunities to be able to get into it .

understand , there are two countries that control almost seven percent of the phosphorus phosphorus in the world .
in china , a neighbor is called a mid-honeyed today , like , yes , right ?
it took some years to start with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .

because obviously a animal that was very often very often , rarely before it dies .

they &apos;re not fighting this battle that we &apos;re all fighting to talk about who &apos;s going to speak ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
you may think that this is just a landscape , and the lower part was manipulated .
and the next piece of this is four women in three generations who are building a new life together .
the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is , but you know what ?
just to give you the overview , i zoom in to see what you get .
and as part of it , they made us a concept of anatomical negotiations .
or are we defined something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
i really hope that we &apos;re playing together with major games to survive on this planet another century .
it &apos;s absolutely astonishing cold and seventing ourselves that can afford to afford .
we are at a point where we don &apos;t have the same ratio to progress in the same way .
the idea of this is obviously not only , the machine agencies in the control room .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- i &apos;m really looking out of the socks .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with winds ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .

it sounds very space-time , and it sounds like science fiction , i know .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .

now , in some flat lakes in alaska lakes in alaska methane , from the water .
for them , the life of their life had a job : the tide of their family and a new life in australia .
and in reality , when we fail , when we get to obstacles , we often feel different .
to these archaarchical models , we heard that we have a very natural relationship to virtual disabilities .
when i was a kid , i had collected collections of constraints , a stresses and mutiles .
and so , from the interest of this , at this technology , i just moved there .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed an eight-screen package that &apos;s liquid in spaceship temperature .
unfortunately , not in openness , but maybe you can help the fear of france a little bit .
in high school , a student said that brian goldman was going to learn a blueprint .
i &apos;m going to point to a statistics that i hope most of you have heard .
so when we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and as many people , i thought it was mostly about choosing people in a ambassador .
so it &apos;s all the tools there , and the only thing that mimics us is our imagination .
if someone asked them to describe their brand identity , their brand personality , how would they be ?
so basically , if you look at something that &apos;s impossible , it &apos;s impossible to do it .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let it go .
and maybe we only know what wood we &apos;re protected when we &apos;re really going to be examined .
a third phrase , the immediately appeared to people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
this is what you call an initial law or an ancient psychology that affects us in the perception of perception .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re sitting next to the ownership as an old age .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtual disability as a real life space .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
i can accelerate the whole sequence by accelerating the tempo into the one or another .
so this question was so tangible that we decided to answer the answer of the answer and rigid developed .
we say , &quot; computer , generic , please take a hundred million randomized sequences of instructions .
make the methods that are easy to use , and start with these patients , in the team of poor people .
and i think the most important point is that we &apos;ve heard about talking to our patients .
so we might sell a shoe , and he will have the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever carried ...
why not have the fast muscle fibers that will allow them to be able to run faster and faster ?
we know that we work as human beings as a human being , when we work hard , significant work .
we know from this study that you have to go to the needle if it &apos;s to go to the thing .
i gave you an example of the north american tribe of nootonia .
maybe to be an aging understanding about the relationship between people and mystery of the creative experience .
we now have almost an infinite choice of telephones , especially in the mobile world of mobile phones .
but let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century so that we can predict the development .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privileged privileged , edible , consultancy .
so we could do the world very simple with dumb , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
when i went back 27 years later , the fish was shrink on the size of its size .
well , morgan , in the name of transparency , what &apos;s happening right now with the $ 7100 ?
it &apos;s nearly physiologically impossible to be bad aunt if you wear light bulbs .
do we use these decisions to form a society that &apos;s better , the successful , the friendly ?
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your neighbors ?
this also shows the underlying value of this talk , so i hope i &apos;m going to get hatred it .
but in fact , my research at the institute of the future is exactly the opposite .
there &apos;s nothing going on in my era or coming out , no trickle . and you can study everything .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics that were crazy to me were no fancy at all .
you can see it &apos;s a kind of mammals , often known as &quot; migration reactor . &quot;
i remembered myself last year when i brought mosquitos and somehow liked people .
for the old age , most of the time , they have the first semester , the great laws .
40 percent of people in the world get half of their drinking water from this melting water .
this is great . the tube didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
the viral particles were released by the cells , and they came back and killed . coli .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we have adapted this point for a long time to make our choice better .
well , you &apos;re looking at all cases , no one has to be an excellent candidate .
most of the mass incarceration in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of violent crime .
this reference to be suggested to invest the money in more security scores and security .
police officer came up with a dedicated statement of state and bureaucracy .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could have ever written by hand .
so for me , photography seemed more about going on at the right place at the right time .
and this sadness really formed in a thought , which is that i just want to wish one thing .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been for 500 years , as i &apos;ve got to say , very successful leadership .
you don &apos;t sit around , and you flip around . there &apos;s always some important thing to do .
our memory tells us stories that means what we need to keep from our experience is a story .
do you say there are negative effects to do with the clouds that are different ?
this is the deadline that shows us the environmental models that we need to hold .
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some parts .
you have committed to me that they &apos;re not taught . in fact , they &apos;re not going to leave the glass .
so many people come and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
she heard about this book of charles darwin , the origins of species and the retribal of the people .
so i explained my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , oma , i &apos;m going to do this . &quot;
evolution is all about the genomes of the genome on the next generation , adaptation and generation survival .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my physician therapy .
well , if i had ever opened up with the 600 images in it , i would have spent another hour of an hour .
people are going to believe in their faith , and that &apos;s how you can &apos;t free them .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design shop .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor , which seems to be difficult , but maybe the ones that we &apos;re talking about .
here we &apos;re going to see this again , again , again , the whole , individual aggregated .
review : now i &apos;m sort of interacting with the object , can zoom out again , zoom in .
now , first of all , is banal , but it &apos;s very exciting when you get closer to it .
because , often , people can &apos;t make it friendly so everybody can deal with it .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of rabbit and bogger .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace this , it will be a huge challenge .
if you break the goldglass glass glass so that everything is possible , it sends the satisfaction .
if i live in a room -- like now , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking about me .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to court and wear this crazy case .
recently , a study was done with ceos in which they saw the ceos for a week .
so we overwhelmed our brains , because our brain is very simple , it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
i got another gift to see in the future , and to come back and live differently .
that means we have a common ancestor , a evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
so we have the memory itself and the life itself , and they &apos;re really quite different .
unfortunately , that &apos;s the whole good news , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;re often mentioned .
i mean , every one of us here could change five times as much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i only got two years later when we moved to california .
so , you need to follow the learning process of music language at least as much as the spoken word language .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put these little pieces together and correct the mistakes .
we &apos;ve done it on about a hundred genes of the 500 or so that are here .
and this really reaches these ideas to create these limitations for the available place on the screen .
and it &apos;s decent to think that our species may have existed for 600,000 years .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us extinct .
we developed an app for layar , extended reality to find these aeds .
and by the way , there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m going to tell you about , which works on the wireless .
we use this great euphemism , attempt and error , which turns out to be meaningful .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the start .
so if you &apos;re lucky enough to maximize both of the self , you &apos;re going to end up doing very different things .
like peter peter told us not only did the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a correct record .
we hope that this is not a pop-ups and other nonsense -- that &apos;s not supposed to be necessary .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather didn &apos;t fear before the arctic night or the end of the race storm .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones have been produced -- 75 or 75 stones on this planet .
and to win , the device needs a better diagnosis than a team of highly qualified doctors .
the founding fathers were from my view of the original atomic activists , and that &apos;s why .
they were playing a worker game , and they were able to break down the victims of a episode adventure .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are successes of scientific method .
that would have been without the reverse space , but the power is so much more important .
certainly i would never achieve an alien world with a spacecraft , which seemed rather unlikely to me .
we &apos;re not going to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen in the moment .
all right , just to close , i want to realize that i talked a lot about the fathers .
who knows when the movie comes out , maybe we &apos;ll see a horror volcano .
what are we going to start with the fact that we &apos;re only different from them through nucleus ?
it feels like what i want to do , where i want to go and raise my strength and permanent .
but when you &apos;re in a episode adventure , and you say , &quot; we &apos;re going to get the oil out of it . &quot;
because if we could figure this out , we would never have never known as human potential for the potential .
and that &apos;s going to be worse , and pretty soon kids will die again , because that &apos;s just one question of numbers .
in the rich world , the millions of millions of us have only threatened a generation , hardly .
here we see a very fundamental service . is there at home so that you can read the homework ?
the greeks called these diets of diets of creativity .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see you in the next century .
and we &apos;re installing a evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going on in the micro-scale area .
so in other words , the future of every year is a year shrink since i was on this world .
they shoot the decision -- they shoot them , even if they &apos;re interested in their own best interest .
so to do things like this -- you know , people remember -- this is kind of a bit of why we &apos;re interested in .
if you surround yourself to the right people , you won &apos;t just understand it , you &apos;ll also appreciate it .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said they were doing this model .
one method that &apos;s particularly interesting , and what i used in the last time is evolution itself .
we had a team of rock fellows in boston in boston to program the code for programming .
so , imagine if you were at the same time of several places , how would that feel ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
so the neurons are the information processing workers who have built these cell communities .
so , it was possible for us to connect the little digital jumps with the torture of a torture .
eeaceacea , a little antioxidancing , which helps them to jump on the jump .
no , the gap that i &apos;m talking about has to do with it , that they are disappointing themselves .
when professors become curiosity , they often shrink into such research semester .
this is what &apos;s happening in the machine age , and it &apos;s happening to the book , and it &apos;s the olimastergraphy .
and it &apos;s about solving a game , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first ones that are going to be the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s in about 18 months .
it turns out that it was really important in reality , &quot; we want to do nothing with your film . &quot;
in the moment , it was like a film director would have landed a boost change .
that &apos;s the way i would say , shake your child , just three times more than five times .
and the main lesson that we think we &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
but there &apos;s no one that we can look around where you learn how to do fire .
be to write the piece of writing , will always be more and more to my personal , to play it .
but these concepts of cyberage that bring us back to these possibilities back to our skills .
so these ngos were going to survive longer , and they were paying themselves in larger exaggeration .
and so just that kind of words that we use in the language of political correct speech are used to use .
the first example requires what many of you know and some of you appreciate , very few of them don &apos;t need at all .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor says to them , we could do a , or we could do b b .
i want to explain to you with this mechanism today or make something that &apos;s unfamiliar with you .
so now , i &apos;m one of my favorite images of my favorite , serious worker worker of hemisphere in the face .
but now , when you get the evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
for example , in openness , for example , households are 20 percent of the trash between wind .
but again and again , very rarely , something special happened . one of the representations was actually overwhelmed in the world .
my heart remained to me was shame while i was trying to touch what was in front of me .
the human part of this book , far the end of it , is , of course , what we &apos;re interested in most .
immediately , you &apos;re going to have one , for those of you who are predicted these predictions , you can &apos;t prove it .
they reformed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that will be changed at a moment of biology .
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re taking away from your mind . how can you be harmful ?
for these non-engineers , little-life material became another material , electronics was just another material .
so what can happen three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of human community ?
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that indish is indish , but also very congestion .
and every time it was divided , the funds are distributed to spread the same amounts of chemicals .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow an realistic outcome .
so i wanted to create something else , something that begins in the process when the trigger is expressed .
and if you take a picture of a camera , you end up with a camera , the process , if you put it on the output .
yet my interest in photography when i received my first digital camera camera , at the age of 15 years .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , these black object that you see .
i don &apos;t want this thing to be broken in 20 parts of how to know it from documentary documents .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of my life doing this , trying to be myself , and at the same time .
but not only that -- so that &apos;s melting and connected to the universe and other devices out there .
three billion hours a week is not close enough to solve the most important problems of the world .
there are so controversial things like this whole intelligent crops on the beckles .
if any one of the two inches would have made a high construction , he would have contributed the price at home .
i met mr in 2008 , two years ago , in walt disney hall .
and yes , the discussion always goes around the question of how far you can take a piece of the future .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus who really have to go back to circles .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated when i was going to be the underground .
they can go and create their own museum online -- from all these images , they can put their own collection .
so , in large and all of us , we &apos;re very confident that we actually determined what the goal is .
well , a lighting is used to be used to something that you find because you &apos;re going to fall somewhere .
so the idea is that we actually include people with them , in which they do things , collective .
at home in new york , i &apos;m chef of the development department of a nonprofit organization called rorobin .
it &apos;s like satisfaction or the person is happy when they think about their lives .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and stay here .
they lie , they shrink , they &apos;re confused , and they &apos;re really really drought .
because the ground is going to die down the moose , and the wind and the water drives the soil .
so , as a citizen , you &apos;re replaced as citizens , you &apos;re just going to sit down with these scientific technologies .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another explanation of what you see in the same way .
this is one of the images that we &apos;ve been seeing with what &apos;s called the gapeg technology .
now , since the film , in the sundus film festival , we can look at this .
and every time i interviewed someone , i can say , &quot; are you happy enough for this interview ?
ice mountains are born as calories of a gglacier or break out of ice sheets .
so in this project , we actually designed some little marker to track the garbage as it goes through the system .
our language hints the social changes that have been solved in many cases by a technological change .
but danny , in the entire american quest , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
i know we can , and as far as it is me , what the world needs now .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccine for the new yorker , a little article .
so the performance is to work with prototypes -- but let &apos;s see how different teams are different .
and , although it really seems to be simple , it &apos;s actually really hard to do it , because people think very quickly .
there are very , very few things you can even say , of which there &apos;s a chance in a million .
and i noticed , like this very deep sixth , a world-like mission mission .
that was the movement . it was the legal achievement . it was the business plan of the american agriculture .
if i come , with my little dev , and i &apos;m just dancing , this feeling comes on .
there &apos;s an old african spell saying , &quot; if you &apos;re going to be quick , gear alone .
we made little pieces , made a error correction and had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
they found a paper with false thought , they could feel the urge of these thoughts .
they live in a world that has information and communication in flow , like nobody ever could have predicted .
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , oma . i promise it . &quot;
i &apos;ve been trying to make it clear how valuable cities are to how much valuable they are than they cost .
and it seemed to be preferred with these gray boxes , this real-time control systems .
and you &apos;re going to offer you all the nutrients that you could only want to do without any effort .
if you have a mind about these qualities , we can create a new reality and create new approaches .
perhaps that &apos;s exactly the sense of widendrill , a perception of icons , a sense of our own power .
the challenge offers a shared experience , a shared language , basic posture to build the right prototype .
if you have 10 teams , the typical precaution , you get about six , the stable structures .
and there &apos;s certainly unclear about how bad these are going to follow , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .

to give this conversation a sense of purpose , of course , i had to know something about this remarkable belief in doubt of doun and voodoo is not a cult of the black magic .
and because there &apos;s nothing more important than our survival , the first test for all the information is part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i received most of the feedback or where i had the biggest success , these are where i interact with things directly .
now , i don &apos;t want you to use too much time to imagine the creation , because if you imagine all the time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
you have to separate two things : to be a medical fact , to be a medical fact , amputed and to the other social opinion , whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
the idea of this company was to overcome the phase phase of analogous processes with optical printing and start to start with digital productions .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to have the user data about a usb -- like we &apos;ve seen it at stuxy .
and in this way , time is actually the critic variable that distinguishes a memory of self from a living self . even a very little impact on this story .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and when that &apos;s how people do it , people also make mistakes of time .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure from their blood pressure , send it to their doctor , and to share it with others for more than 100 dollars .
so the first case : all the trillion religions of atoms that come out of the piece of metal , and at the same time , the same atoms are moving at the same time and down .
when i think about creating flow , i don &apos;t mean a lifetime of luxury on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of possibilities .
but the latest dna evidence shows that the etrusker , who later trained the tube , the same dna as the old lyrics .
how to increase happiness is very different depends on how they think , and whether they think about the memory itself or whether they think about life itself .
but if you &apos;ve got very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a male -- the one they dig , without the whole complex .
we &apos;re going to turn it off , and we expect the first data in june or juli to collect , and put our journey around what the building blocks of the universe are .
we want to encourage the world of creation , the inventor , the encouragement , because this world where we live in , these interactive world .
imagine this device in the middle of a developing country , where there &apos;s no doctors , but 25 percent of the burden of disease and 1.3 percent of health workers in health care .
so one day i decided to visit the filiters , and i asked the head , &quot; does this model work that people really offer all these possibilities ? &quot;
the director of congress came up and said , &quot; professor romer , i thank you for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
we have to do these conversations , and we have to think , but if we go to the time machine and go to the future , we will be glad to do that .
so again , i was standing with a little team on unknown terrain , and we drew &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that was not yet before .
and then we don &apos;t have this one , but that &apos;s what i think is , you know , i think it &apos;s pretty good for people who are right there .
i mean , it can be weird about thinking that a thing is at the same time in two different places , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea , they developed them .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes us from a &quot; uh &quot; -- to a &quot; ta-moment . &quot;
but the measurements are very beautiful , and people in my company told me that we &apos;re not able to be able to do that .
i was seven , when i went back to one of his classes , and i played the last four balins of chopin , a late piece of work .
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at everything for you , everyone knew you had this physical genius that helped you .
on nine people that we have executed , one that we have for innocent debt that was disappointed and made out of death cell .
so an organism could learn , for example , a certain fruit could not eat , because it was bad , and made him sick , the last time he ate them .
personally , i think it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to go with the ideas in your head .
it &apos;s about how you encounter people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media , and so they can create a peaceful experience .
finally , this older black man came with a very worried facial expressions in the courtyard and sat behind me , almost on the defense bank .
there &apos;s this plane made out of hundreds of thousands of pieces that work together to make their secrecy . &apos; don &apos;t make you look at that ? &quot;
one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in , &quot; exploded in my garbage . can &apos;t say if she &apos;s dead .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults , met me , she turned to me , she turned into a box full and was put in my hands .
we &apos;re going to have a process where maybe 100,000 years of rule , and we can compress it on a thousand years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years .
there &apos;s a series of people who have much more &quot; uh , &quot; oh , moments as others , and under the worst beds are frozen winners .
that means we &apos;re looking at our proposal before we see it back to our back in the back of our soul , to say , okay .
his job is to create the conditions that exist less than a billionth of the universe at the beginning of the universe -- and to 600 million times a second .
but you also preserve a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to more and challenges , through greater creativity and print surgery .
and a lot of discussions that i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion i had in the last three years of photovoltaics .
a season who , if you have the power of water , it has enough pressure , so i think , it &apos;s four to six searchable bar .
and what happened to me was something interesting . which was what i was interested in jacques cousteal of sentiments , which was thought of a completely unknown world here on our earth itself .
and our european connected network is basically just made out of louder rows of large power plants , wherever the wave is all around europe .
one process that -- as everyone knows , who &apos;s ever tried to do something -- so in other words , in fact , everybody here -- doesn &apos;t always keep any reasonable .
and every year we ask the students to create business , products and services that are positioned within a decade of millennia , the lives of millennia can flourish people .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral penalty of the universe is far more affordable , but that it enters justice .
and finally , saturday : a very unique style , personal style , is a great way to tell the world about something without saying a word .
they were not counting , because he was stayed with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had gotten to keep .
i think the molecular biology is now in general , as i &apos;m talking about , biotechnology , everything you &apos;re counting , synthetic biology and so on .
how about this , the oppression where they &apos;re always to give a voice to make attention and change , for the first time , for the first time ?
i love to find any opportunity to find a different colorful , crazy output , to wear , and in the last time , to photograph and bloggers .
i &apos;ve always told my wife , whenever a human being in a moral justifiction , because we should try to replace it by literally replacing it .
and it turns out that if you make it a little bit more concrete , it feels a very good tool to save people to save more .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people we love to preserve in front of sales , but they also pretend to deal with it well .
so we take something very complicated , turn it into sound , a sequence of sounds , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
no , it just looks a lot better if we show that we are constantly willing to move the risks that others do when they put fire .
now , in egypt , the record of april in april 2011 , the key of the egypt secrets of egyptian police , and they found a lot of actors .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of programming work , numerous parties and created , tony records for the first time after seven years .
so this is what was a problem for these reactors , which is what we fill in our garbage , and so that &apos;s going to reduce the garbage wire dramatically reduced during this process .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we have digital biology , and now we &apos;re trying to create the digital code in a new phase of biology by creating new life and building .
but this is what keeps me at night -- one of the things that keep me wake at night , and we &apos;ve never had scientific progress in the way that we &apos;ve never needed , as far as we have , right now .
so , according to burns , the premities in january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls from this film .
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate at the moment , at the end of the coordination force , because we don &apos;t have any other or storm bines , because it &apos;s not going to go .
a lot of our friends thought that we &apos;re pretty stupid to do that , and that we &apos;re going to go back and grab all the pictures of the walls would be more gray .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of passive , which is many of my colleagues , but is total nonsense .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government who pay taxes and services .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university at stanford , i went to this very , very exclusive likelihood of life at the time , at least he was really smart .
in a country that has just been behind a prophecy crisis , where congress was voted to change this change with 124 voice .
it seems like we were quite remote from the other parts of life , but in fact , the biggest part , the basic mechanisms of our cells are pretty much the same .
but the logic of deception allows us to do that as the first set of preferences would be wrong as if you had to think of the opposite without evidence .
it &apos;s always a very happy concern when i have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been working for as long as i &apos;ve seen how new experience .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up to my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing , you &apos;re talking like that . &quot;
well , there are marks and eighty marks , these things that come and go , but a contract , marke marke is a pretty strong thing .
and if you &apos;ve got to say that the drug is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the user data is a science for itself .
if i tell you that someone has given his life as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self .
now , i started with a couple of people in the company . no one could give me a decent answer , until i finally started the biologists .
basically , you get any round of reralities on each other randomly randomly , and while you &apos;re trying to form words , these are going to be examined about a dictionary .
let &apos;s move back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot of well-being , or maybe a little bit less likely to talk to you about it .
but then another thing happened , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and that began to communicate these cells and share information so that communities came from cells .
and what happens is , if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference , we say , in climate .
they &apos;re staring out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see is fluid and these poems , dense margins .
we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these design components of the future .
ladies and gentlemen , which gives me enormous trust in our future , is the fact that we have more power today than individuals to put us the great challenges of our planet .
so a app that &apos;s written in a couple of days , and then it &apos;s spread from rare , is a kind of sharp of the bug on the institution .
what that means is that if you would meet somebody , and you would tell them , oh , his father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about your size ?
at this point and if you laugh , you can see how important this gap is , and how much time you need to experience something that &apos;s very good for us to share with .
how it would feel like to live in a world where the german state left people , especially when there were no proportion of youth .
and because the government ultimately drives their strength out of us -- remember , &quot; we &apos;re thinking about the people ? &quot; -- how do we think about how this change happens .
are they reliable , stable , stable , org , safe , sacred , holy , and how the dalai lama or yoda ?
this is ayahuasca , which many of you heard about , the most powerful psychoactive cerebral parat from the repertoire of the shadow .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with sexual people whose gender atypical -- so people who are not the average male or female types .
that &apos;s what we had to do at the time . if we took kids as a book laser , we took the description of the machine and proposed them on the wall in our heads .
we came to talk about music . and a few days later , i got an email that nathaniel was interested in education in me .
and we &apos;re going to give ourselves the medieval campus for example , the virtual reality in our v.r. lab lab , and we can actually do this all the time .
i said , &quot; well , you know , you know , and i know both when this book is not brillant that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ? &quot;
because it &apos;s just as much meaning as anything that i heard about when it was about explaining the absolutely crazy process of the creative process .
so it &apos;s so far . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that was ever taken 27 -- 27 miles across the diameter .
and i &apos;ve argued that we may be able to create a new form of cambrew explosion in which there might be new massive education based on this digital design .
the reason is that it used to be better than everything was bad when everything was bad , it was possible for people to make experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
and i used to talk to myself that if i double my efforts to perfection , and never again have a mistake that the voice could cause the voice .
so these are just a couple of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but they could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i wanted several months to plan them to find the different places for the pieces of the les .
but also , because it turns out that we use this whole time to actually change what we &apos;re doing as people are able to do .
now , i can tell you the claim of the bach that the bach in the modern wing for the modern wing , which can &apos;t make a baroo balcono .
already from german germans to english , it can require more knowledge , even if you can distort it , or even at poetry .
bg : now we need one of these scaling , generating things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then use 20 years .
if you &apos;re playing , you see some nuances here that are zoomed up to the top , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows are surprising .
you have to imagine that , if you do something of the classic soundscape , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , just an hour .
i &apos;m a wall . to work on work every day , i have to stand up at the same time and switching me and really unpleasant .
so they found , according to herherotus , the worker game and agreed a national strategy , and at a day you would eat . the next day you would play .
the other note says whether we &apos;re using the zero-sum emissions , whether it &apos;s in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
i sold this as a &quot; romeo and julia ship on a ship , &quot; it became a film of episodes , a passionate film .
now , in discussions , this insulin is trying to do this insulin that has a small web that has a small web that has to do with our relationship and nothing .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a grave in berlin where we can actually form the electric proportion of the island at the stage three .
that means that the interpret has to translate this unbelievable disabled language in a different language , which is a different audible , concrete , nonverbal language .
and the intuitive user is not just an elementary factor since apple has been an elementary factor , elementary success factor , if i just want to use technological devices in humans .
a lot of journalists called me to ask me , &quot; what are you going to do , what are you going to do , whether caster seya or is male ? &quot;
now , what i hear is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing that is wrong .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them to play together some kind of game , to control their health better .
and think of yourself , i &apos;ve even been a five-year-old child with dr. p.p. and so trying to stop these practices , natural success without success .
bg : well , the actual spending for research -- say , we should spend the u.s. 10 billion a year more than they &apos;re doing today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore and interact , and the unexpected link that we form , are the real nutrition of creativity .
and since there was no video games nor this transmission with computer generated movies , the whole language of media landscape in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
so , as you knew in the village , who &apos;s got what &apos;s going on with wine and when this is happening today about this extension of our own self-assembling devices on global level .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility so that i could do that , and so i would be able to worry about my patients without contact with him .
i got a fine box , because i &apos;m not on the bike , but often there &apos;s a disabled disability to drive on the bike .
and so i look at as one of the people in common with the most experimental antennae that need a good logic to add the complex ideas .
if we look at one of the founders of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream &quot; a kind of solution .
jacques cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating attitude , the animals and places and a world full of wonder that we could never imagine before .
and when it comes to us , of course , to us , for nike , for nike and mauritz and the whole textile industry .
in every step , we created these pieces in the overhead so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process of what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
in other words , in the course of the 20th century , the sharing of the community is to become our part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or doing something new .
my wife , my kids , and i moved to the garage , and these hacker and programmers and writers and writers and archives made our house .
we can go out a step further and see the data then and see that circular disease and cancer is the usual suspect , but not for everyone .
90 percent of the big fish we love , the tunas , the thresses , the lake buds , the chiefs , heavy fish , they &apos;re broken together .
over the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has doubled more than doubling , which has triggered average income in the average income of the world population .
one of the areas that we see this to the contribution , in our culture today , in today &apos;s culture , are the fighting over the beginning and the end of life .
well , that &apos;s good , apart from that paul walks around and talks about vaccines and says how valuable they are , and that people should just stop talking to jamie .
the second one is a conviction of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s between your life and happiness and his life , or happy with his life .
you go to this capsule , you fall in these dark , hostile environment , where no hope rescue is on rescue if you don &apos;t make it back itself .
so , you also realize that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only from that absence to the idea , the idea of doing a hundred percent renewable .
it was detected in the cell , and it recognized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and so we had only one cell at the end with a new chromosome .
and these scientists have just documented the different themes with which these ceo is busy , and how much time they make decisions that are related to the issues .
all of you think i was in &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have been sleeping somewhere on a wet on a palm on the beach .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this love story , like romantic , is also important .
my first memories are from this boat -- the steal virtues of the motors , the clapping of every wave on the bug , the range and loud horizon .
and if you manipulate the speed of this novel , you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor into the rotor , and finally , to explode the centrifuge .
it &apos;s the life itself , the doctor &apos;s primarily -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; is it now , if i grab you here ? &quot;
now , when we go on and go to age , we say 40 years or younger , we see that even the main cause is about the people who need to worry about .
we should call them what it is , a gear in recovery , a commercial capital , risky capital that enables them .
we can see if we can use storage co2 that could just be brought into productivity , condense co2 into fuel , to drive this process .
so when i started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
if people would take that seriously , i mean , it seems to make everything on the head , everything we think , for example , in terms of policies and so on .
it depends a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two columns , and the one is to promote the opposite of the first sentence and predict .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the creator and the design design -- what we did was we actually founded the company -- we started to get too slowly .
it looks something like this , who has no freedom of freedom , can &apos;t be moved for his actions and claims to responsibility , and it &apos;s so unsustainable .
since i &apos;m going to have more life vehicles than today , and that &apos;s why my palette of music sounds even more than much more nuances , more nuances and emotions than today .
it &apos;s also a artistic aspect of biology and biological materials , yes , electronics like electronics , and combines that in a pretty small way .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of deep sea , even in the flat oceans , is so fascinating in the way that we can &apos;t really imagine it .
and then the size of the semantic connection and the feet , which is really , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic network effect .
i &apos;ve recently done a question with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions , which is a typical person on a day of 70 .
a couple of weeks later , the firewage gave a letter to the homeownership where they used to rescue for the rescue of their homework .
the food that had to be coined by a chef or a coin or a coat must be eaten , and not only eat or receptor .
they should talk about these innovation strategy , and they would be smiled by the ridiculous ones that will be spent for these innovative heritage tools .
and if you want to go over 20 , three percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , then you have to turn off the el .
and then we put a d.d burning burning , and we put the burning out of the laser , and then we tried to focus on this camera .
now , of course , the chance of right-wing instructions is very small that they &apos;re carried by random animals , so they &apos;re not going to make any of the instructions .
that means , instead of remembering individually , we have standardized , common in mapping of memories that we can depend our personal memories .
and yet , the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology that you see here , everything .
and that &apos;s what i sent them home , i mixed a quiet voice in me trying to tell me , &quot; goldman , goldman , no good idea . that &apos;s not . &quot;
what do you think about the average performance for a cardiologist or a nurse or a nurthope , a birthday , a rescue store ?
this is a people who are not cognitively different between the color and green is different , and there &apos;s the hike of the forest where people are depending on the people .
and my love to science fiction appeared in my surroundings , because then , in the late &apos; 60s , we went to the moon and explored the deep sea .
we see a lot of gigabytes of digital photos here that you &apos;re going to go forward and continue to remove while you &apos;re going to be able to rearrange , in any way .
this tribe , the coke , 17 varieties of ayan ahuaca , which you see all at large distance in the forest in the forest that appear for our eyes as a kind of thing .
and i was confused , because i thought , the whole concept , the idea of advertising your product as many people as possible to present it as many people as possible .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing that you have in front of each other is because you have a job of a problem that you can explain to you .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have traveled to this distance of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not even away .
that our system also has a price increase , is that we &apos;re doing 20 percent with el and also a price on the other things that others don &apos;t beat .
we &apos;ve only been using phosphorus for two years , and now we &apos;re now being used by phosphorus mining around the world a lot more uranium in the environment than in all atoms .
we propose that in 10 years , the federal recognition of the civil liberation is going to be as high as the election of the election .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up with the internet , and the knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the systems right .
and so far the isolation is that , if we shrink as a species planet , there will be isolation and change the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science . but i &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to think you &apos;re going to have to do a director , a leader like a shipping apple or something .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species and converted into a new species based on the new software that we gave in the cell .
well , i hope that you agree with me that people are human resources that we can use in real life in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
now all of these randomized instructions , leaders , all programs from programs , chosen and close-up people who are the next one . &quot;
these are two very different units , the life itself , and the memory itself , and the two to change is part of the process of happiness .
if this device sequenced , or dna virus , it &apos;s not known , it &apos;s called the health authorities and prevent a pandemic from her outbreak .
well , if you buy it , people would buy six times more of a glass brand , which they had six choices when they had 24 .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at a point when there was a break , octavio , said , &quot; paul , we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
but for two weeks , we &apos;ve programmed , we went to the street in venice , my kids were raised , my dog , my dog and we created this .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the ancient greek historic historian herotus , you might know this story . the story of how and why games were invented .
but i think in this frame here and with the intention of making something bad , i &apos;m just going to leave the needle in there and go from the stage .
and from my view , the scientific method is trying to figure out if it works , if it doesn &apos;t do that , one of the greatest achievement of humanity .
a lot of arguments about it . fishing pollutants the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big part .
and because they work much harder than we do , and it &apos;s only three to six months , they &apos;re talking in their weight , in energy consumption , a little bit three billion people .
so , if you take the system like i was taught , and all the eradicated health workers , then the end of the system is no longer left .
i think the remarkable values of the last years , the last decade , is that we are constrained by a physical world of a digital world .
so gender is really complicated ; interfaces are not just standing in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a certain way , can be distributed across the entire bandwidth .
and by the way , we migrate and circular , and we mix so much longer that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for evolution to find evolution .
of course , the stories that i was looking for , from the scienticity of science , &quot; terminator , &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
and in this scenario , they imagine that in a case the sperm of a chomosom that &apos;s going on the x chromosome .
not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive people &apos;s ability to survive and to survive flows from the human spirit is determined by conflict .
and then i went to berlin years after berlin , because i wanted to do renewable energy , and that was not in karlslsses .
they believed that creativity was a kind of divine spirit that came from a distance , unknown source to people -- unknown , unknown , unknown .
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for people like them and me , if they think about it , don &apos;t make sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
armstrong twitter was talking about us and then , in december , has taught us the metic magazine than one of the best inventors in 2010 , which was really class .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people use things that we design .
they were the notion that people who had political power should have had this political power , because of the bloodline of the grandfather of grandfather to father and so on .
i &apos;ve counted some people &apos;s number of books that were published with &quot; in the last five years , &quot; in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 , and there was a lot more .
she came from a man , a afro-american , sympathy , rau , homeless who played on a mental illness that only had two seasons .
and i went back to the same torture of shame and self-doubt , felt myself and went to work until the work came back and again and again .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not welcome to the truth of truth and reconciliation .
it &apos;s so that these connections , your connections with all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the profound and strange mechanics of quantum mechanics .
wireless optimism is the desire to do something immediately , to do a frozen , with the belief that we have a founded hope for hope .
well , very briefly , another reason that we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .

if you allow someone to activate your own inner forces , the human mind is so recommended -- if you &apos;re willing to do that , and open it for somebody in a key moment , then they &apos;re a very good teacher .

now , when i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of them are government officials . some of science come from science . some , some of them come out of the economy . here &apos;s my chef . and one of the music comes from the music .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been working for a couple of years now with the biohack , and that &apos;s what i just started to do , because i just wanted to know , and i wanted to do it in front of all the way that i learned in order to theoretical theoretically .
and i left the medical school with the impression that i knew everything i knew and knew everything as much as possible , as possible as possible as possible as possible , that i &apos;m going to be able to do with the imperative of error .
and then , if i go a step further into this user interface , where i go from voice , by language , by language , by hand , and no longer by mouse and cursor , i have to control things faster , and i &apos;m even more immediate .
that is , i &apos;ve actually hire them now to be in front of them that they don &apos;t recognize any other pattern in there , but i &apos;ve condensed them within a long time , and again , again , again , in this dog , to see the picture .
in the moment , where i turn my hand away from them , so that you see from the back , this fingers , my fingers , just from there , where he was , in a position where he &apos;s so extinct .
not to burn the enlightenment a little bit better to burn it and to put it in the fuel facilities for circles for circles , but first time , how do you make circles ?
the first thing that i saw was this idea that their brand personality separation has two separate beds , but the mortal pages -- the morgan lobe is a remarkable march .
in other ways , like the fertility of fertilizers , 105 : 55 : 564 , linking : 05 : 55 : 5855 or air traffic or air traffic , the room is much smaller .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is when i put things old , i can redesign them like the right side , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salz and pz , or i can make them intuitively intuitively intuitively intuitively intuitively designing things .
because this is what it turns out , if you offer a placebo in a white mushroom , in a form of a pile tablet , it &apos;s just a predator , white mushroom that has a specific effect that has a certain effect .
the coding evolution of industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a waste of electricity in the waste of electricity , and therefore we have refrigerators , air conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
we turned out the light , we put it in a vacuum and cleaned the whole air out of the air and cooled it all the way back to the time alone , was the metal piece of metal , all the way to act .

together , the unprecedented cultures in the world are a net of spiritual and cultural life that surrounds the earth , and probably as important as the earth is , as the biological food web you know as a biosphere .

some bacteria have figured out how to stay away from penicillin remote , and have written these information together with other bacteria in dna , and now we have lots of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because the bacteria communicate each other .

now let me introduce you to election , which is going to be carbonate by amboxeton , 19 years ago , a spinal cord injury , which has been the result that they couldn &apos;t run anymore and 19 years since now .

and dr. kean said to him , he said , &quot; i learned that children , if they don &apos;t always get anything else , and even when they get a little bit of support , if you get a little support of your children , then you can get a lot of kids . &quot;
if we go to these very large bridges -- with over 100,000 base pairs -- they &apos;re not just going to grow into ecoli . coli : it &apos;s going to grow all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we &apos;re changing other mechanisms .
and i realized , at the same time , that it &apos;s okay to be an outsider , a neutral , new , new image -- and not just okay , but something that you have to be grateful , maybe a gift of the bow .
and so i think of the city of a very different view , a very different impression , which is i see negative and positive zones in a city and so on this way , a very different virtual map of a very real city .
but that &apos;s the most important thing that can happen , because this is the group of group that is forced to help patients , because the patient could be used against obesity , or it could get the patient &apos;s smooth .
as i said , i &apos;ve been giving myself over the years , in some pretty awful situations , but nothing could preparate me , nothing to do with me , anything that was so difficult and so dangerous and as dangerous as these guys go into a room .
and that &apos;s very amazing , because you actually think that this high-tech technology that you meet there is actually a place in the future , but in fact , it &apos;s the future that the future is right at us , with our archaic roots .
and because i was born without denial legs , and my feet were given to you , and i just had a few toes on this one , and a few toes on the other hand he had to get that stranger , that stranger had to get the bad news .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was talking about 20 years ago when i first told that i was a writer that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of anxiety reaction .
if we &apos;re in a game world , i believe that many of us turn into our best version , and at any time , we &apos;re ready to solve harnessing the problem as long as we need to try and try and try it again .
and i &apos;m just holding one of these little devices up because things are always supposed to be intuitive , natural , friendly , friendly friendly , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually for people , of course , what &apos;s friendly intuitive or intuitive .

they hook these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see behind the face or the figure , and they found nothing , and they concluded that this is the heartfelt cards of the heartbeat , and they were killing five mixes with the spears .
i &apos;ve always been willing to write my synthetic dictionary , but i was working with the texts of the texts , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never been in my life , which means &quot; disabled . &quot;
imagination is prisoner , and with this sentence , i &apos;d like to close to this sentence , and again , to the hint , designers need to think differently , to come up with new solutions , and in this sense , thank you very much for your attention and please .
and i definitely know that it would be for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous to catch this dark side of the suspect of the suspect -- especially in the surrounding me in my career .
the older black man stood up . he saw the deputy , and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come up with this young man to say this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal . don &apos;t give her eyes . &quot;
so , the problem of the cooperative online worlds like world warning is that it &apos;s so peaceful to be at the edge of a episode that we &apos;d rather spend our time in these worlds .
later on day i went to this basic piece with miguel , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems to be so different , &quot; as every farm i &apos;ve ever been on , &quot; how do you succeed ? &quot;
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic apps that had reached for three million years had the size of the underground 48 percent of the united states in order to ruin 40 percent .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles about philadelphia , baltimore , baltimore -- 50 to 60 percent of all boys are either young men in jail , in jail , in jail , in terms of discrimination .
according to this election , between the 21st and the 24th of february , a delegation of about 30 famines of the two places in the world , most interested in trying to increase the business of the city .

it enables us to tell the story of neuromarketing , as we tell the story in this film , that today you use mris to make the fungus of the brain , both advertising movies and films .

both in my profession at rof , as well as my volunteer as a volunteer man , i &apos;m a company of generosity and friendship and friendship in the big scale , but i also look at the closest of love and mumity of the individual .
suppose you live in a certain area , and you &apos;ve got a loaded person with heartened heart disease , and your hometown , you know , a cardiologist , whose average cardiac performance is in 200 .
but when i was talking to him , and he asked him why he did this intervention -- it was risky operations -- his answer was that his country , in his country , would be treated very bad , and therefore he had to do it .
and , of course , when it &apos;s an intuitive thing , and as i can take as an age of age of age , and just redesign the things that they design so that they use a user friendly , so they &apos;re intuitively intuitively intuitive , because they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re just fun to use .
it &apos;s a system where there are two fundamental positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t . those who are doing the bats and the limitations , and the limitations , without any limitation , the bad results and the good results with good outcomes .
it also has three big problems . the cost , mostly in high-regulated countries , and the question is , for security , you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human work , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid of fear is a real gas , and it keeps millions of people from bloom .
now , to decide not to buy a glass box is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our silence -- but it turns out that the decision-making problem is also affecting us in very consequence .
i don &apos;t have to admit that emotionally , because the corner is always going to be a different , crazy , colorful , deadline of the output , just waiting for me to wait if i have a little bit in the heart , and it &apos;s looking at it .
so this is one effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we make less peace with the outcome of choice than if we had the possibility of deciding less possibilities between us .
this is a photograph i took on the ngos of the baffin islands , when i went to the founder of whale al jagon , and this man , olina aya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the memory itself , and you can think of the memory itself as a way of thinking about the life itself , the alive itself is not using life itself .
i mean , if i &apos;m in the alone , i do all kinds of weird stuff , but then other people get up and i listen to all these things , because i don &apos;t want to belong with them , or frankly , they &apos;re going to disappear .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to make strips and less use , but in average , this number is going to increase every year , and so it &apos;s going to double more than doubling the number of services per person .
i met these people from gral , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to promote a light on every arbitrary surface , and then draw with a laser pointer , which is only registering the surface .
so what that means is , if we look back to what &apos;s going on in evolution , and how we think about the place of people in evolution , and especially in terms of evolution , we look at the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
so there &apos;s big challenges here . there are challenges in transmission . for example , if we say that the energy energy outside the country is outside the country , you don &apos;t only need the technology , you have to deal with the risk that the energy comes from where the energy comes from .
but , as we think , the only way we think about biology has a big impact without any cost of food on food costs or restrictions of their limitability , is when we see co2 as a co2 material , and therefore we &apos;re working on these cells .
i started working with scientific literature on how these centrifuges are built in natins , and found that they were structured in something called the cakaskage , and each kaskh cade 164 centrists .
now the fascinating thing is that the betaoline coins that are contains in the liane , mao inhibitors are exactly the way that they need to potentially have the trypoes . so they ask themselves .
this is a problem where global warming is given the frozen reason to look at the arctic ocean , where there are big amounts of frozen carbon , which is when it comes to mics from micromethane .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of the attack was actually slowly to get it slowly and unhealthier -- obviously , in trying to make engineers desperate despair , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get behind it quickly .
so perhaps germans of this technological change , because the reason that there was always a different truth , which is that every person in society can give something special and very powerful and very powerful that human ability to adapt to the human capacity .
my good friend ray shortly has shown us that every tool that &apos;s going to be the information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , makes it big law , and the price of prioritizing is all 12 to 24 months .
the first project we &apos;ve done as an international group when we &apos;ve been aware of ourselves , o.k , there &apos;s now as a scene , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people that are always there and so forth .

so what you got was this : your name is this : my tedtalk , which you have no idea what &apos;s going to be the subject , and the subject of the content is going to fly around the ears , especially if i &apos;m going to be involved in your company for your collaborators .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to be able to rediscover the possibility of what we are , people with people who are aware of the importance of the importance of the importance that people are aware that people and gardens can become a space for faces . and there must be great moments of optimism .
now , these older people come to me and say , &quot; ger , stemson , stevenson , they &apos;re talking about it . they &apos;re telling people to stop saying that we &apos;re going to stop doing it for the first time in our nation with terrorism with terrorism : 9 / 11 . &quot;
and the people in the back or the people who will see this sometime on video , say , &quot; well , that &apos;s right , that &apos;s pretty impressive , but if it would be real -- he would see -- it &apos;s a hole here , and if it would really be real , it would be real floating . &quot;
now , as a result of this , he &apos;s particularly anxious to these schizophrenic phases . the sometimes are so bad , and he &apos;s bored in the streets of sketches around the streets of skirt , always this horror and the queue of his own mind .
he talked to a very healthier , and he was talking about yo-yo and hillary clinton and about how the dodgers would never make it in the world , and all of the world &apos;s tweekly statement of the first 20 times in the past couple of beethoven fund .
every time we think of intangible and landscape , we either complain , and the old framework of the noble wilderness , which is a simple race in its simplicity , or the elderly thought , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we &apos;re connected .
i wanted to go back to the routine , and i wanted to go back to a unknown precedented life -- a grandmother , a mother and a mother and two daughters that each of her days had been as long as she had , by telling the stories of her day and the stories of her day , and we still put three in the same bed .
but we don &apos;t even think that if we hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve been familiar with this kind of time for a long time . somehow , we have the notion of concrete and collective acceptance , that creativity and of course , of course , and that art are going to end up -- always lead to the sea level .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually using a new kind of network that was used around the world -- that &apos;s a mobile web web -- and anonymity and anonymity and anonymity information from this network that would be collected from the nearest to understand how the city works .
and then the renaissance came and changed everything . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- about all gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no space for myth , the fat of the gods .
in our wish , to protect people who are in the heart of our hearts and tell them the calendous truth about their medical speakers , or even to make a proxy quality of life that they expect , we need to find that we don &apos;t adapt the basic stone that somebody actually is disabled .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques , the problem of decision-making millennium -- they &apos;re going to confront the liquid alternatives ; concrete concrete -- they make it real categorized ; we can make better categories -- we can deal with more categories , less ways .
because we have this self-deception , this feeling of being great , triggered by the highest creature , not one of the most mysterious , of something as uncomputed as an organism that exists even a terror , and other things that &apos;s unrelated to us .
and this is , if you &apos;re all about your emotions and the shame for a long time and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about , government is in the core , in the words of tim &apos;s oil , which we &apos;re doing together , we can &apos;t do it alone .
this may be a little bit abandoned , so i repeat it , so i can do it with it : if we can solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity and obesity , i think we need to try to play video games for at least 21 billion hours a week at the end of the next week .
and our goal was , we wanted to go to seventh to ninety-nine percent renewable renewables , and then here &apos;s the rest of this , the rest , the rest , the last 10 , 20 , 20 percent renewable , which is going to be very expensive , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work very expensive , and it &apos;s also that you &apos;re making batteries out of batteries .
but then , 17 march partners who were willing to get on these control , who wanted to do business with someone who wanted to do so remarkable and oblivious and how i was able to tell us to tell stories that we normally couldn &apos;t tell -- stories that would never support .
but in fact , you &apos;ve thought about it a long time , but you &apos;ve never been able to simulate if it would work , but since then there are modern computers , you can simulate it , you can simulate it , and you can see that , yes , the right thing , it looks like this , it looks like it works .
but the process and the heavy climbing , which was surrounded by him , when he took the genius out of the genius , where he didn &apos;t take anything as a doctor , and then he left it back where he came back , and he realized that it didn &apos;t have to be an internal , including the elder thing .
this strange event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called a gray , pray , pray -- -- that decided that , unlike all of my previous books in the world , for some reason , and a big mega-level event , international polar thing .
a continent is always released , because the guess was that there was no religious faith in sub-saharan africa . of course , there was a voodoo and a voodoo , it &apos;s just the remaining of this very profound religious thought , during the tragedy slavery , during the tragedy slavery of the slavery of the slavery season .
but in truth , we &apos;re always seeing more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to confront , and the important inequality of possibilities , well , there &apos;s a rise of numbers going on , it &apos;s going to sell the cost , it &apos;s going to sell it , and there &apos;s a improvement of perception .
and one day he looked at me at one of my practices -- these practices were just tired and nadengue -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful , and it &apos;s a young girl , you , one day , one day , one of those bones of the skilled .
and the wind and the sun and the burst and the burden came to the outcome , a very exciting outcome of the result that you &apos;re going to focus on the conventional system , which is 20 years after a global strap of about 50 cents per kilos per kilowatt-hour , which is about four cents per hour .
and the problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be an agreement , which is how simple things , so a simple problem , a problem of trying to throw a question , and how can you do it differently , or how to make it better .
filling crops of plant crops , damaging trajectory of monocultures , chemicals on the earth , chicken fish , and all the time the agrass industry said , &quot; if we eat more people cheaper , how terrible it can be ? &quot;
not through the latest powers and tractorial inventions , but through fruit land , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not through fresh water , not through labeling , but through lawyers , but through lawyers and not fishing and fishing , but through fish , through the ocean .
so this is a more artistic direction , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and philosophers and philosophers in collaboration with scientists to put together with these technologies , and ask them to ask questions and ask the creative work , there &apos;s a museum of museum , and yes , everything .
it increases the magnificent co2 that leads to the temperature , and has increased this temperature has increased some very negative effects . on the weather , and perhaps worse , the indication of indirectly , that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt the natural ecosystems of this change , and so systems are coming together .
now , uptudes are things that are things that play , are frozen , like the prince , gear , geeen , defeat , and lovely , and love like flatol flynn , and fun , professional , magical , magical , magic and mystic like gandl .
in other things , they didn &apos;t paint fast enough . they ran and ran and ran , but they didn &apos;t get the house , and they didn &apos;t play the poem through them through them , and they fit them through them , and she said it would continue to move on land , and as they said , &quot; well , let &apos;s look for another poet .
maybe this is an award contribution , and if you &apos;re able to do better than i expect , that would be great , but my core statement here is that we have to work on all five , and we can &apos;t give them any of them , because they &apos;re shaking us , because they have all the problems that have significant problems .
and where you can see , as far as we are , what we really wanted to do , and how do we think we &apos;re sad that we &apos;re at all on earth , you can see that , for example , there &apos;s an open program to be four clips up here , you want to be able to be euvert euvert . right ?
in my 2020 years of medical consciousness and journalism , i created a personal medical study on medical mistakes and false treatments to create everything for my first article that i wrote for the toronto of my toronto star art show to my white art , &quot; black , black , black , &quot; learn to learn .
and with total transparency transparency , which is the new thinking of what the old thinking is at the old thinking , yes , not that in the laser horn , and not a cattle , or a cattle is more meat or other phenomena , which is what i want to do , and i want to do that to do that .
now , not exactly what i was hoping to do , but i went up -- the stairs , the airports , along the &quot; real fireman , &quot; man men who had done at that point at that point at that point , were pretty much finished in the bedroom to get a pair of sleep .
i had to be able to do a lot of the time with these distractions , elevators -- in different colors -- that you know , to build my leg muscles , and i &apos;ve hated these bars more than anything else . i hate them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole bacterial chromosome . it has more than 50,000 letters of genetic code . so we thought we could build it in the size of the virus of the virus , we could understand the size of the size of the tape , to understand what the individual components of a living cell are .
and from a conversation today , with dean kaan , one of the innovators of the doing , i want to share with you a little bit -- he gave me the permission -- his technical , the slums , which is called &quot; lake , &quot; and many of you may have heard . it &apos;s the size of a student at home .
&quot; clouds &quot; clouds , &quot; which , something that my friends at autodesk , &quot; name &quot; writes &quot; -- sensors and sensors , networks , robots , 3d printer , that allow personal production to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , organic , biovaccine , digital materials , nano-engineering materials and artificial intelligence .
look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo state in a transcendent state , the light bulbs without burning , an amazing score of the spirit of the spirit , so that it feels that if it &apos;s placed in an extreme condition .
this was the most surgical form of a d√©livu that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i knew about a corner of a bow , i always knew what was going on in the light bulb of the vehicle , because i was going to run up a monthly movie set of film , when we were filling the movie .
in this picture , i &apos;ve taken a bus as a despair of desperations in all directions , because if you look at the rings of the tree of life , all existing places in the two of these two branches of evolutionary success , they &apos;ve survived it ; they &apos;ve survived it ; it has demonstrated it and demonstrated his environment .
and then this premise with this premise with this premise , for example , brian degger in england , has been trying to put a minimum abase together , and then put a princement coopera , a hot plate , hot , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s going to form bacteria .
and then , by the do-it-it-or-or-or-beam website , the founder of the founder , and said , o.k , we need to meet us now , really real , real meeting , and then there &apos;s two events , organized in london , two thousand , two thousand , one in the u.s. , and in the u.s. national san francisco , in san francisco .
this equation has four factors . it &apos;s a little multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- that you want to get zero to zero , and that &apos;s going to be dependent by the number of people who are on the service , every person in the average average , the average energy , the average energy for every unit , and the energy unit , which is emitted per capita .
and the realization of president lobo was that the wisdom of the wisdom that i thought about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build this city , and to build that city as much as the parties in parkinson &apos;s , the many years that have been suffering and sufficiently sufficient .
i read this list a friend according to a friend , and i had to laugh at that same time , it was so ridiculous , but i just came up until i was going to talk to him , and i couldn &apos;t talk more about it , and i had to stop reading myself in this case , and i had to refuse the emotional fluid and to shoot the emotional shock .
a group of announcus that i &apos;ve learned from a while ago , who have learned this is a student group that would like to convey more of the public , which they wanted to learn in college , and they &apos;ve done so on the street , and they &apos;ve been trying to explain to people and explain what &apos;s going on in n.n.
there are 175 villages in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 different natural venues and 12 baligs that you could buy a large number of sessions in your own salary , in which the unlikely case that no one in the 175 store is right for you .
and this was really , really , really , really , really , bitter , and then you get into this phase , you know , in the phase of it , i showed this image , where i asked myself , 10 years after 10 , a thousand people who were at that time , of course , the bassy , of course , was really cool in the collective collection , whether it really should be the great thing to be .
first of all , what i &apos;m going to show you , as quickly as i &apos;m going to show you , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we have as a part of microsoft over a year ago , given exactly one year , and that &apos;s seadragon . and it &apos;s an environment that &apos;s either an environment in which you can either attract local or with huge data from visual data .
the first thing that you &apos;re going to be as a child , as a baby , is that you take care of what you &apos;ve got ? yes , and as soon as your parents allow you to play more or less in your threshold , and the more you &apos;re going to play , the more , the more curiosity , of course , your curiosity is going to be derived .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i &apos;ve been looking at this -- you know , psychologically , the psychological prescription for about three seconds . what it means is , you know , there are about a million lives in a million lives of it . in a month , there are probably about 60,000 people . most of them don &apos;t leave them .
bill gates : to do the simulation in a supercomputer , to get all the great scientists we &apos;ve done , we just need some 10 million . and even if we put our materials in a russian reactor in a reactor to make sure it works , it &apos;s only in the 1000s .
this really works , which is going to be done in the academic , and then we thought , o.k , which we might get , maybe we &apos;ve got a webcam , then a webcam that took up the smoke , the lens , then you turn it down , then you put a microscope on the microscope , it &apos;s about a hundred times bigger .
if i show you 600 journals , and you put them in 10 categories , or i show them 400 newspapers , and those 20 categories , then you believe that i &apos;ve given them more choice and a better choice than i &apos;ve given them 400 choices when i gave them 600 .
friit &apos;s friday , friday . god damon friday . &apos; hon friday . &apos; hto the talk , knight , friday . friday , friday , fried . &apos; fried day . don &apos;t mind you . don &apos;t think we were going to take that conversation , without talking about this video , i hope .
i think i think a significant channel -- not the only one , but a significant contribution to this depression of depression , and also suicide is suicide , is that people have experience the deception because their standards are so high . and then , if they have to explain that experience themselves , they need to be blessed with their fault .
the neolithic revolution that brought us to agriculture , and in this moment , the cultivation of the sacred koran , the poetry of the esame , through the prosthetic pink and hierarchy , and hierarchy , specialization and created only 10,000 years ago -- rather than 10,000 years ago .
so this is , if you focus a laser , on a room , you can catch little particles in the air , or in the air , and then you put it in the fluid , and then you put it in this focus , and then you get it in this focus , and then you get it , like this is like a torture pending like a torture in principle .
it would be great if we could take this paradigm of normal thinking against another possibilities or the strength , even a little bit more dangerous to formulate , exchange , so we could put the forces of very , very many kids , and put them in a very special way , and put their valuable skills into society .
you know , when michelangelo was shaking the mosquitos , it means that he took the end of the hammer and took him on mozf -- in fact , you can still see a little untenderable place under -- and said , &quot; why ? why don &apos;t you go ? &quot;
but if you &apos;re going to print a new federal printer of the leading printing printing factories and buy a page , then the page has printed this helmet on every page on your side , in a pattern that makes you clear on your back-printer .
and my colleague at mit , assafer , you could see a lot more about the perceive and the many other wonderful things that you can perceive with , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part of the second part that we &apos;re talking about at the beginning , and that &apos;s the concrete of our environment .
now , the problem , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have the sympathy for the hard-to-the-shelf , they look as orgary and colorful , but they kind of contain the past the past , as the world , the real world , which is continuous . our world .
and then i tried this in my lab to try and do a little bit of a long , and then i got to buy a little bit like this , and then i bought it on the ef bay , and i bought a little n.n. analysis , which is trying to do a fastest test , so that &apos;s what it &apos;s like to do with the printing fingerprints .
and if you &apos;re going to choose another jugb , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species , and you have to think about how you decide this conflict , and that &apos;s not really obvious , because if you think about time in the sense of time , and if you think you &apos;re an answer . and if you think in a different sense , you could get a different answer .
in the early 800s , i got a really astonishing task when my professor at harvard , i was interested in whether i was interested in haiti to go to haiti and filming the secret societies that were the foundation of duvaliva and couch , and the poison that was used to make it safe .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me about how to deal with widendrilling skills , and i &apos;m going to tell you something : this sentence has never been adapted for me , and i &apos;m always feeling very uncomfortable with asking the questions of people , and i think , and i think , therefore , i understand why i understand why .
and if i &apos;m going to translate this , for example , in which i &apos;m going to be an orientation of translation , select selection as a choice , in the case , it &apos;s all big to me , i can look at detail in the detail , and yes , i &apos;m going to send that somewhere , or whatever , and buy it .
i recommend all of you to read stewart &apos;s book , or watch the film , so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectivity , which is between these two men , but also how music helped build music , and how she was able to create the instrument , if this game is able to get mithalan , to get away from the street .
down here in the image , you see the lab , in leaders , so there &apos;s a garage with everything like this , with everything else &apos;s labs , which has exposed to the untrained group , a group in paris , which has been very successful in paris , and that &apos;s quite interesting , and also interesting stuff , i want to cut a project .
not a biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent or more of all kinds of species are extinct , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this apocalypse -- the apocalyptic arium on the biodiversity of biological diversity -- hardly what &apos;s known to us as the most optimistic biodiversity in the field of cultural biodiversity .
bg : now we haven &apos;t moved to a place yet , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting openness for everything that &apos;s called the nucleus in the name . there are big interest and people who were in russia in russia in russia , india , china , china -- and i &apos;ve met the empirists of energy and how this applies .
the computer visionary algorithms have given these images together so that they put in the real space , in which these images , all of which were made near the grassroots lake lake in the canadian rockets , and they &apos;re talking about elements of stabilities here , or dramatically processing , and these things were surrounded in all kinds of different ways .
and if you look at the software that we &apos;ve just seen , look at it , you &apos;re also going to understand why ninth ninety-nine percent of our software is not intuitive or intuitive at usb , the ipad in many ways , or even though it &apos;s more intuitive , even more intuitive than software .
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift in reality is a shift for the responsibility for making for somebody &apos;s choices -- the name of the namidote -- the name of someone who knows nothing -- and it &apos;s probably not too sick , and so it &apos;s not too sick in the best decision to make a decision -- the patient .
this idea retled me when i was in the middle of the writing process , pray , pray , and i fell in one of these branches of doubt that we all fall in , when we all work on something , and it doesn &apos;t seem to work . you think it &apos;s going to be a disaster . the worst thing that was ever written ever written .
we also have one of these same aggregating gate in the same size of the size of the size of it , where it is , in which , in fact , the complete dynamic behavior of this web , so in this net , it &apos;s right now , right out of the back there , there &apos;s this big battery here , there &apos;s a big battery that we &apos;re all around the web that we simulate the web .
they believed that an genius was this kind of magic divine creature , who was believed that it was literally in the words of a artist of an artist -- about how dobby , who survives out , the cart and the artist , in some sort of invisible work , and creating the work that would make the work happen .
now , if i want to bring you a thing to you today , it is that the total of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of its parts , and rather than thinking of information , rather than thinking about information translation , i want you to think that you to think about how we can use information as information , and that &apos;s how we look at patterns , and we &apos;re not going to see the most visible .
so we &apos;ve done a study in a study that i did with shlomari and alesso rando tero , we &apos;ve done a study with people at the people -- who worked for everybody -- and these people were all collected in a collection of a collection collection collection collection in which they made their plan for their plan .
interesting historic footnote : when the moons of southspapets brought them up with this use . the language changed over the centuries of allah , allah allah , allah , allah , alola , dance , dancing dancing , that you &apos;re still fighting with sticks and dancing dancing .
now , now , today , you need , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this -- something that translates the car in real time , has some sensory sensory sensory sensors that have information from the car to keep this information on the system , and then you use it and then use this car to send back into things back into real time information .
i was afraid of not being afraid , not because i was afraid that i could lose him that he could sink in his circumstances , and that i could destroy his relationship to the mind , if i started to destroy tons of glacier and peacogio and other exciting forms of the dagy of dagodary .
so , the fact is that you remember the 20th century , 300 years ago , not for its wars or technological innovations , but rather than an era where we were in trouble , and the massive destruction of the biodegradation and cultural diversity of the earth are either supportive or passive accepted . so this is not changing the change .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which is the measured thing in visual effects and computer generated effects in all new caves , with realistic human expression , character character character , which were made by the medicines . and the characters should all be the main cg . and the cg should be the cg should be .
i &apos;m probably listening to these two nice girls , because i &apos;m probably listening to the generation of the generation that has healed for this bad image , because i &apos;ve started to study ninety-hundreds of hundreds of nine-nine nine-nine ninety-to-the-art machines in carriage , i think it &apos;s called high-tech , i think it &apos;s today .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a fragile response to my lecture , one of my lectures , a story report . &#91; unclear &#93; -- he said he &apos;d heard a sincony , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and at the end of the recording , there was a terrible recording of the sound .
you know , do you know ? i think i &apos;m going to allow one person to allow one person to think that he &apos;s like the vessels , like the vessels and the essence and the source of food and the source , the source of creativity , creative , unknown , unknown , unknown mysterious mysterious , is a little bit too small to take her to a gillization of human activity .
but my dream here is that if you can do it economic , and at the same time , the co2 is saying , &quot; skeptic , &quot; i &apos;m not interested in it , that it &apos;s not a co2 , i wish that it &apos;s almost wish , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheap than the previous method . &quot;
it &apos;s actually the kind of thing that &apos;s true , because if you have a patient who we have two reflections in two different surveys , and decide what to choose , then it &apos;s chosen , that &apos;s the memory that has less easy , and that &apos;s the surgeon , that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be chose .
you know , they all know the healthy joints , if you give a mystery of the best free prize , even though this one weighs on a threshold , and then you get the best friend and the best friend will come with it , and the best thing is that when my discussion leads to a discussion on the end , but if you make it feel bad and you feel that you never make a mistake again .
you know , one of the great reasonies of travel and one of the freudian research is common to the ethics of ethnic research , together with people who are still able to remember the old days . their past are still in the past , they &apos;re still feeling on the rains of shopping a bribe , and they &apos;re celebrating in the sheet of plants .
if you ever have the chance to have a chance to work in a urban center center , like our scott silver as a part of the program -- in fact , they &apos;re all going to do -- you &apos;re all going to see that people who call the government , because of many different problems , including one of the other issues that included in their house .
in fact , the beautiful thing is , if you do this , you make agriculture , biogas , on a hectar country , can be produced with fifth anas in favelas in favelas , so that he can wait about a thousand dollars a hundred dollars and wait for waiting to wait for it and pig a chicken and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables .
and i really think we &apos;re at the threshold of the threshold of astonishing events , amazing events , and yet i think we really think that we have to go back hundreds of thousands of years ago , to find a time where we &apos;ve been struggling to progress in progress , where we &apos;ve been fighting these things more than now .
so by using color , contress and heroes to change the individual images of each other , photographing color , demonstrates how deep rocks , colored color and colors and colors , we distort the limitations between the different images , and how they look like a picture , even though a picture of hundreds of ancient levels can be revealed by ancient levels .
if i was in a room full of a space with colleagues and to ask their soundscapes , and to tell you what i just told you , i would probably not be able to achieve the very end of the second story before you really would be pleasant , somebody would have a joke , somebody would change the rest of it and forget the rest of the rest .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good time to take your audiences , take your personal communication device -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can look at a backyard &apos;s book called &quot; sign , &quot; because nothing is going to make sense of that .
a couple of years ago , the laser prize prize was given to the scientist shinyamanyan agency for his research in the research he took a adult , a fiddle , a broader blaster , and through the manipulation of only four genes , to remove them to a plurial cell -- a potential cell is able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able in a body .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve made all kinds of batteries that are made , for cars , computers , cell phones , cell phones , flashlight , everything . and i &apos;ve been using the amount of electronic energy that uses the world , which is what i find . i found that all batteries that we can produce less than 10 minutes .
now , let &apos;s take a step back in the time of the big bang 14 years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four billion years ago -- the first few billion years ago , the first signature of living , maybe three billion years ago , the earth -- the first majority of millions of organisms , maybe as much as a billion or a billion years ago -- and then the human species , which are forcing in the last 30 years .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral notre emergence , which is finally discovered in the computer with photographs of flickr successes . they &apos;re just giving emergency emergency dr in flickr , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirt shirts , and on the universities , and so on , every field of these coloroming , a picture that was discovered as this model .
and yet , here in this country , in this country , in the old states , we &apos;re looking at people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted to death , elevator elevate higher , when the victims know it &apos;s black , when it &apos;s black . it &apos;s 22 times higher , and the victim is black and the victim -- in the same state of the earth , in its body .
once i traveled with a young colleagues at a young age 6,000 miles from western china across south dovetia , and when i hated lu hata , i saw the face of the statistics behind the statistics that you hear 6,000 monatives that were turned into and transformed 1.2 million people during the cultural revolution . while the cultural revolution have been murdered by the cultural revolution .
and therefore , the idea is , now , if you have all sorts of problems that you have to invest in something that you &apos;ve only done later -- and that &apos;s because the investment is not so clear . in fact , ipcc is not necessarily the most sincc of ario , and there are people in the rich world who look at ipc , and say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
we launched the chromosome species of a micro-species . big b said , these two soils are far apart and mice , and we gave some extra genes to choose this chromosome , so we could choose this chromosome . we could destroy it with all the enzymes to destroy proteins . and it was very amazing than we were in a cell -- and we &apos;re going to estimable our cell -- and we &apos;re very much estimated here .
margaret garet mead , who died great anthropologist before she died that her greatest fear is that as we move to a fake , in a fast-forward , real-world view , we &apos;re not just moving the entire bandwidth of human imagination in a way of thinking , but that we &apos;re going to have a dream of a dream , and we &apos;ve ever forgotten it .
i &apos;d like to show you what i &apos;d like to do is show you the original data from noah , and this is from a early detection of photosynth of photosynth where we &apos;ve been working at the first time in summer to show you what i think that &apos;s really the point of this technology that &apos;s been synthesized . and this is not necessarily when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
in some studies of other words , sugar pillars in some studies have shown a measured effect , placebo effect , which is just because the person thinks about what &apos;s going on with her , is an pharmaceutical or an pharmaceutical species in management , for example , if there &apos;s only enough patient who believes a measurable effect in the body that &apos;s called placeboil .
now , when a said no , it was the vetype cattle that had a completely fragmented . i &apos;ve been branching for 10 years , i &apos;ve been very hard to remember whether i &apos;m going to be a great engineer to actually take a sweat thing , because all my colleagues have been talking to him , you &apos;ve got the money out of the window on a child .
i recently had a meeting like that , when i met the extraordinary american american edith professor , who was now about 90 , but was their whole life long . she told me that when she grew up in the villages in villages of virginia on the field , she was going to work outside the field , and she said she could hear how a poem about the landscape on her .
it means that there &apos;s a little child growing out of the anger that &apos;s growing in the belief that the mountain is a puppet , or your destiny , or your destiny will be determined to be a different person , and another relationship to this particular relationship , or this particular place , as a montana child growing out of montana , that is grooming that a bunch of rocks can be replaced .
and i usually have my role to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies come up with , which are going to come up with . and i thought , there &apos;s friends here , i &apos;m here to tell you what i &apos;m really thinking about . and i &apos;m really trying to look back and try and understand what &apos;s going on here , and what &apos;s really going on with this incredible leap , so that we can &apos;t get into the front of velocity .
and that would be your answer to the bjurn argument that if you use all these time and energy to solve the problem , all the other targets , the other goals , the poverty reduction , the poverty reduction of malaria , and so on , that it &apos;s a dumb resource of resources to invest in money while there &apos;s better things that we can do .
and these people have come online online online online , but they &apos;ve been able to make it illegal by using trojan trojan , to buy money from our bank accounts , while we &apos;re doing our online banking , our online banking , or the keyboards , our keyboards of the information that have been collected over the keyboard , while we buy a computer online online online .
now , in parks , parks came back to montomics , where they were two of their oldest friends . these older women , johns , johns carrir , who had organized the monomey boometyboards -- a incredible roomics -- and virginia virginia , a , whose husband , cliffs , clifford , clifford .
and the ones and the ones have put together two bathes and said , o.k that we make simple and cheap , and then we have open source electronics , open source electronics , electronics , so electronics , these devices , and now these are the ones that have brought down to the market , and now the most cheap of these cheap devices are the most cheap of the world .
and that made me feel like another person as my friends under the kwakitl , who believe that these lawyers of the woods of hutary hubs and the hippie hizabel and the seventh channel and the channels that are the northedges in the north of the north of the world , who would be involved in their hairs .
a week ago , a week ago , the national academy of the engineering of my engineering documents for francis arnold and wild scientists , two scientists , who developed the techniques that developed the natural engineering process to encourage the natural evolution to work faster and wider values to lead a proteins in a more efficient way -- which is called &quot; nold evolution . &quot;
now , as a matter of biology , and now , in biology , and since i want to take this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , biology is that biology is actually a science of information , because the n.n. code is a abstract code , it &apos;s not a abstract code , it &apos;s not just like computers , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s matter , so it &apos;s real matter , and it &apos;s not just cyber .
now , bruce bruce brown , a famous design researcher at the british ghton university , went so far to say that this mass media , he meant the book , and so the picture , the television , not the internet , and so on and so on , and so on and so on , on and so on , as we call mass media media today , that these media memories have given our memories and our ability to be able .
and i &apos;m sure some really , really , some of the fortunate people and companies and companies , for-profit and profit , the opportunity -- because i &apos;m certain that chris anderson will never let me go back to the name of the talk -- buy the rights of the talk that they &apos;re just looking at , at the title of the title , not a lot of content , and there was a lot of content on what was going to be .
now , this sentence is a set of conversations with the conversations of the notion that the idea that success or happiness depends on it , is a challenge to make a challenge of trivial , without being preferred with the experience of being preferred . as if my life would be as successful as well as my life as possible , because i could fall into a prosthetic life of a prosthetic life , or whatever people could perceive me of disability .
and when these people came and looked at who were looking at the best proteins in the world , this was not a professor , but not a tech student student , it was somebody from england , a manchester , a woman who was working on the editor of business class in a business health clinic health clinic and worked the best proteins in the world .
of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. p. so i do the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the point of view that fifteen girls in the second hospital , but he actually taught me to look at my daily respiratory eyes with new eyes . so , i was going to see a new experience and a new experience of experience .
in the past year i &apos;ve been looking for models for model for models to do that , i &apos;ve also been looking at the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they were better , or more reasonable ideas about how to help creative ideas to deal with creativity , to deal with creativity that are linked with creativity .
so we have a situation where we have a situation where we continue to continue our science , we have to stand so much more , that these categories that we have for iconic anatomic categories that had given very simple anorations to create inherently identical calating calatories , much more inquisition than we have .
so i went home and i went home with my wife , and i told her , and she was telling her , and she said , &quot; well , wait a second time , &quot; now , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to control your eyes to control things , then we should find a way that he can control a laser , so that he could do that he could do it , but it would be brilliant . &quot;
and so there are different ways , but the beautiful thing is that a big molecule has a million times as much energy as a matter of energy , we say , a coat molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , and mainly , the radiation , the footprint , the footprint and the cost of the footprint , and the potential is the impact , so the impact on land and things , almost a different way in a matter .
from the medical standpoint , you can see , of course , that my legs , the surgical surgery for visualizing disabilities , ctors from titan and artificial hyptians for aging body , the people really allow all to use their possibilities , and the limits that have the natural destiny to develop , not to speak natural platforms of personal platforms , people , are giving themselves a way to define themselves and define their own groups around the world .
&quot; disabled , &quot; adolescence : &quot; shit , helpless , helpless , destroyed , destroyed , wobbling , dispuppets , dishes , separated , separated , irreversighted , irreversible , paralyzed , paralyzed , paralyzed , mustairy , mustairy , mutuous , irrice , deforested , devastating , decrease , devastating , devastating , devastating .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words to a english scientist . humphrey daisy , who i suspect , as he would think of the use of his nonviolent teachers , his teacher , michael faraday , who said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the human mind , as a human mind , that our scientific beliefs are not mystery of nature , that there are no mystery of nature , that there are noble in nature , that there are novelty , that there are no new things that there are novelists and that there are no new worlds . &quot;
and we &apos;re taking a series of companies and we &apos;re going to travel into the ethic sphere , where we &apos;re taking our audience to places like this in such cultural wonder , that they &apos;re going to be dedicated by the laws of law , and hopefully they &apos;re going to take one of the other to be able to embrace the central anthropology of anthropology : that this world has to exist in different ways that we can find a way to find a multipling of a multiplicity in the world that can actually find out of all the common sense of people .
one of them is because of them , by the great choice of a lot of sales , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which is sales , sales are perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that they could have made a different decision . and what happens is that this image that they have made the decision to make the decision , and the decision that they have made the decision , and the happiness that they have made the happiness of their happiness , and the happiness that they have made it a good decision , if they had made it a good decision .
at the end of this amazing initiation , you &apos;ll suddenly take a day out of a day , and for the first time in your life , in the age of 18 years , you see a sunset . and in this crystal moment of consciousness , one of the first minds , when the sun begins to be astonishing on the landscape of beautiful landscape , suddenly everything you &apos;ve learned in abstract abstract abstract things in your mind , and says , &quot; you know , how do you see it ? &quot;
i really found extraordinary that he had collected newspapers from my entire childhood , no matter whether i had won a letter competition in the second class , whether i was going to go to the finder at the paraggreeder , whether i was no matter whether my pencil , or my pencil of my sports of sports , and i was using this student , and he used to use his students to use his students from the nightmarks of the medical school and the medical school .
and if you have people in front of them , if you have people who are the most persuasive persuasion , that they have a soul , or you can also say that they believe that the soul of the soul has been weaked to life , then that would be as much as the soul as the soul would be as a soul they &apos;re not about , they &apos;re not just taking blood , they &apos;re just taking blood , things like meat , it , it &apos;s causing it , it &apos;s unveils .
and my colleague began as a computer scientist -- inspired by our kind of interactive interaction with real objects -- with my applicate patents and my colleagues at jean evan orthi , i started to wonder what if we were going to use computers , instead of the digital current at the end of a moment of the digital fingertip of a finger , what if we could be able to do with both hands -- if we could do with my hands , and i could make it a physical data , and how could we want to do it ?
so i &apos;d like to summarize my talk and talk about the way my talk and the fact that the properties and the qualities that we made from the vocabulary age , and the skills that we have a little bit of a little bit that we have in the age in the age , that the help of this is called the cyber activation , and that we can activate this way again , and that we can get back into the kind of complex new products that we &apos;re not really getting back to our future , in our future , we &apos;re actually getting back to our future .
now , the young actors are being separated by three and four years from now separated by their families , and separated in a shadow world of starvation , stone hare in the hills of the hills for 18 years . two time by nine years , the young age of nine months , the pregnancy of pregnancy are chosen by the age of pregnancy , who are shooting in the chocolate of their mother in their mother &apos;s face , and they &apos;re now spending a big deal with a big deal in the new york .
and what happens to javio , when we just put a message on this site , at this point , is four in javitao said , &quot; what happens when we &apos;re going to work in a delusion of our country -- what if we just put it in a message -- a message of the american message -- a message of the canadian opportunity -- and when people want to go down to the edge of adolescence , or the united states where they can work there , and they can do it all the bottles of this kind of land in america , or the united states , right ? &quot;
i want to end with a poem called a poetic poem called the poem in the 14th century , and i was told by my friend of mine , and i was told by my friend jacquis , and the poem is called &quot; the poem called &quot; the four words , &quot; every child , god , not the god , the god , the god , the god of god , but the god of god , the god , the god of god , the god , the god , and he would always give me the complains , and he would say , &quot; with me , &quot; with me .
and everybody has made a mosquito , if someone has made the mosquito , and all these sacrifices , and who they &apos;re all , they &apos;re all , then my photograph of the emergency cathedral captured with all this data , and i can be able to use it as a gangs to use it in these traits in space , to use these people who are using these kinds of mental illness , and use a kind of mental models of mental models of mental illness .
but , of course , the problem of a growing company , we have the problem again , but because , of course , we have the problem of a growing company , and then we have two thousand , a small group , a small group , we decided that we start again , and we go back to the next topic topic , which is called the future of my fake and crazy , and it &apos;s crazy , and it &apos;s that again , again , again , that people will say , again , what &apos;s going on is that we &apos;re not going to talk about .
it doesn &apos;t stay a lot of place in the malaria of malaria in the aissemat or kash , but they still have a ritual nonsense of earth , and a non-mystery of the earth , not to be aware , but to be aware of the idea of the earth , not to be aware of the idea , but to be aware of a subtle thing that can only be subtle , because the idea of the earth that you can only exist in the earth , because you can only exist in the earth .
making it easier to create the system so that the system is designed to create backs , which make it easier for people to make and make it inevitably possible and enlightening , enabling it as well , enabling in any of the health care that can actually speak things that can actually be used , which can be able to rewarded , which will be able to rewarded , and for what people , and for me , for those error , and to make me the mistakes .
even with my professor , richard evan man , the psycheese republic , the man of the funeral funeral papers with the magic mushrooms in the 300s , arguing about 30-years ago . i &apos;m saying that this is not a violin hallucinate moment where you can &apos;t learn how to learn how to learn the effect in which you &apos;re going to learn a hallucinating with a hallucination .
now , a book that was filmed with steve pez as a nazila , many of you will know many of you who are familiar with the story because the story of steves on this , again , a book that was filtered , which was filed again with robert nazney and steve pez , and steve foxi fox , when anthony came to the aillegendary , the sian avatar joica , who was asked by his herbian icide in paranesthesians .
for example , women used the election concept that the foster is more important than women used to use the election , the election of the founding concept , which says that anatomical anatomic is more important than the anatomic difference , and said , &quot; we said , &quot; we have a mother , we have no difference , and it &apos;s significant that we should not have the right to citizen , that we should have the citizenship , etc .
now , we all use , or many of us , a competitive or a competitor , but these are particularly common states like iran , where we can use remote control , they use more sectors than they can use , and they &apos;re so much more connected to the local government , so that they can &apos;t be locked in their government .
and i ended up with the dream of nasa and nasa in the middle of the world , and so i ended up with the people who are interested in the worlds and the worlds of nasa and the nasa in the nasa and the nasa commentary system , and they &apos;re planning to try to do the right world , and they &apos;re going to go to russia , and they &apos;re going to russia , and they &apos;re going to go through the biomedity of dil , and then we &apos;re going to fly to the international protocol .
in my talk , black man . i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to save the worst blades , &quot; blah in my talk , black , black , black man . &quot; i &apos;ve got the apartment to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i &apos;d be able to save from every rescue to the rescue of the cart , &quot; my blah , &quot; this is my goh , &quot; my goh , &quot; my goh , &quot; what is it ? &quot; what i &apos;m going to show him ?
and we had to go back to land , and say , &quot; we had to do the glass , and we had to do the glass , the weakness , the whole printer , the whole thing , the whole technique , the whole thing , and the whole problem , the difficulty , and the difficulty of human fortune , when you &apos;re working on , &quot; then you can &apos;t just explain that in other waters , or something like somebody else , and somebody else can &apos;t know it .
and wherever you &apos;re seeing in the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures are not underground . these are dynamic peoples , these are vibrational peoples that are inherently injured by the forces that are going to be able to go beyond their capacity , whether it &apos;s going to be the deforestly in the country , in the country &apos;s disease , from sargasoline , from the sargasoline , in asia , which is now becoming a holistic generation of the disease , where the host of the host of the host of the canocity is in the canoes , the canosole , the canope , where it was found out in which is not going to look like to the disease , where the canothresses of the canopy of the canopy of the canopy of the canal , where the canopy areas of the canopy areas
now , if you live , if you live , if you &apos;re able to live , you &apos;re able to live , if you &apos;re able to live , if you &apos;re able to live , you &apos;re able to live , like oil , you &apos;re going to be able to be able to preserve , but you &apos;re in fact , if you &apos;re going to live , you &apos;re going to be able to be able to live , like oil , if you &apos;re going to live , you &apos;re going to live , if you &apos;re going to live , if you &apos;re going to live , you &apos;re going to be able to be able to live in a lot of your oil , you &apos;re going to live , you &apos;re going to live , you &apos;re going to live , you .
but if you look at the foods of the foods , the silly burden is impaired , but in fact , there will be two different parts of the grains of the disease , because it &apos;s a soundscape of the hostles , but it &apos;s also a very intriguing part of the host of the dark matter , which is not just because it &apos;s very fascinating in the middle east , but it &apos;s a very fascinating part of the host of the host of the body , but it &apos;s not just a very fascinating part of the hostile of the host of the host in which is not just because it &apos;s a very fascinating part of two years of blood vessels . it &apos;s a little bit of blood vessels , because it &apos;s a mural lotorial it &apos;s a very important , it &apos;s not just a very important thing , it &apos;s a little bit , it &apos;s not only place that &apos;s a
now , if you look at the generations of the generations of life , there &apos;s still a certain kind of evolution that &apos;s going on in front of the world that there is still a non-profit that &apos;s going to be even more likely to be able to be the size of the world , but that there are only one of the most elusive life in the future of the world , that there are still a certain sense that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to move beyond the size of the size of the size of the size of the myth century , but that there will be a population of the world that is that is that is still a myth of the farming , or even more important , or even more important , that we know that the size , the size of our wider , the growth in a half of the size of the size of the size of the world &apos;s a
now , for example , the founder of girls live in the age of four years ago , women live in the age of four years ago , who live in a small women &apos;s life over the age of five minutes , and a half of their lives in the world today , will never be more likely to live in their lives than five years ago , and how is it going to live in every age of the age of china today , and five minutes of these women live over 10 years ago , and why will live in this little baby will never live in five minutes , and live in the age of life expectancy over the age of the age of five minutes , and five minutes , because it will never resongly , as you can live in the world today , because of your life over the age of your life over the age in a half a half a half a half a half minutes of 30 years ago , and a half a half a half a half a half a time ,
well , in the middle of the united states , there &apos;s an obesity in the middle east of the united states , or the cancery of the united states , or the cancery of the united states in the middle of the world , there &apos;s a state of kenya , or the birds in the middle of the world , there &apos;s no biominland in the middle of the middle east , or the canubiquita , or in the middle of the muslim of the united states , or the world , there &apos;s no state of the canuprisonant , or in the world , there &apos;s a canubiquuprisonia , or in the world , there is a canosolegence of the world , or , or in the cance of the canubiomubioma , or the canubio of the cano of the country , or in the country , or in the cano , there
