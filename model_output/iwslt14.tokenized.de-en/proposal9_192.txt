thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
from seattle ...
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s what singers do .
but it goes .
not finance .
yes , hello .
we love innovation .
solar technology is ...
this is not ...
we were poor .
are they all ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
after a week .
great trick ?
we were .
a few less .
and he says ...
we know that .
ta-dah !
twice .
here it is .
this is going fast .
they need time .
music as a language .
that &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... not yet .
thank you .
what a fish .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
that &apos;s efficient .
wonderful , right ?
absolutely inefficient .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much .
silly .
the only chance .
no hospital .
thank you .
stephen watts .
three out of 10 .
that was incredible .
thank you . thank you .
yeah , it &apos;s like .
it &apos;s terrible .
long , yes .
fantastic , right ?
the sun is going down to the sun .
oh my god .
we love entertainment .
we raise off .
after home ?
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we lose it .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
a lot of things .
does that sound good ?
the whole environmental discussion .
sounds familiar , what ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
that &apos;s important .
that was fascinating .
can i be honest ?
the farm is incredible .
what did they do ?
robert gupta .
that &apos;s the system .
that &apos;s all about it .
yes , good day .
lento , slowly .
it all cares me .
we can do that .
what do you say ?
not very sustainable .
yes , milliseconds .
that &apos;s our present .
they have similar principles .
yes , good day .
good work ! yes !
just do your job .
this was the result .
thank you very much .
and she did .
so they meet .
it &apos;s essential .
they &apos;re all important .
very different ideas .
incredibly exciting .
that &apos;s me .
it &apos;s humble .
yeah , that &apos;s going on .
flying cone .
this is the last one .
can we change it ?
these days are over .
these people deserve money .
what happened here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
do it again .
and that &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know .
centers have been built .
what happened here ?
but you know what ?
what was the result ?
i was amazed .
it &apos;s generic .
so they knew everything .
you could see manhattan .
here &apos;s the video .
it has sensors .
why not live longer ?
he opens the door .
a few more .
that &apos;s very good .
oh , that &apos;s the guy .
there &apos;s no normal .
yeah , i know .
pretty good , right ?
but you know what ?
i have a question .
okay . thank you .
i stood up to him .
don &apos;t sit around .
so they can do that .
they &apos;re tracked . &quot;
so let &apos;s see .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
what do these people need ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i thought about it .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
they use their hands .
so how does this work ?
how interested they are .
that would have been okay .
what are media today ?
you can go inside .
so where do we go ?
so it &apos;s true .
how do we know that ?
because you know what ?
it &apos;s not a country .
why do we do that ?
not very often .
bg : thank you .
this is a wish .
and i was an artist .
let &apos;s call it .
not school management .
and it has to go back .
we can do it differently .
they even do hurt .
and i understand that .
an enormous challenge .
there &apos;s no food .
it &apos;s against justice .
but the wrong things .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
i &apos;m a writer .
here &apos;s another example .
i &apos;m treating children .
it feels great .
i swear it .
i wonder .
it &apos;s not going to do that .
thank you very much .
why should we do that ?
thank you .
here &apos;s an example .
you see it immediately .
not poisoning in the toxic .
but i kept working .
or before bombs .
i &apos;ll go in here .
there are two ways .
we need energy miracles .
why does this happen at all ?
oh . wait a minute .
let me tell you .
what do you want to do ?
this is what happens to us today .
and i kept working .
so she was back .
and so it was .
yeah , here it is .
i agree with them completely .
and why is that ?
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what would all be done ?
i mean the soul .
you do the same thing .
in china , it was different .
luckily , right ?
it &apos;s not a protection .
give pee a a chance .
does anybody see something ?
and i always had .
very expensive real estate .
people were crazy .
what creates the illusion ?
my gut feeling again .
after only one trip there .
first of all , narrowing .
i created one .
yeah . all right .
imagine the camera .
jk : both .
but it gets worse .
here you see it .
thank you very much .
be a mentor .
maybe 10 times .
but it didn &apos;t .
the data came in .
that &apos;s a great question .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
it has billions of those .
did you see these guys ?
but there &apos;s something else .
here &apos;s another example .
is it any photography at all ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
ohhh .
and then it became international .
there were remixes .
let me summarize you .
okay , a few more .
the answer to that is no .
just further . fun .
my name is amit .
he had the experience .
it keeps you fresh .
that &apos;s a great question .
is that your opinion ?
a nearly identical structure .
and it got even better .
that &apos;s what she does .
it &apos;s very enjoyable .
here you see the city .
good afternoon , all together .
am i going to like color ?
ooh , thank you .
some have come and gone .
i don &apos;t think so .
dk : 60,000 .
there &apos;s an old study .
it wasn &apos;t discouraged .
the game is from 2007 .
this is not true for emotions .
it &apos;s called paul open .
what happened to you ?
who will make it safer ?
we first have the population .
i don &apos;t like that question .
but what do your fish eat ?
let &apos;s call it .
this is billboard .
the work of interprets .
but where are we useful ?
they had no mass media .
how do we actually work people ?
... his own story .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
so what does that mean ?
now , what does that mean ?
privacy needs to be given .
there are online criminals .
we have three main groups .
it was still fish .
he always showed up here .
and then it happened again .
i felt really good .
and many people forget this .
crisis . sorry .
it would be intolerable .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
it &apos;s not our problem .
we have lost contact .
why not think about this ?
we love technology and creativity .
it would be unbelievable .
we are constantly pouring each other .
and this opens up a map .
but what do we do with that ?
that &apos;s about it .
what do i look at ?
his name is tempt .
will it be my size ?
that sounds crazy , right ?
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
we need to spread the message .
that &apos;s what most people know here .
you also have to understand .
you see that down there .
i want to ask you something .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and luckily he didn &apos;t die .
i find fascinating .
i find fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was devastated .
they look like this .
is it about light ?
i grew up in india .
that &apos;s the shoreline .
you see the water coming .
i had a good life .
so what happened for years ?
who are these relatives ?
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
these changes are coming in .
what about fitness ?
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
but the key thing is , ...
he works like this .
and then they set up .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
the orange one .
they really loved it .
but i felt bad .
the two of them smells to me .
woman : oblivious technology .
very scary .
what &apos;s the soul ?
we &apos;re not producing even more .
i can claim everything .
he went up and down .
what else can we do ?
this is what the chart looked like .
i &apos;m going to come to the end .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
it might sound vital .
we were 20 people .
so we &apos;re too many .
you can &apos;t have bones .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
or is it possible ?
conflicts emerge from conflicts .
so what do we need to do ?
they didn &apos;t have books .
this is felix .
actually , i made two mistakes .
thank you for your attention .
that was the beginning of the journey .
i &apos;m thrilled .
and then everyone went down .
they saw the big impact .
first extension , second .
well , i was the next .
frankly , who &apos;s normal ?
and finally , epic meaning .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
the same thing , just bigger .
who is the most successful ?
you want to feed the world ?
i wanted to support them .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
i only loved two .
the place is south korea .
again , you &apos;ve got it again .
this is such a natural thing .
my wife told me .
and how did that feel ?
that &apos;s what you can train .
does that make you curious ?
so it &apos;s circle .
so why are we hacking ?
this happened to christmas .
what is it for a thing ?
so , you know .
they could have done better .
the answer is yes .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
is this reasonable ?
so that &apos;s the good news .
it was a huge success .
so they saw something magical .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
five to one , great .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
can &apos;t be a problem at all .
they always say , why ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
it was just not invented .
so , quite a lot of these things should work .
anyone know what that is ?
for example , this perception in context .
this is a game outside .
this is god , you know ?
but it was very sad .
so let me remind you .
the answer is no .
and it &apos;s the x .
sometimes i get too much .
but they do the job .
and they connected these two people .
her mother moved her alone .
okay , there are a couple .
think about your own decisions .
this picture is from this place .
i see this sign .
and it took 18 months .
tell me about this world .
this is very risky .
and it worked very well .
the one showed him four .
i learned everything .
and there are hundreds of them .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there &apos;s good news .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
that made me really sad .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
but it &apos;s not so fast .
how can we help you ? &quot;
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
no , no was an opportunity .
the story is not over yet .
what happened that day ?
well , let &apos;s do it .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
that &apos;s how you feel . &quot;
they come from the artists .
i should not say that .
the power plant can explode .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
she did it for three years .
you can have this cloud .
the data was not available before .
play is not silly .
now , how could this happen ?
is it all just education ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
so , we can .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
they didn &apos;t changed the story .
everyone &apos;s talking today about happiness .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
game doesn &apos;t mean just child games .
and that was 19 years ago .
what would you like most ?
they create an episode of history .
they have so much uncertainty .
the data is constantly demonstrating .
nobody ever said that before .
so paul is a terrorist .
and that &apos;s what he says .
don &apos;t take anything as well .
i mean , i &apos;m journalist .
what should our beliefs look like ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
i &apos;m never going to cook it .
she was back and die .
and of course , this is incredible .
and again , this is the representation .
it didn &apos;t have that soul .
an autistic student .
if it &apos;s the waste right now .
so not like detox .
and we take it all .
we depend on two countries .
everybody needs a gold fish .
let them be true . &quot;
people were still happy .
it was my first sunny .
in fact , he gathered fish .
my name is brian goldman .
she shares her experiences with others .
the white lines are for population .
that &apos;s why i did the movie .
he showed up on the algae .
it &apos;s not just technological .
there are four and a thousand people .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
and we &apos;re very happy about that .
everyone is nutrient .
and we &apos;re too many .
so the question is : how ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and it was an incredible experience .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
but there are two problems involved .
i started feeling better .
but you know what ?
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
that was grandiose .
i talk a lot about these questions .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us too much .
that &apos;s it , it &apos;s very simple .
we are in a field .
and then we did .
they &apos;re basically doing the same thing .
now this is one of the images .
what other brands ?
and then something weird happened .
you can play with different types .
the whole building was made of water .
italy . yeah .
the morning , before the game .
it wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
the creativity had to kind of get out .
today , everything is too simple .
the nurse asked the nurse .
i should not do that .
maybe even in our cell phones .
and it starts with a doctor .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
we use the energy of the sun .
these are all metadata .
i can claim everything .
it will always be more like this .
but slowly it was safe .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
what are you trying to do ? &quot;
further than we don &apos;t go .
what lessons have we learned ?
and the form plays a role .
you can &apos;t store energy .
then i can transmit it all .
okay , that &apos;s really courageous .
once we started a vivid .
my second mistake was worse .
and she swallows a 257 .
we all love baseball , right ?
somehow , kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
they &apos;re becoming free to the computer .
because someone &apos;s massage here ?
and then he agreed .
below the other things shouldn &apos;t suffer .
this one has the biggest impact .
the mood , to write it .
anyway , not to navigate .
and that &apos;s pretty much in the beginning .
the truth is more like this .
do you want to name jeans ?
you can &apos;t do anything like that .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
their family gathered .
thank you very much .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
what else is risky ?
just be , who you are .
i remember my first fire .
what about a story ?
dark in dark . dark .
now i tried a little bit more exciting .
but all of a sudden and effective , yes ?
but we need the total .
numerous versions , yes ?
it &apos;s totally inertia .
let &apos;s get it quietly .
hmmm , my brand ?
this is scary .
that sounds frightening .
next : nuclear energy .
a very exciting phenomenon .
i wanted to be very normal at that time .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you now .
as soon as the judge saw me .
we can &apos;t just do that .
so i went to court .
i got a little scared of technology .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
and there are several reasons for this .
they sell certificates .
it &apos;s not being documented .
why am i in medicine ?
it can know where we are .
it spread rapidly .
all adults were aware of the risks .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i like things that are different .
i went to prison -- hard .
it didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
this is a child game , right ?
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
and this video is in real time .
the game begins -- swiss .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
what about longevity ?
they &apos;re just better than reality .
so the correlation is low .
so , look what happens .
it &apos;s really changed the dynamic .
so i just started to play .
and then we said , okay .
yes , these are the data .
i &apos;m shooting through the head .
were you ever thinly dispute ?
this is like a talking talk .
because for me , it means memory .
how did he feel ?
we say in germany .
so you can &apos;t fix it .
music is medicine . music changes us .
it turns out it &apos;s really hard .
and you know what i learned ?
these are going to be unresistant .
but what &apos;s going to come to the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
this has nothing to do with science .
and that can make a big difference .
but there &apos;s another reason .
anyway , we need a solution .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
so i &apos;m listening to , thank you .
they took the channels .
in the assumption , maybe two percent .
we started this 15 years ago .
how far do you get there ?
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
you know what &apos;s neither ?
so the first step to a interpretation .
and it &apos;s still not a interpretation .
that must be the aging difference .
if you come to this , yes ?
you can show me , i was there .
this is just the minimum .
we can regain our nutrients back .
anyone know what three seconds are ?
on the book and on the image .
this picture reminded me of something .
i find them off .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
i want to prove it to you .
it was a pretty destiny project .
this is the sun going on .
this affects the stores .
this rivers are taking rivers .
a has these benefits and risks .
our newspapers are read by millions .
lego made it possible for everybody .
privacy isn &apos;t there for debate .
they were genetically engineered .
i am the definitely doctor .
i don &apos;t take the same lost one .
baseball is full of great statistics .
because we live on a water planet .
do we really want to go in this direction ?
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
this gave them a evolutionary advantage .
and these are the neural structures .
they didn &apos;t give the government .
oh , my time is over ?
something is going on inside me .
well , that &apos;s not right .
so we measured his movement .
this is a picture of the object .
apparently it was pretty popular .
you see something fun here .
i really like a nice clothing .
he can only use his eyes .
but the truth is far away .
you can do it all the time .
so this crazy story could be true .
who would ever want to wish ?
the defect would be too simple .
her father died shortly after birth .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a cents .
we need to slow down the complexity .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
here &apos;s her marble gang .
it should be the experience .
but then they really want to deep inside .
you want to orient in the museum ?
that was more concrete .
okay , you really want to know ?
and i had to go out of the city .
we won some prices .
who doesn &apos;t want to healthier children ?
it makes leukemia for children .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
then we get this whole feedback .
no , i &apos;m really serious .
i hold it in my hand .
and the goal is very simple .
i shoot my sleeve .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
we have something that doesn &apos;t grow .
now i see greg moon .
a billion people are starving today .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
i loved myself from that fish .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and this sounds very different from before .
he was already over semis .
i started an institutional institute .
they even get funded with one .
the film hasn &apos;t been provided yet .
we need to think about what marks are .
what do you do with that ? &quot;
i call this the radiant .
we &apos;ve been playing for 1994 .
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
this is ideology , not science .
and that brought me like this .
today , 6.8 billion people .
very simple , it will come .
it &apos;s busy making sense .
the hot days today .
automatically goes to the right idea .
so these are the natural things .
but it requires a lot of planning .
we can reinvent everything else .
in a sense , we think about north .
and it depends on phosphorus .
it &apos;s often in the third .
it &apos;s longer than those other networks .
the stones are colored .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
it &apos;s about changing values .
i started with my usual talk .
this is a very sensitive question .
i learned this from my grandmother .
now we do it with airplanes .
how do i get her away ? &quot;
we didn &apos;t write these app .
and every morning i jump on it .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
these are more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
it &apos;s very good .
what words would you describe ?
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
there are also world record .
ask , what is the right thing ?
people are talking about the urine .
i don &apos;t know who knows what .
the surviving spirits .
they gave her blood pressure .
thank you , but the best thing is coming .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
happy productivity . fantastic !
the result of that was catastrophic .
and everybody in this room must be in .
here &apos;s the olive oil .
bjign sundin .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
we &apos;ve already had a lot of procedure .
this may be transmitted .
my brother stared at me .
these are the apas saras .
i talked a lot about magic .
who could have imagined it all ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who do you really want to inform with this ?
completely targeted .
what do you think it &apos;s going to happen next ?
they have . they always have .
so this is a tough disk .
it &apos;s continuous .
they literally switched the lever .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
most of all , when he died .
so it creates two circles .
the byproduct is clean water .
this sounds very unusual .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you lose selfish animals .
she &apos;s going to touch her deeply .
he died , broken through the history .
here you see how the building works .
they went through each other .
say what you feel .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
let &apos;s make a little footprint .
here you have this little mechanism .
there it is .
the interest is what you care about .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
the students are given to notes .
these things are logically correct .
and here you feel it already .
for me , the energy fell in here .
i tried to understand them .
all of these generations need is just a few milliseconds .
and no one seems to be mindful about it .
that i had written these crazy things .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
this is also a paradigm shift .
a dalmatiner , exactly .
you can see from the back of the front .
so from modern society to the computer society .
and that &apos;s what they do .
we have to come a long way , fast .
it &apos;s about a new supply of america .
they &apos;re all embarrassing questions .
these are the mobile phones in the future .
they are the healthier countries .
we are running through initiatives .
now look at this curve .
widows are just belong to our lives .
i stayed in death cells .
they were inspired by us .
maybe some mutations .
so scott gets this frustration .
we worked down to the night .
so i came up with my gut .
he moved back to the silence .
now we saw the reverse effect .
wooden is all applaud .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
so ... so , not that optimistic .
it switches the operations .
let &apos;s start with the true .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
they had a concept of blue blood .
i thought everybody could do that .
i never met him personally .
even cats are looking at this video .
there was jimmy .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
how do you describe your brand ?
we talk about cows , fresh .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
no , that was what i thought .
i &apos;m a redundant person .
that &apos;s not the route .
this is a painting of a circle .
the roof was also covered with water .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
and women argued it successfully .
we can support them to be good .
look at what she &apos;s doing .
the headman to me .
sexual reproduction is coming into the picture .
i &apos;ll read you the post .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
that &apos;s the truth . i believe it .
we &apos;re talking about squeezing it .
it was really profound .
he shocked his head , no .
this is going to happen in april in april .
we also have very accurate data .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but with the right design , please .
we can support them to be good .
just to say , what is information ?
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
there &apos;s never been a time before .
and even lomborg thinks .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what happens ?
and also , these frames are underlying :
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
this is an ecological network .
&quot; this is success , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot;
the chef had checked it .
you put it in a box .
this is such a trajectory .
the thing that had just been represented .
what takes five thousand milliseconds ?
i see the dalmatina .
it may take , until it &apos;s invited .
you might have to get back to that again .
no , no , no .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
156 nations send our television channel .
they tap their internet connection .
but today we are far beyond that .
she wasn &apos;t drunk .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
this is the system that we live in .
but i was looking at these questions .
and that was what i felt .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
you want to wish your desires .
something very strange happens here .
and that was the breakdown as a result .
i learned some very simple things .
it can know how to hold it .
so it creates a feedback loop .
boston has not just a tutor center .
this is a little app .
this is from another place .
&quot; you didn &apos;t let go . &quot;
i lived in parallel worlds .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and i &apos;d like to read you the front .
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
you can be logically and intuitive .
tell me a little bit about this part .
make it possible -- all of you here .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
does anybody know what that is ?
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
it &apos;s called &quot; jump with me . &quot;
let me tell you a little bit about it .
in this kind of circumstance , we don &apos;t exist .
we &apos;ll come back to those people later .
we can give ourselves something like this .
so the first exciting primate .
and there &apos;s evidence .
daniel kahneman : sure .
everybody would like to make happy people happier .
it also plays a role .
and why ? intelligent food changed .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
we have now in this country .
not even the truth is that it &apos;s free .
because now you can use a three-sentence .
you see the timeline .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
we don &apos;t know exactly why it happens .
but it &apos;s not just the words .
thank you , danny kahneman .
we get an absolutely flat line .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
because we don &apos;t want to go around ?
we don &apos;t want companies .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
you run the process , you understand it .
there are some things that need to come together .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
bad ? i was completely confused .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and then he can walk through .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
his personal identity of the erosion .
i &apos;m trying to make this happen in an example .
it has to work only as a present .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
this is a year &apos;s water flow .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
so , little-heated .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
they grow five centimeters .
maybe i did it with good reason .
&quot; a pale dot . &quot;
now let &apos;s bring something different .
it &apos;s all coming out of our own pockets .
ordinary people are not accessible . &quot;
as an artist , the context is very important .
here you see roberto dance .
and no matter , italy won the end of it .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
but the game is a shape-shifting .
thank you . i have a question .
he had 20 minutes of real music .
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
this is just an insurance method .
it should contain the two elements .
shake the environment , make less waste .
but i &apos;ll get to that in the same way .
yes . don &apos;t discover anything else as discover .
the goal of the film is transparency .
a language is the expression of the human mind .
it was a groupers .
what you need is a new medical culture .
alone , complain and with no support .
do you want to listen and listen to listening ? &quot;
i think our identity is threatened .
many of my mandatory is very young .
my cousins went all over the place .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
here are two different jews .
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i have it on my laptop . &quot;
i &apos;m going to negotiate directly with the artists .
it &apos;s a very cool lip .
the difference will be perceived as loss .
in two hours , it &apos;s built all over the place .
the emergency staff moved all the strands .
no insurance can make himself .
there &apos;s a lot of great books to this topic .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputer .
this country is different from 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of slave family .
you can predict that . why is that ?
what kind of application do i do ?
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
isn &apos;t that the half or a quarter ? &quot;
so what can we get from all of this ?
so basically , a translation of translation .
no tree is carbon neutral .
and on and on , you see him now .
the next step is now within this communities .
he had uploaded a lot of every natural videos .
this is just the stitution .
two minutes later , three things happened .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so , he &apos;s here . exactly .
it really solves the fucking problem .
and ecologically it was a disaster .
this is one , part of her .
it just didn &apos;t come out , you know ?
in other areas -- the world of communication .
this is my supermarket . no big one .
but western governments are also helping themselves .
sleep deprivation is ubiquitous .
i &apos;m going to be tired , like all of us .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
if you burn coal , no .
say there &apos;s no predictor .
can you play them now in blue ?
no , we realize what &apos;s inside .
and there &apos;s a central point here .
you know , everybody &apos;s eating cake .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
what are now , in fact , archaic models ?
and the list can be continued to create endless .
so , that was my primarily motivation .
get out of america . find out more .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we asked everybody , and nobody knew it .
my mom called me a few minutes later .
monday : color is something completely powerful .
it &apos;s been kind of frightening .
and then it looks like this .
do you remember the windmill ?
so help me a little bit of it .
imagine mozart being efficient .
i &apos;m pleased to be there .
the water drops itself .
they care about the worse .
man 3 : i &apos;m the shame guy .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a lift .
now , the instruments have evolved .
i want to just explain to you a little bit .
actually didn &apos;t want to make viral video .
there are three sentences in this part of three sentences .
you know about three-and-a-half school .
you can zoom out very easily and zoom out .
now i added a bass .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
if not , anybody else today .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
they laughed more than that .
their problem is that they have too little .
three : escalation of expectation .
the official dogma of what ?
they just start talking , and then they start talking .
let me show you how they work .
it &apos;s a game called folding .
i call them &quot; the last billion . &quot;
we &apos;re thinking of energy today .
that &apos;s what thank you . thank you .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
you go around and you get amused .
you just have to spread as far as you can .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
this is something that is built in the city .
second time . the end of the game time .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
just imagine that for a moment .
raise your hands . let me see .
maybe we can see jokes as change .
dumb is not much better .
people suffer . people were fighting .
and let them start with an example .
you know , science is not a company .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so , this really blew me up .
i tried to preserve the body .
life hasn &apos;t changed since centuries .
but for so many years , there was a lot of help .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
my fourth technology : predictions for complexity .
the third technology : categorization .
it &apos;s a thousand square miles .
you can go to two rather than -- very simple .
you should tell me something about my brand .
it was something we knew to do .
but reality is always unpredictable .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
donesday : confidence is the key .
they are in the back part of our body .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
i wanted to rebuild the health of a disease .
now , if you think a little bit further .
what ? that really blew me out .
we see intelligent food changing food .
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
we forced them . puff .
my parents are at 80 on the fersen .
and there are layers of problems .
it &apos;s the most powerful human quality .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
you can jump directly to a particular envelope .
you can immerse in a certain year .
because this is a demonstration of it , right ?
shatter the environment , less energy .
that &apos;s what &apos;s called osit-model .
now look at the almatina .
and the two last people are here today .
yeah , i &apos;m scared of all these things .
this has to go all the way down , zero .
i didn &apos;t get discouraged .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
astonishingly , he was still delicious .
and over time , they can react to different .
our goal was to just say , okay .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go on again .
all of it is compound of it .
it &apos;s all in it , it &apos;s useful .
that &apos;s going to be in a second in china .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
anyway , they do that in the middle .
the permanent ice is covered with red .
and if not , your dance is still in your dance .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
my mother asked us to raise her hand .
seriously -- the bottom line is .
now , this cartoon makes some of these cartoons .
here &apos;s a few on the hamptons .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
i thought i could integrate myself .
we still think they &apos;re originally originally .
the three words laugh : do you remember ?
i remember that when it was yesterday .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
well , i checked on the court .
i said , &quot; ok , oma . &quot;
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition .
i work in solar technology .
and let me show you a simple example .
but it has an unexpected twist .
so that made sense , it was fit together .
yet we seem to be quite satisfied .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
scott was signed by man .
and here &apos;s every piece of content very well .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
is it about the details or the colors ?
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
no one has to add ideas to it .
motors , motors -- four possibilities .
i think maybe i &apos;ve heard more hands .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
eeee ! no , thank you .
and this is a million-concert .
so in this place , we need digital security systems .
so again , the most appropriate together .
the internet and services are a miracle .
there &apos;s sexuality in many different forms .
so they get rid of it ; they save the shoes .
this is about one percent of the population .
we &apos;ve been here for 130,000 years .
what we want to do is create the future .
i &apos;m in real life of this feedback .
there &apos;s a lot of lucky coaching .
let me show you about the close .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
shame . blame .
we got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
they were just like people in this room .
my grandparents put these number down to 70 .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
we need to do more for the research .
there &apos;s every footprint .
i would normally take the needle now .
there &apos;s somebody sitting in the back who had no childhood .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
let &apos;s do this as a machine here .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
this is going to be a key element of that toolbox .
they live with chemosynthesis .
i was totally enthusiastic , you know .
now i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
and every night , they fly 40 miles back .
every morning they fly 40 miles to the farm .
how is the forage ? &quot;
natural light then offers himself to smarter .
that &apos;s how no one &apos;s ever done in the world .
picasso , wait , wait .
we &apos;re creating new tensions and conflicts .
that the theme of ecology is global .
now i &apos;m going to do some more important stuff .
you &apos;re all now on your way back .
and they had to remove what we did .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
initially , we just signed .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
that &apos;s how you can &apos;t get them wrong .
what do you do with certificate ?
this is alfred gonz .
there can be some order of changes .
and this is very important in medical research .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
what would you tell someone who believes ?
then he whispered me to the ear .
the rest of the time is october .
i start with some simple examples .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
the question is , why do people accept that ?
and i went back to work .
it &apos;s being connected by oxygen and silicon .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
then i wonder : how could this happen ?
first of all , i thought it would be a game .
the storytelling always needs more senses .
and try this all over again with another generation .
today , a lot of people have given the government .
next week , the market is coming up .
she &apos;s got a button .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the introduction .
the first is a classic , apple .
it &apos;s as i would like to be .
these things have a positive effect .
no one wanted to do anything with the film .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
on the left , you see a little boat .
so i think we need to be leaders .
so we have this terrible idea .
so two pairs , every baby .
ladies and gentlemen , their relatives .
it &apos;s the only test of survival and success .
the teachers didn &apos;t know something was changed .
it was the imagination of the imagination .
but the best part comes in -- one second .
so each concert is a different concert .
so not saving , avoided , avoid .
and everything is packaging or content .
i could just stand right in front of my house . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
she supports other people talking about their mistakes .
i made them and i took care of the treatment .
do you know how to call a 400ter ?
notice two things about this curve .
and i have to say , there was power .
my mother was the youngest of her kids .
at 16 , i started to illustrate books .
that our contribution to the system is vote .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
he hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
i never want to make a difference in life .
so i spoke a few months later on a conference .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- this is how their fingers work .
i just want to show you a little bit here .
and of course , it &apos;s made click .
it was summer and i had abroad .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
and they &apos;re not just going to die of masks .
what happened is that we could do it .
they &apos;re not investing in power .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
these are absolutely logical and correct .
anyway . that &apos;s what i want to do anyway .
technically , there &apos;s just as much as possible .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for nine .
i &apos;ve got him here in particular .
at the beginning of the tribal society through language .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
so it &apos;s to go from outside to human beings .
we don &apos;t make identity , we invent it .
it was a lot of los angeles .
and i &apos;m going to summarize this for you .
now everyone &apos;s trying to figure out something out of this pattern .
he came to me and hugged me .
all of them were so , they started sharing .
but it &apos;s definitely not a very optimal situation .
i &apos;m really sorry . does that make it crazy ?
the land on land would roll them up .
so smart smart , a big issue everywhere .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
i learned very simple things in my work .
we want to do something against death penalty .
there &apos;s a couple of interesting developments .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet , a realistic level .
so for the subject of the day , financial saving .
in fact , no , it wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
and we need to improve a lot of this device .
it came out four and a half years ago .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
this is a problem that many players have .
the last three of the five was summarized .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecology model .
memory these things , strip the rest .
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
all right , what is the brand gerry ?
i want to help you calm down .
both of them are overwhelmed , both of them .
as i said , amanda , our elephant .
there was no talotfish melting .
have you taken all your vitamins this morning ?
so that was a very strange experience .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
all of these windshields are all over the place .
information is a difference that makes a difference .
the only thing they had was their head .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
this is a dead turtle .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
i have something that i want to show you .
how would it be longer to live in good health ?
we don &apos;t want companies to patent .
and that &apos;s what i found incredibly exciting .
you &apos;ve got the flow of water .
so , we can &apos;t do these things .
in the countries where people are getting money .
and what about that ?
we understood that the weather is global .
and in this head , memory was remembered .
you saw it in the news .
this is an entirely unsustainable pattern .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
everybody in my neighborhood is home .
that means we need to get phosphorus back to phosphorus .
well , would you choose the same vacation ?
there seems to be an imbalance .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
we did it in the last 1,000 years .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
now she understood the advantage of &quot; prototyping . &quot;
it &apos;s the u.s. for hundreds of years .
i think first of all , the curiosity .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
these were the first calculations of six years ago .
but maybe you can disagree with them .
but today , we &apos;re only talking about biological systems .
not all should be compound .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
and we see that it goes through .
because we don &apos;t feel money .
yeah , so what should biosecurity be ?
here are some people who test it .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
there &apos;s a lot of spatial things .
the corporate headquarters are right here .
i thought he had kidney stones .
and feedback back to my doctor .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
we want to reduce the number of prisoners .
the silence is oid .
the dutch dna was an interesting step .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
but what happens to &quot; spoken &quot; is different .
i was not familiar with the chain .
no apple has ever been thrown like this .
good night , sweet thylacine . &quot;
now he &apos;s going to take a tractor in the scene .
and they feel their movements and their mood .
if your job is dancing , dance .
so we made about 50 of the magnet .
these are images of a duration of six seconds .
but netherlands is not always such a bad thing .
in our own countries , we would never do anything like this .
they &apos;re getting rare because we &apos;re going to catch them .
so you &apos;re not going to lose income in a lot .
all of these things are inevitable .
we have access to exponential technology .
i remember it when it was yesterday .
and i &apos;m going to become a character in the book .
tell , &quot; please this process . &quot;
so every trunk was a little different .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
i put my job on 95 .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
we found that it really moves .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
the answer is likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
because otherwise our problem would be bigger .
this is something like our camping .
that &apos;s how you can move the whole movement .
these are the results that we just got right now .
but how do you do that in practice ?
and it &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
i don &apos;t want to achieve it by doing it . &quot;
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
this is the problem i try to solve .
this is not about how happy a person lives .
and you ask , what happens to those moments ?
... also , the dosiles play a role .
probably many of you here in the room probably know this trick .
yes , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk salk .
well , i understand that . i do .
the marshmallow must be on top .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
these blocks are not making us money .
i can run the sequence while they &apos;re going .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
for nathaniel , music means abundant health .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
because , in fact , this person is not really interested in evidence .
because we can &apos;t live without these liability .
he &apos;s just kidding , and not himself .
why do i have to afford that little car ?
a phrase with its own breath .
the interpretation is barely spoken in the beginnings .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
and in my adolescence , i said expectation .
it &apos;s sort of a stick of smallpox .
the whole thing is a game , i have to tell you .
or they didn &apos;t have any photo gray tography .
and that leads us to a big question .
they virtually virtual reality and without computers .
yes , what kind of projects we &apos;re doing now ?
and the world in which we lived like this .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
if you generalize it , it happens .
and this was not a hard diagnosis .
i was a 20 obsessional student .
all right , really good , maybe a star .
wealth , not debt , affecting the outcome .
she had the last word in every family street .
the transition . we can feel it .
and we use this word with these contempt .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and it worked . it worked out for scott .
i met the decision to go to the u.s .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
and finally , we should be transparency .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
or are they more like a downlover ?
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
so what are we going to see in the movie ?
you know , i had an idea for a movie .
i want to tell you how we found this .
and that &apos;s the planning behind levels .
i learned that everything else is different .
every polberg has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
look , dr. kekeen has changed .
it &apos;s natural gas and it &apos;s just natasha .
we have the passion of a innovator .
this is moore &apos;s law &apos;s last hundred years .
thank you for ted . thank you .
we want to create an incarceration . &quot;
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
now we do it with drills and machines .
this is the call center for service and information .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
we have all the navigation systems in our cars .
but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
you knew it was a trick , right ?
all right , let me show you a little more of it .
here we were , and this is the painting .
emmanuc : &quot; embrace transparency &quot;
there were a lot of crazy things going on .
from the federal age to the inferior age age .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same in disabled movement .
but are we going to make the best out of our game ?
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
you &apos;re expecting an extra billion players in the next decade .
but one of them is worse than the other .
but you know what they don &apos;t have right ?
i thought we &apos;re going to bring the poker ape .
there is a connection , a respectful respect .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
so my two passions flew .
you do something which is actually slightly different .
i had over a couple of months .
i don &apos;t know who knows this picture .
i just agree . that &apos;s logically logically .
it seems to me that i think is important .
the question of death is an interesting question .
the child in me is really thrilled .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
al is a hydrant in the city .
today i &apos;m going to go from unexpected discoveries .
the submarine part comes from a stone .
when i say reality , i get my real reality .
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
and how was that for you ? what is it successful ?
a little bit more about you , that &apos;s not you .
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
tuesday : adapting to be totally overrated .
the dog ! i was amazed .
do you want to become more attractive and more confident ?
she was barely run and blue .
the people in the side rooms are now .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and some of it has worked and mankind doesn &apos;t work .
so we &apos;re running away , and where are we going ?
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
we wanted to develop a tool for language learning .
i may have been working for another 40 years .
now , you know what the answer to this question ?
if you want to make hyperlinks between the images .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not perceived as a big loss .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
this is the kind of educational scholars .
and luckily , there &apos;s a lot of studies now .
we learn to trust and the rules of play .
probably one of these numbers has to come close to zero .
and i said , &quot; yeah , very much . &quot;
you can say things that have impact around the world .
... , please , just show the slide .
likewise , i think we &apos;re going to do a games today .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the aid doctor .
and i went over and just listened to .
it also shows up on other places of the book .
let me show you an example of what i mean .
another favorite picture of me , night after night .
these results have been achieved by several weeks of work .
this player right now is a episode of episode .
why do i do that ? what comes out ? &quot;
there &apos;s a program that might be familiar with .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
you know , he was here in 1835 .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibility of that yet .
my mother suffered from the boat from the boat .
these are the people that shape my world view .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to anymore .
we see this in all sorts of human life .
and just as it was after the three months .
it &apos;s right , morality .
the main problem here is similar to aids .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any statement about reality .
have a nice example of that .
then i say heart failure , yes ?
and we often want to reinvent the way we want to do .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing children to the world .
his whole workplace has changed after that .
i said , &quot; promise , oma . &quot;
these are invertebrate programs and strange programs .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
there are some places that we can turn to .
we called it the digital water of maxlion .
because they have special skills of processing .
so here are some natural fireflies .
the second factor are the services that we use .
and so my way of doing films is completely changed .
it &apos;s hard to overrank the destruction .
so you could feel like you could sell it .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
that means that the ants weigh a lot more than we do .
and we can look at this now .
shah and pray of leonard cohen .
so they go ahead and they start to invent them .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
this is an idea worth spreading .
so just imagine two other small changes .
how many would choose a good memory ?
and that &apos;s how bible message the message .
so listen to you , if a music is played .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any statement about what is true .
the first two sentences that are logically correct .
in fact , we know that something else is the case .
now this should not be a joke , but it should be .
do that , and then you learn the sentence .
we can do these things at different points .
what we love is , it &apos;s a very peaceful living .
they moved to a natural alistic concept .
so these women met , and they were just talking .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and we &apos;ve designed an app .
daring leaks and sponsored workers .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzle puzzles .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you zoom in . you can actually go inside .
you can see in all these museums here .
how much money is going to need to save that ?
think about it . this attack is generic .
and if not , there &apos;s nothing wrong about it .
so we &apos;re starting with a windows dryer .
he says , &quot; willingness to make it all . &quot;
imagine a soundscape .
it &apos;s a totally blurry of errors .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to continue to evolve .
this is another view of the tree of life .
they shared the kingdom in two halfway .
this is one of the classic expressions in playing .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
we had no paralysis in this country yesterday .
and i &apos;ve used a while to find out that .
we repeated this exercise with the same student .
you have to be willing to take risks .
&quot; look at your stomach , pink .
there &apos;s no overpopulation problem with trees .
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
and the third area that actually explains itself .
i &apos;m looking forward to all of you .
each big picture is the beginning of an advance .
you wouldn &apos;t want to starve , and you know what ?
or are they rather like a downtown attribute ?
the next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
this is the consequence that we need to face .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
play is the kitt that keeps us both .
if you have something , you give it to .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
they teach them to open themselves .
onyms : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
and here are two patients . these are their records .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
i think that &apos;s true for everyone on the planet .
those who make scientific argument are very little .
so , a climate change will be terrible for you .
i &apos;ll just show you the new york times website .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as designers .
clean coal , they &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
but the volume are much larger than ever before .
it grows in the winter and shrinking in summer .
not only bad , but the worst ever .
everybody knew your genius was a little bit lovely .
we repair them , repair them .
and the world in which we now look like this .
but these are all roads in the u.s. s.a .
we &apos;re going to dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
child mortality has decreased a tenth .
that &apos;s where the guy comes back again .
ok , something that is half a billion people .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
and you know what my answer to all of this ?
we walk into the poor placebo industry .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
where is the greatest interest , what really do you do ?
and then the energy is very important for you .
we went back to the wreck of the titanic .
because artists have a broken relationship to the lie .
and at all , you &apos;ve got a lot less than i do .
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
i &apos;ll never play as much as this moment .
it &apos;s a reform of fourth behavior , right ?
and less usable or useless is it .
how can i make something a useless friendship ?
i don &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be that .
so how do we work when we get in there ?
every society is shaped by a primarily .
and these interactive portraits are true each other .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fuel generation .
you may have heard that we have made watermarks .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
they get a model that comes from all the earth .
the grandfather refused to refend .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
the only problem with this was that she had 10 children .
so in other words , i definitely want what i want .
and i see the same process combined by photographs .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it was seen this year almost 200 million times .
they had 348 different kinds of markers .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction of that .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
he described one of them as &quot; ordinary &quot; . &quot;
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
on a screen , the screen filled with leaves .
so the trianecology movement has done it .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
this year , it became almost 50 million times .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
the faces of the audience were very serious and emergency .
i love this guy ; his phrase is unaffordable .
we should put the bear in the cage .
are you mining and moneye-7 ?
the life itself has no voice in this choice .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
and there was a sense of everything in the world .
well the next day we were in cleveland .
dane , at a moment of head .
you can look great for less than 50 dollars .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
and no , it &apos;s not a matter of san francisco or san francisco .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open your doors ?
here &apos;s the recent version of this one .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
and that was sort of the first people to play games .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
you never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
i mean , i rarely saw flake lines .
i take this hand . and here &apos;s the knife .
and the film is called &quot; the smartest ever . &quot;
now , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand targets .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
well , we set up the mayor &apos;s mayor .
now today , we know all about where our things come from .
france makes a rich . italy makes a tor .
how do you judge people because of their character ?
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressive .
he stayed five of hope out of my consciousness .
is it possible for others , or is it affecting us ?
so i say , the world changed games !
edward lava is a national scientist .
now we spend three billion hours a week playing with online .
the biggest difference between you is the gang times .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
bg : a energy breakthrough is the most important .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t shake yourself .
with pivot , you can immerse in a decade .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
so i &apos;ve heard a lot of fish in my life .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
in fact , the nodes are very vague and very insecure .
because we don &apos;t do things free .
there &apos;s going to be more of my glasses .
as i said , it &apos;s only started .
this is an interactive filmmaking .
and old-fashioned ! for those of you who are in charge .
i &apos;m going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and everybody knew it worked like this , right ?
i would prefer to do this work that i love .
and the question is , are these good news or bad news ?
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
it says , &quot; look at your fingers every light . &quot;
the next step was to find the apps for this .
we still know one where all of them are .
so you just go to google nuclear project .com .
what other metamorites have you running ?
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other marks .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money trying to look great .
this constant feedback is not in real life .
i &apos;m going to explain it for you and then explain it .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
a research semester , the theme of the research design .
i &apos;m also going to resolve what &apos;s inside .
you know , there &apos;s nothing possible in this gold fish glass . &quot;
and then we offer one of these magnificent dunes .
in the future , most crime are going to play online .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
now it &apos;s on the red list of dangerous species .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
but i really believe that after us , something is coming .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of this communities .
the cellular communities started to abstract information .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital physicist .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the rat rats .
&quot; don &apos;t go &quot; as an untrue .
i didn &apos;t know how to use it .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together .
and also urban designers and blueprint are very interested in .
there &apos;s not even existing online . there &apos;s no anemia .
it doesn &apos;t work for your memories at all .
our steps in digital life were exponentially .
this is star night , never before .
over the course of this journey , i learned a lot .
when i was a kid , i was drawing comic books and so on .
if we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
that &apos;s our goal right now .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
we have only been there in the same way .
many of them are reduced 80 percent by 2050 .
i was pretty much obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
so if there &apos;s no soul , there &apos;s no soul .
this is the hardest part in my talk .
i can &apos;t play it today in 20 years .
both of these cases , i wonder .
so much testosterone , but no reaction to it .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
i &apos;m just going to hold that knife in my head .
1gram is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
that &apos;s why the weighs on how to think .
these are spaces that can respond to a human .
now , how do people die in such a harbor ?
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and you can see that green dot there in the middle .
i sold shots of animals throughout the world .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can turn that around .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio doesn &apos;t know .
no , that &apos;s exactly the right thing , right ?
many of you are covered by faces .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
in both cases , it was operated , and it was very good to them .
she didn &apos;t have any wireless brain damage .
the ethnic sphere is the great empowerment of humanity .
and the fish was lucky to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the numerous language of language .
it was the missing crossing against drugs .
this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
there &apos;s more to it , there &apos;s still deeper .
but we only know a little bit about where things go .
ok , imagine how the extreme self-motivation are to motivate .
i know what people think when they see that .
ask them questions , demand evidence .
i said , &quot; chicken panels ? &quot;
everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
it used to be the kind of thing that happened in the village .
this is what happened to be a machine machine age .
in our country , there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
she feeds her on the beatles machine .
and yet , there is this mental disagreement .
it could happen within a period of time .
... it &apos;s crowd-sourced .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
i worked in a coal mining machine -- dangerous .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there he was rooted and opinion and so ?
that means go back to the criminals .
so like a human being with certain things .
and , of course , how design takes impact on perception .
but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
it &apos;s just breathtaking .
lawyer : i &apos;m a lawyer .
we have a abstract language .
another example is called virtual reality .
but actually , it was a bigger night .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
it was called the &quot; automatic stone . &quot;
dotinar is a certification place .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to do ?
he took a famous photo . what was it ?
it slows down for one of our big problems .
we see the process that self-feed itself .
spectacular ? yes . alive ? yak.
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
but you can do something special about this .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
because the images eat it for them to feel real .
wham and whale , you &apos;re in this museum .
the idea is to overcome a digital security system .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain it .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is great . i love the placebo industry .
in fact , the progress of energy is based on energy .
this was not a film , not a hd , that was real .
i wasn &apos;t there for a long time with miguel .
because , you know , that &apos;s a fun process .
have you ever seen a maneuver tree ?
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i described .
when you get far away , get together . &quot;
providing america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
frog , the carbon man will be cleaned every day .
this is a organism that we described in 1996 .
so i &apos;m going to step back and erase the other way .
i filmed in war areas -- hard and dangerous .
so we should soon figure out what the goal is .
we can do things in the same way with less energy .
when we build cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
in other words , our customers are joking .
can you imagine something good that comes out of tabak ?
there are other pleasures , but that &apos;s dominant .
they were asked to cover all 60 seconds across their pain .
you can just call out some names , and people will understand .
diphin , roman , paralysis ...
this is a version of a thing that was done .
well , the energy rice is over time .
and it was an experience that could not give me hollywood .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening of the movie .
it involves immense jewelry in the control room .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s this tall , it &apos;s cooperative .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
and so he &apos;s going to end his queries .
and then a whole bunch of simulations of simulations .
but it wasn &apos;t that in the years that we had .
the musical instrument is the extension of our bodies .
he &apos;s lived only three-and-a-half years .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
a baby needs some sixth of a windmill .
so i know some of them who didn &apos;t wear .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
in 25 years , it will be gone from here .
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
please follow me because the circle will close again .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s happening here .
this is an idioic debate . it has to stop .
they go to thabo mbeki in south africa .
but then i thought , well , let &apos;s be honest .
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds of them .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
bruno giususi : thank you . thank you .
i got a friend who drives a serati .
it &apos;s not just a nice pete .
and because we &apos;re getting older , we &apos;re going to get bigger .
this is the time period where you fall in love .
and even today , we &apos;re still very , very strong stories .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and the predictions , as you read , are serious .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
and i don &apos;t expect that to be going to change .
it &apos;s also my big , life-long love and fascination .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
why do they care about us if we can &apos;t buy them ?
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
a few years ago , i started to develop littany .
the broader describe it still touches .
my grandfather was in hibition in prison .
she was a day , strong woman , she had impact .
so , in some sense , mapping refers to technology .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
but what if you want to see the paintbrush ?
but my logical side hasn &apos;t liked it either .
i just want to say a little bit about salatine .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . happy wish .
we also brought up to design school as well .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against injustice .
my uncle died of alcohol diseases .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also affordable .
in fact , we &apos;re also a majority community .
what is this new condition that takes the world slow down ?
let &apos;s call it the animal , it costs a lot of money .
if a neighbor helps us strengthen our communities .
ohhhhhh , wowww !
they always worry that they &apos;re losing regallows .
50 percent of their decisions were hit by nine minutes or less .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny chip computer chip .
and my talk today is going to be dominated by these cognitive actions .
well , i play games sometimes , but not very often .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called collecting collections .
open the card , open it up with a click .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a lot about transparency .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
you could also use ordinary worm technology to spread .
one of my friends has made it -- richard bingboingling .
imagine these screening dots could really start flying out .
i smile and i say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
these are the kinds of questions that we need to face .
i was fascinated by the elephant and beauty of biology .
and i can tell you it was a transformative experience .
we need to start changing the real world in a game .
and this is by a economist . so he &apos;s logical .
i mean , how do we go from our memories ?
the more you deserve money , the more you do it .
that all of our survival is linked to every single one .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a pause .
right , yan , the judge has magic forces .
and yes , i have a task , as you may recognize .
secondly , photographs should have the same type of evidence .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
for example , this person would be completely logically accurate .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to get out of it .
i have . the first picture is a picture of my family .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing going in the movie of statements .
and the film is going to be called &quot; the smartest ever . &quot;
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
just that i think it &apos;s like , rather than true .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy it . thank you very much .
but it turns out it &apos;s not all .
i mean , we &apos;re asking : why are we fighting this ?
these are a lot of tode through masks , 20 per hour .
so there should be a better at the beginning of my death .
because they &apos;re the ones who are also experts for flavor .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
i mentioned this to miguel , and he was running .
so the pink system also gets better . &quot;
and then i immediately think that &apos;s unfair .
and even today , what you would think in the mental mind today .
and we can replace oil from other energy sources .
i &apos;m not good enough ; i don &apos;t make it .
like algae -- and other awful things .
i &apos;m not going to tell you it because i want to use it .
it was completely exclusive that it could fail .
so that got me right , and i wanted more .
and immediately i see a different pattern there is error .
yes , this is a little bit down there .
that &apos;s why not our resource efficiency , it &apos;s efficiency .
we &apos;ve been using holland now over three years .
and if possible , i will find some of the weird stuff .
now i know it was the reason for the ocean .
and that was the first time i learned this .
i studied stomach , and she was in breathtaking .
and the time i was collecting more and more knowledge .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 , if a beating 300 beats .
in 2010 , we had just connected under two billion people online .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
and the lighting just through the rest of the book .
&quot; because she has been holding her this morning , &quot; he said .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropes .
this approach is true for everything that we do creative .
since that time , we &apos;ve all been given about recognition .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody in this audience .
now , your life itself is not going to be happier .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
a very specific concrete wish that we invent this technology .
this is a picture of a frozen kentucky .
he &apos;s got a forage of 15 to one .
i can say the canvas is a man .
we &apos;ve moved on to this before , this is what we call the bird crisis .
this is 20 feet tall , as bigger as greenland .
this is the insurance we &apos;ve just finished recently .
somewhere here is a series of photographs -- here they are .
but you can , if you &apos;re in a foreign length .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them good .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t seem to be more human .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
or do you want to be more powerful , more force .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though it &apos;s heard .
my great-grandparents died when they were 60 .
now , where should we go ? what is the right approach ?
this is kind of like the suburbs of delhi .
and of course , it can never give it any more .
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
and the more i talked , the more i should tell .
and i &apos;m celebrating a little kid like a kid .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit everything into my tiny suitcase .
if you &apos;re happy , you attract other happy people .
players are champions in the spiders of social nets .
how can we take these feelings from the reality ?
that &apos;s how it became from the same , bad team under the best .
the fact is that this insecure should be worrying us .
so the people in the west really thought about creativity for a long time .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
a consequence was that the telephone was never broken .
according to its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
a few months earlier , and i had just forgotten everything .
even who kills someone , not just a murderer .
the invention of language was a little step in that direction .
and the next interesting phase is about another billion years .
and this video was actually already in january of january .
each of these subjects , of course , are much smaller decisions .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing time .
today i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
they &apos;re interacting with their surroundings and their experiences .
this trick can lead you to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
you know , there was no mandarin in the paradise .
yes , i &apos;m very pleased to be with you .
everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is the vision .
i apologize that i have to go so much shorter .
secondly , what economists call perfume tuna .
and i think it looks like the world looks like this .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
so it has nothing changed , and yet it has changed everything .
we just crossed the 7th century marke marke .
then let &apos;s inject this analogy in the future .
so , if you can make the light again .
it was a store called drapos .
are you sofar ? you see a little bit nervous .
and when i turn around , the finger changes changes its position .
the things that are only used are going to be used in technical systems .
so the device you see there doesn &apos;t work .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
they did it by irritating the country .
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
welcome the fear . welcome the risk of welcome .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
there &apos;s only the second best , which is the fire department .
they can swallow them , where they go and stand .
an amazing error . one in nine of innocent school innocent .
and i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually going to be a roller .
this is somebody who is safe in the remaining four out of 10 .
we &apos;re used to thinking that things happen .
i had a 14-year-old boy when i was a mandela .
they &apos;re in the middle , they want to end up in the end of the gangs .
and then people could eat this , and they wouldn &apos;t be blinded .
because this is where the actual government work is happening .
&quot; 2.5 to one thing ? what do you feed ? &quot;
and then we started negotiating insulin .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
i play explaining what those notes could mean .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re helping to ask for people .
but even our perception , as you fake us , too .
and some other example are the ambitious systems , intelligent systems .
how many doors have the house that you live in ?
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s also pretty good .
i believe that , and i feel that we should teach .
and i estimate that many of you have done that too .
some people were disappointed that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
i sent them home without talking to my doctor .
the cost of solar energy drops in the last 50 percent .
we need to be in the machine administration .
there is a direct spinal cord system for this .
the monkey of software in the rule takes me a few years .
and sure , we can find fast food chain .
cats are looking at cats that are watching this video .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
and what happened is that i needed a experts .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned electric language .
i wish i could only see children growing up .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
it has eye view of life , one after another .
and i surpassed them to finance a expedition .
we &apos;re talking about the flow of information flow .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering collection .
it &apos;s the first half of its value .
well , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
so they &apos;re moving around and doing art installations like this .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you &apos;ve got to protect it . &quot;
i was shocked and i was inside of the inside .
i walked through the emergency room on my way home .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
i say that because i think identity is very important .
because all these new technologies are coming from themselves to feed .
because her life depended on whether she did the right .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
i knew she was going to be abandoned .
today we don &apos;t just find a little bit of genius .
a typical walmart is offering you 100,000 products today .
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you right now is what truly amazing .
for example , it was about finding features .
he said he didn &apos;t ask . he will ask him questions .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought in .
if it wasn &apos;t moving more , you would dig it .
wouldn &apos;t you want to make changes in your genes ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
again , what potential would we like to call ?
i &apos;m saying we are ready for our own epic game .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , two reasons .
if we looked at how feelings relate to the income .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
there was no christmas trees . we did it all .
and we should not . our healthcare system is it .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
look at miguel , like mimiguel .
the depending on a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals ?
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not sure .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the photograph was actually put together .
the words , as long as his friends , now of his own .
and what we found was that there was a relationship .
do you know how many decisions you make on a typical day ?
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
so the driving force is the cyber -- superpower .
i didn &apos;t spend my wife with my wife two years .
the pilot ran out of the hudson river .
the revelation is the death of life .
that keeps us in the constant and makes us evolve .
but there was always a cycle of life in their presentation .
it &apos;s about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
you can see the person who asks what &apos;s inside .
i &apos;ve got two hives on most of my own .
it turns out that dna synthesization is very difficult .
we know that money is very important , goals is very important .
we think about our future as forgiveness memories .
well , the memorial itself is a storyteller .
what it had ruined was the memories of the experience .
we &apos;re going to meet in the next few days .
there &apos;s a doctor there .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
a fish , but also a bird reserve .
this second fish , this is another kind of love story .
the first one that was more like an passionate monkey .
he &apos;s very happy about this because he &apos;s disappointed them .
because the music is a language , and language is a language to communicate .
and first of all , to ask what is the right thing .
but i do it just a little bit curious about it .
i started thinking , i should just put the project on it .
we can naturally look at the issue of mosquito .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of platform .
if you don &apos;t do that , someone can take it away .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
only to prepare tivations in time , they agreed .
if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
so you can ask : how happy is the living self ?
most of them are completely ignored by the memory itself .
don &apos;t tell me that these things have no consequences .
has one single audience in the audience ever die of masks ?
it &apos;s the question to ask if you can get it to zero .
you like to test it after my talk in your immune system .
but it is , of course , the sum is very , very diverse ideas .
and she asked him , what &apos;s your hobbies ?
so that , in every shop , you can get things back .
so the question is , how do we deal with those windmills ?
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
so , for example , shy the environment , less car .
and the lives lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
so if i borrow them side by side , that &apos;s what you &apos;re interested in .
am i looking at it as if i could write a song ?
she said it would be like a thursday air .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
they &apos;re putting a blue blue on a green one , and they can make light .
but you don &apos;t notice the previous comprehension .
these images are extraordinary because the transition goes very fast .
yet , we &apos;re still on the galapagos islands .
more and more people came in because they were angry , they were angry .
it was the fear of terror , the life of her life .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
we have a lot of cells that are no longer on their own .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it much later .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
but where would the next aed be to help this patient ?
you have to make 62 different decisions to create your car completely .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go like that .
almost as we would prepare our lives to prepare .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my ego .
i was the only one who could talk to the aircraft .
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
think of it as a screening , as a flying point .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
this is an amazing adventure that you &apos;re talking about .
the politics is going to change , i think , in the coming years .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
they evaporate their urine . they almost never .
usually most people are beginning to orient themselves from the task .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges you have to imagine .
and interestingly , bono is also a prize winner .
if you walk , yes , every footprint will destroy the ground .
if we exaggerate it , we can remove a little bit back .
the most powerful mining workers is the head of massey .
this is the most coal in west virginia .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a book .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will only be worse .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
because through marine protected areas , we &apos;re basically restoring the past .
i want to close with a story that really triggered me .
sometimes i lose the balance . a story to conclude .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
so now we &apos;ve added the time-lapse .
so today , evolution can happen in the time period of microseconds .
here he picks a rare weighs .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
we could reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i &apos;m probably not going to be able to take all of you on this journey .
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
car colors , color of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
they don &apos;t get me out of the museums .
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
i really like your art , sergey in . now .
i became part of the wonder of that day .
it &apos;s called eyeballs , and you can see the description .
this is the average size of a greenland ice sheet .
i mean , what does anyone do with so many outfits ?
and as a general term , we can use the word &quot; sexuality . &quot;
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
we all need to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
let &apos;s call him miguel . in fact , he &apos;s called miguel .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to go in the first pile .
then the same happens in a good , talking about conversation .
i have to tell you , i think it was a big mistake .
we take pictures of these mini-big bang into detectors .
economists call this a paragraph of improvement .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what enabled us to modern progress .
the freedom to maximize is too maximized .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
this is a whole book , an example of non-verbal data .
and of course we share all the same adaptation .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in the event of inotar .
there are cases of intact .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just coming out of our heads .
i want to help you with a very particular aspect of curiosity .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
ceos are a little bit more about the average , but here it will be interesting .
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
this is a proof that men are not pigs .
this deputy ran over the older black hole .
i don &apos;t know how embodied people will be .
you go to the block and take it as a revelation .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the room .
bonobos are related to our nearest living rooms .
the first of these is a contradiction of complexity .
they invest a lot of their time in the growing structure of growing structures .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , as little as it &apos;s supported .
normally , you &apos;re just kind of standing there and some other people don &apos;t .
now he mentioned the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
i take the audience of the audience , or unconsciously .
you feel that &apos;s the actual truth behind the shelter .
but the question i want to ask is : why not ?
and the best part is what is expected in the realm of health .
this is the technology supported innovation that &apos;s available today .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , painful .
wr want to help people who have been convicted .
and that means free access to being open and productive .
how did he come to search for this particular kind of help ?
let &apos;s jump back to the moma , again in new york .
tempt will be part of the show , which is pretty rejected .
we produce androgen and we &apos;re talking about genes .
and if you do it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this is scandals and we should be ashamed .
and this is the value of this experience , this very simple exercise .
but as they talked to different people around the world , they talked about these possibilities .
they have an renewable energy from five percent today .
and they did that with so-called leady maps .
but the crucial thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so i &apos;ve been busy looking at what &apos;s intuitive or intuitive .
and these are just the biohackers , the individual people .
it means that we are reaching a cultural impact on the scientific impact .
this made me feel like i wanted to share my jeans .
he invited the king from sideam to dinner .
but somehow , we do it , from this problem of absence .
and this is also what i had last half-year .
but instead of being in panic , he just stopped .
how about contribution that we can &apos;t even predict ?
if you look at the people who have to do it .
and guess what we found in the attack ?
imagine that every single person is being controlled by people .
okay , let me just squeeze a little bit of blood for you .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
new investments , in order to create good jobs .
6 : social fall . in 7 , 65 : 65 dead .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with me like this and play .
that means that the player saves safely three of 10 strokes .
a long time ago , there were horrible whales -- 500 years ago .
so many of you will say , these are crazy ! that &apos;s good .
the x-ray interpretation of a piece is comparable .
from my eye view , i saw the master champion and off .
fireflies all the time in a glass , i always found very exciting .
this picture , for example , has about 10 billion points , i think .
so i decided , when i was 15 , i would become a diver .
here &apos;s a little bit larger . we look right at the center right here .
and within a few years , lego in every household .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
by the way , i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a lawyer .
and i want to show you my outfits for this week .
56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t come out of court .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-esteem .
i asked him how to become a fish experts .
there were the core republic of lepollination .
from that time , an anecdote that you may be familiar with .
no longer needed to whistle or sing a song .
and sixty-10 seconds , a very exciting phenomenon .
this goes back a lot more to the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
so i think it &apos;s a very un-hack .
i think there &apos;s something like this , or something like that .
it actually has only five thousand real forms , these networks .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
so this looks like a basketball plaque .
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
i could not have been able to do it better . i don &apos;t have left me .
well , in fact , the number of violent crimes has not changed very much .
i first ate him in a restaurant in southern spain .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
it was so inspiring , so refugee .
the death penalty in america is defined by wrong .
turned the trash pitch on the site . go home .
just this airport has an area of 100 square miles away .
i like things that are weird . i like odd things .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
so maybe you should give up a little bit of this . &quot;
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leader .
here &apos;s an excerpt from that attack -- code .
we &apos;ve made his bed so that he can see outside .
we degrade a man who has a value for our society .
we use a games to escape the real world .
we hate to hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have a trust in the system .
what about paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : it &apos;s .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
this is actually the real melting of man and machine .
a few . probably about how many creative people there are here .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
it produced the highest construction in the slightest time .
in the average , it &apos;s about five tons of space on the planet .
i grew up with a high school science fiction .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re going to build siv , not intensive .
so there was a company that tried to do it right .
the component is becoming more and more to the friend with which you live together .
and i &apos;m not really sure whether they really stay in time .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little trip .
there was , i think , a very good coding .
in fact , nasa showed that there are many of them out there .
they like to increase the paralysis and the satisfaction .
now , i wondered how can i actually get this over ?
it &apos;s an independent area . they all control minerals .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view of the world .
somebody had broken , and the system was founded .
photos like this : a building downstairs along a lot of road .
the biggest fear they had pirate pipes , rape and death .
so it &apos;s very difficult to get out of all these extensions .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange landscape .
but besides it , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
i brought seven of them down , and that &apos;s all .
but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position .
our gut is a wonderful hospitable environment for these bacteria .
well , the two kinds of mind itself is two terms of happiness .
well , life itself is alive .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of happiness under the research .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mimic .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
ah , the majority . i like to see that as a doctor .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s 2,500 years back .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
now , what does this have to do with placebo effect ?
smallpox . the poles have killed billions of people on this planet .
these are the renewables , as they &apos;re often called them .
this is a fish up in the southwestern corner .
since i ask , how convenient was that diagnosis ?
the notized notes have the function of the letter of a script .
then these are the supplies of the pre-industrial cultures .
that &apos;s called navigating navigation and rhythm .
so that &apos;s only one application that you can do with it .
and then we &apos;ve got a cootype that &apos;s how it works .
at the last ted conference i gave a introduction to the lhc .
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
this is what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
54 percent of deaths through drills .
basically , the concrete block has become the block of our time .
it would be like a new sentence , never before .
how can a judge turn into someone who is not ?
in many areas , people had to be scared of lyncs .
so programs that can be found on the husband &apos;s licenses .
for example , the fish had been taken on a glory .
opportunities that had not been allowed would have been explicit .
so i started doing this a few years ago .
eventually , we should be frightening the fear of welcoming .
one accomplishment , is march . how is your brand ?
why is it important to start ? what is the red ?
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free of constraints .
and i was like , &quot; how are you communicating ? &quot;
well , in that night , everyone went to the center to celebrate .
and the key indicator of this is the extinction of languages .
and i had to explain to the journalist that there is no test .
and this is called androgen-receptor .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative thinking , heart beings .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a ph.d. .
at the moment , they &apos;re in the present tense , but we have an incredible opportunity .
and soon , i wrote an article about genetic engineering food .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
so i offered a $ 1,000 price price price software for the winners .
one day , this mirror tells us , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
there was no piano at the time as an instrument .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
even if you were to shoot now , you would have emissions .
most people know the most people out of the software sector .
this is even live on the internet . you can check it out .
it &apos;s our new country , and it &apos;s called nunate favine .
but nothing was invented , i would leave again until now .
and the best part is that they connect to magnets .
some of my cloned passions in the last five years .
i looked into the rag , and it was a little pink .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular tons .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
so the dramatic numbers come down to the prisons .
i gave some talks about the death penalty .
a child in india says , &quot; today i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
this is my long strawberries . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
so the first rule is that combining photographs should have the same perspective .
what correlation is the thought and feelings about you ?
and when they &apos;re threatened , they can really make bad things happen .
and that urgency , that goal , has really changed my life .
they talk about nature &apos;s power to tell us who we are .
if we don &apos;t take a phosphorus inside of the phosphorus .
this piece of 50 year-old technology became the magical thing for me .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours of video per minute are uploaded .
if you could do it for the ones , you could also help me .
and just disappeared all these companies , one after the other .
i &apos;m sad that we never know each other as adults .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserve .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
and therefore , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of individual individualism .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individual alism .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go to the house .
if you could only have one of these , it would be a very different world .
specialized and skills and skills and combination of their combination of success .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
and somehow we need to bring changes to the zero in zero .
we &apos;re still finding other strange things about what their rights are .
this is the current of the most perceptions we have .
this is our youngest tap down there on the right .
back to march , the lhc will be working again .
and this is the message i went to medical school .
do you know how to call a 3,000-plus in league ?
i believe that in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
if someone lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
and so i think the ted community should be his horse .
and it &apos;s spread , of course , organs .
my friends from honduras asked me to say thank ted .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
now , finally , the movie has been a very big one .
in fact , this includes just a period of two weeks .
these people will be connected to the film in forever -- forever .
so all these green areas , these are the targets .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other one is called ss. &quot;
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of god to virtue them .
i went to the car and was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
in the short period of time , i realized one : ted has a identity .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good percentage of intuition to actually do the experiments .
in my opinion , we have changed our world .
this is all reality today , and this is going to be much more possible .
so this allows us to do the kind of thing growing , trust and trust .
here it says , the more you kill , the better .
people said , you don &apos;t have a fear of success ?
i don &apos;t tell you about it , but i can live with it .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely unthinkable .
i love this : &quot; watson opens human enemy . &quot;
i looked at them and smiled , but she looked very seriously .
three months later , i moved and removed the adventure .
it &apos;s about creating needles .
i like a lot of black colors , lots of gray notes and stuff like that .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony &apos;s again .
this is what we want to use as a kind of momentous impulse for the flywheel .
and the question was : how could you connect technology to this new technology ?
for example , i don &apos;t want to give you the same rights as a human being .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and that &apos;s very fast .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s concert .
the man is supposed to have a common ancestor .
and loud signs , f and b , cetera .
how were its living conditions , how the society and politics ?
on september 10 , last year , the machine ran to the first time .
we have litted kids , and we have them play with it .
and when i heard her , she made the end of the day .
and i was good , i was scheduled with claude .
but if i ask you , how are you going to deal with your wife ?
you collect information about the piece in the sekundtrack literature .
now , there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they can all be engaged .
but what if it was the image with all its images ?
you say you never forget the names that you never die .
but she does something that no other government technology does .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
it &apos;s much more challenging than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
we should be able to rotate everything we want .
and i tend to think of myself as a shadow of my shadows .
so , studies have been done to see if this was true .
you see , you know , there &apos;s enormous speed of opportunity there .
the natural mice came out of asia , in the case of japan .
because a good engineer has either built cars or nuclear power plants .
that was the very first beginning of a musical expression .
you can only have zeros when they &apos;re not there .
you &apos;re all fine . the question is , how is it going to make us go ?
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
official rates of all western industrialized industrialized societies .
&quot; do you remember the patient who gave you home ? &quot;
we live on a planet which is 70 percent covered in water .
just swap the building of housing against cities .
namely , they can just go wrong .
often the music lessons is that you learn to read the notes .
that &apos;s what the letters were all about to paint .
eight of them : tsunamid . 9 / cyberattacks : cyber attacks
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
bruno gui : mark mark , mark , come back .
now , even if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , maybe it &apos;s the most necessary game .
so we don &apos;t have to control people , to be poor , to be poor .
now there &apos;s all this rumblee before the big currency .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
they knew all the bits and bygies they had to attack .
it was as italy won the football world cup .
in our observations , we have all sorts of unconvenient areas .
and she was much worse than for b in the memory .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who suffered more of both likes ? &quot;
we &apos;re not only telling stories when we &apos;re telling ourselves to tell stories .
a deception becomes a little bit progression because someone perceives it like this .
why ? because we don &apos;t have paralysis , and you know what ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
if i &apos;m not right , the canvas is not a man .
you &apos;re basically learning to read that first thing before you only speak one word .
to keep practice pray directly , directly with the composers .
right now , we can get these kinds of nutrients back into agriculture .
but the tool of information storage has been around since years-long .
and then the headlines under the headlines and the citizen and science .
listen to it , and tell you whether it tastes or not .
he ended up doing something completely new .
what you need is an environment that you put in that situation .
if you go back and do not make the mistake again .
these are new nanotechnes on the way , nano-materials .
my grandmother was at the end of the room and stared at me .
you agreed to swallow it up when it fails .
before i close the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
big data are transformed for organizations around the world in big opportunities .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
at the same time , it &apos;s a real-time scan and a motion picture .
under a hat , i &apos;m involved with the history of anatomy .
well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
she &apos;s the last defense before something happens into the body .
and as i say the word justice , this is the unpleasant feeling .
why am i saving my audience now that it &apos;s also active ?
when your work flew -- not your fault , right ?
we know something about the happiness of happiness itself .

here &apos;s a very fundamental service . is there light at home , so you can read the homework ?
the greeks called these divine spirits of creativity of creativity .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch them go to the next century .
and we put an evolutionary process in the machine , which is going on in the micro-second sphere .
so in other words , each year &apos;s future has shrunk a year since i was on this world .
they &apos;re shooting the decision -- they &apos;re shooting themselves if it &apos;s their own best interest .
so these things -- you know , people remember -- this is kind of why we &apos;re interested in .

the driver of mood objects are not only humans , but also the light that seems to them , and the wind will give them over to you and the heat of space .
but tomorrow , it can be for us to think about the challenges -- think about climate change or the co2 emissions -- as we can shift from the digital physical world to the physical .

i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology and i &apos;ve been studying for a few years now with the biohacking , and i &apos;ve started this because i just wanted to know and i wanted to do it all the time i was studying in the theoretical theoretically .
and i left the medical school with the impression that i knew if i knew everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close as possible as i could , that i would be resistant to inertia .
and then , if i go to another step in these interspecies interfaces , where i use voice per person , language , crashes , and i don &apos;t have to control and cursor the cursor , then i &apos;m even faster and even more immediate .
that means i &apos;ve actually crippled them now , that they don &apos;t see any pattern in the middle , but i &apos;ve been searching for them to go back and see this dog in this picture .
in that moment , where i would turn my hand from you , so you can see from the back , this fingers , my finger , just where it was , where it was in a position , so stretched .

when we get to these really big stages -- with over 100,000 base pairs -- they &apos;re not just going to grow into ecoli . it &apos;s going to grow all the modern molecular biology , and so we turn ourselves into other mechanisms .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an outsider , a new anxiety , in the image -- not just okay , but what you have to be grateful , maybe a gift of the box .
and so i &apos;m looking at a whole other view of the city , a very different impression , which i see negative and positive zones and such a city , and this kind of way , is a very virtual map of a city , very real city .

and that &apos;s very amazing , because you really believe that this high-tech technology that you see is actually bringing the future into the future , but in fact it &apos;s the future that the future is right at us with our archaic roots .
and because i was born without waking legs , and my feet were given after you , and i only had a couple of toes and a few other toes at the feet of the brush , that strangers had to bring about the bad news .

when we &apos;re in a game world , i think many of us turn into our best version , and right now we &apos;re ready to try to solve the hard problem , which is how long it should be .
and i &apos;m just looking at one of these little devices , because the things should always be more intuitive , natural , friendly user , and you have to look at what is , of course , what used to be friendly or intuitive .
you have no fear that you have to live your life for a long time , and you never come out of it , and you &apos;re going to die on a rotated swarm dreams -- your mouth filled with the bites of asks ?

and i &apos;d like to conclude with this phrase , and i &apos;d like to end again , and again , to think about designers , to come up with new solutions , and in this sense , thank you very much for your attention and attention .
and i definitely know that it would be for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start this dark encounters , this sort of path down to the path -- especially in the exact process that i &apos;ve just come to find myself in my career .
the older man stood up . he saw the puty puty , and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come to this young man to say , don &apos;t lose the goal . don &apos;t give the eyes . &quot;

and when , of course , something intuitively intuitively is intuitive , and as i can take their impact on it and make things like this , that they use friendly , so they &apos;re intuitive , so intuitively , because they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re just too easy to use .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t make them -- those who scare those who scare the shores and who without the constraints , who with good outcomes and good results .
the big problems also have big problems . the cost , especially in highly regulations are high countries . the question is that you really don &apos;t feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the fact that the human work is not used for the fuel .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid of being a real infection , and it keeps millions of people from flourishing .
now , to decide not to buy a glass beetles is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our daycare -- but it turns out that decides that surveillance also affects us very consequence of consensus .
i don &apos;t have to call these things emotionally , because the corner is always going to be a crazy , vibrant , vibrant , etc . , just wait for me , when i love a little bit in the heart , and i have some search .

i met these guys from grave , graffiti research , and they have a technology that allows them to inject a light on any given surface , and then draw a laser pointer that does just the surface .
so , what that means is that if we look back at what happens in evolution , and how we think about the place in people &apos;s evolution , and how we look at the next stage , i would say that there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
so there are great prices here . there are challenges in transmission . for example , if we say that the energy of the country is out there , you don &apos;t just need to take the technology , you also have to deal with the risk of where the energy comes from .
but , as we think , the only type of biology will have a huge impact on the cost of food , or the limitation of its availability of availability , when we see co2 as a outcome , and therefore we work on these cells that are going to go away .
i started working with this , scientific literature , which is how these centrifuge are built in natural gas , and it found that they are structured in structure , and each kains contain four centuries of centrifuge .

what i do instead , and what the designers do as well , is we think of an abstract state-of-the-art machine , and this machine makes it a little bit better , and we could make it bigger than we could ever do .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workings around the world , with students , and architects , even with the make-fortune companies , and there &apos;s something about this task , which is depths deep in nature , and i want to share some of it with you .

i studied historians , and in this case , i studied how people went to anatomy -- human body , animal bodies -- how they went to with fluid body concepts ; how they thought about bodies .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the minister of health , who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to take the backs of my experts in mammography , or some credit salad patients with his patients .

she wasn &apos;t fast , she was not fast enough . she ran and ran and ranged , but she didn &apos;t reach the house and she walked through the rolled through the wheelchair , and she passes it . she said , she was going to move over the land , and she said , &quot; well , you know , you &apos;re going to a other poet . &quot;
now , this one may be a moderate contribution , and if it was better than me , it would be great , but my core statement here is that we have to work at all five , and we can &apos;t give them any of them because they agreed us , because they all have significant problems .
and where you can see how far we &apos;ve gone from that , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , that we can all be on earth , you can see , for example , that bach has a program , up to 40 , 20 , 20 , what you want to be here , per maneuclil . right ?
in my 20s about 20 years of health sentiment and journalism , i &apos;ve built a personal medical study on medical treatment , and i &apos;ve created everything for my first article that i &apos;ve done for the toronto of my toronto , &quot; black coat , &quot; art , to learn .
so , with the total transparency of transparency , which is what new think is thinking about , which is , you know , not saying that in the agent of the horse , and no longer a beef or some other phenomena , which i want to just tick out the bloodbath and the knee to do .
now , not exactly what i was hoping for , but i was walking up -- the stakeholds up , the flood , along the &quot; real firemen , &quot; the firemen who were finished at that point were pretty much done in the room to bring a pair of shoes into a pair of shoes .
i had to do a lot of seems to be repeated at with these slides -- in different colors -- you know , to build my leg muscles , and i hated them more than anything else . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
but we wanted to go a lot further . we wanted to build an entire bacterial chromosome , and it had more than 50,000 letters , so we thought , we could build it in the scale of the virus that we could understand the size of the variation to understand what the individual components are in a cell .
and i want to talk to you this morning , a innovator of the innovator , i want to share with you a little bit of -- he gave me the permission -- his technical , &quot; the slingness , &quot; and that many of you may have heard about . it &apos;s the size of a refrigerator .
&quot; clouds , &quot; something that my friends in autodesk call &quot; seniors , &quot; and sensors , robots , 3d prints , enabling our personal planet to synthesize , synthetic biology , infants , vaccine and digital medicine , digital medicine and artificial intelligence .
if you look at this amazing demonstrations : voodoo acodoc in a transcendent state , the adding coal , not burning , an amazing demonstration of the mind of the mind of the mind so that it can affect that if it &apos;s in the extreme state of the recovery .
this was the surreal world form of d√©vu ju , which i &apos;ve ever experienced before , because before i had a corner of a bow , i always knew what was going on in the red light of the throwing , i was going to go over there , i was going to be a movie set of film as a movie .
and in this picture , i &apos;ve taken a bus shelf as a branch of desperation in all directions , because if you look at the changing tree of life , all of the existing specialties that have existed in this branch of evolutionary success , you have survived : it has survived ; it has its environment and its strength .
and then with this premise with this premise with this premise , brian dementia tries in england , who tried to commit a minimum , then they took such a printed cosmic , a cooper , a heat , and so peeling , and so on and then they started to grow , and then bacteria working together .
and then just came from the do-it-yourself advisor , the founder of the green website , and he said o.o. we must meet , we really have to meet , real , and then have two organized pieces of london , a thousand in london , second , and a thousand in the u.s. economy , in san francisco , in san francisco .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . they have this thing on the left -- the co2 that they want to bring to zero , and the number of people who are dependent on the services , each person in the average of the average power , the average energy for each person , and the co2 emitter of the energy per unit .
and the realization of president lobo was that , in a sense , i thought about the sensus that i thought about as a way of bringing the rural investors to come and build this city , that could be equivalent to every partisas for all of honduras in honduras , which has been suffering for many years .
i read this list of a friend that read and had to make it laugh , which was so ridiculous , but i just came to the court , &quot; and i couldn &apos;t stop talking , and i had to read , and i had to go out and collect them , and collect them after that flooding and blow the emotional limb .
a group of ankara , who i &apos;ve learned a while ago , who &apos;s a student who wants to convey a group of people who wanted to convey more to convey what she wanted to learn in college and have so little feathers on small actions , and explain to people what this n.a is .
there are 175 resses in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the extra 10 different extra production line and 12 ballet that you could buy a large number of descendants in sale in your own desks , where you don &apos;t have a number of charity in the 17th grade store for you .
and it was really , and it was really , really , really , really , really , really , and you go into the &apos; phase in the &apos; phase , which is a picture that &apos;s going to happen , where i &apos;ve asked myself 10 years after mark , the mark was still there , yes , logic , loaf , in the collective safer , of course , to be that great to be .
now , what i &apos;m going to show you first is how fast i &apos;m going to show you , is the basic work , a new technology that we can overcome as part of an exception just a year , and the ragadon is ragadon , and it &apos;s a environment that is either in either locally large or huge amounts of data that we can deal with .
the first thing that happens when you become a kid , as a baby , is that you take care of what &apos;s going on , what are you making ? and after your parents have allowed you to play more or less lethal child , and to honor , more , more , more of course , more curiosity will be in the earth .
i mean , most of our eyebrows of our life -- and i &apos;ve chosen this -- you know , the psychological presence as a presence for about three seconds , which means you know that there are about 600 million of them in about 600 million of them , and there &apos;s about a month in a month , and most of them don &apos;t leave behind them .
bill gates : to run the simulation on a supercomputer , all of the great scientists have done , what we need is just a few million people , and if we have our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s safe , that it &apos;s reasonable , only in the 100 million people .
it really works , that &apos;s going to be done in academic , and we thought , well , o.k. , that maybe we &apos;ve got a webcam , put it up , flip the noise , flip the lens , turn it off , then you &apos;ve got a microscope , you &apos;ve got a microscope , which is about a hundred times bigger .
if i show you 600 magazines , and you &apos;ll be on 10 categories , or i &apos;ll show you 400 magazines , and in these 20 categories , and then you &apos;ll think that i &apos;ll give you more choices , and i &apos;ve given you a better choice , than i &apos;ve given you 400 of them , if i gave you 600 people 600 .
it &apos;s friday &apos;s friday , friday bita . seed friday friday &apos;s work . peace talks about the knee , knee friday , friday friday friday friday &apos;s friday morning . don &apos;t you think you &apos;re going to be driving this conversation without even talking about this video , i hope .
i believe that a significant canary -- not the only one , but one significant contribution to this depression of depression , and morality is that people have disappointed because their standards are so high , and if they have to explain , they have to themselves , they think they &apos;re blame .
nevertheless , the neolithic revolution that brought us agriculture , and in this moment , the secular season , created the bars of the poetry by the proposal of the psa and the archie and the hierarchy of hierarchy , and overshoots -- just 10,000 years ago , instead , happened .
so if you focus on a laser , you focus on a space , then you can catch little particles in the space , or you can catch them in the air , and then you can move them into the liquid , and then in that focus , so the one can catch like a torture , like a torture , like a torture , right ?
well , it would be great if we could put this paradigm of normal thinking against other possibilities or the strength of the strength , even a little bit more dangerous , to be able to communicate , and so we could release the forces of very few kids , and invite them to bring their special skills into the society .
you know , as michelangelo moses , does it mean that he took the end of the hammer and created it -- in fact , you can still see a little bit of drunk , and said , &quot; oh , pernon parchi , why don &apos;t you spell ? &quot;
but if you &apos;re sitting in 2011 today in 2011 , if you &apos;re buying a new color printer of the leaders of the leading printing press and print a page , then you &apos;ve got these bright blows on every page print , in a clear pattern that &apos;s clearly projected on your back and forth .
if you look at my colleague at asbee , you could see that much more about the true and the many other wonderful things you can do with , but i &apos;d like to talk about the second part that we &apos;re talking about , and that &apos;s the start of our environment .
now , the problem -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have the sympathy for the harnesses of the inheritance , when they look at obesity and colorful , but they sort of look at the past while the real world is causing our world .
and then i tried this in my lab , and i tried to spend a little bit of time , and then i went out and bought myself on a hand-ebay and bought a little bit of d.c. analysis , which is trying to get a hand-brainer , so -- so , in fact , this is how a d.c is going to be able to be able to do it again .
if you were to choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your own self and you must think about how you decide to do this conflict , because if you think about it in the time you get an answer , and if you could think about it in the sense , if you could get a different sense of memory , you could get some answer .
in the early &apos; 80s , i got a really amazing job when my professor asked if i was to go to haiti , and go to the secret societies that was filmed by the whistling of the doings of duty and macouton , and that was using to make it safe , to make it safe .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people are always asking me to tell me how to deal with widows , and i &apos;m going to tell you something that has never fed me for me , and i always feel very uncomfortable with asking people to answer questions , and i think i understand why .
and when i &apos;m wearing this now , for example , in which i &apos;m a congestion charge , selective , selective choice , where all of this is to come up to me , i &apos;m in the details , and i &apos;m saying , &quot; yeah , you can throw it anywhere , &quot; or i can throw it down , and i can buy it anywhere , and so on .
i recommend all of you to read steves , or look at the movie , so that you can &apos;t only understand the magnificent , between these men who have emerged , but also how the music connected music , and how it was the instrument that allowed the game to be able to get the thylacine of the woold-out of the street .
so here in the bottom picture , you see the laboratory , in anecdotal screw , so there &apos;s a garage with all kinds of lab rubber , the rubber , has a group of paris in paris , which is pretty successful , and it &apos;s pretty interesting , and it &apos;s very interesting , because i &apos;m going to do just a little bit of a project .
not a biologist would argue , for example , that 50 percent or more of all species are dying out there , because it &apos;s not true , and yet , this apocalyptium -- the most apocalyptium on the field of biological diversity -- which is hardly known as the most optimistic scenario of all of the species .
bg : well , we haven &apos;t yet set up a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting legal rules for everything that &apos;s going on in the name of a nuclear interest , and there are people in the business of the corporate rush in russia , china , and i &apos;ve met in india here , and i &apos;ve spoken about how this would fit energy to the power .
the computer visions have taken these images together so that they held the real room in which all of these images were made near grassi storm into the canadian canadian rockets , and you see elements of stabilidietas or oramoras , and these things have been converted to all the spatial and all of these things .
and then , if you look at the software that we &apos;ve just seen before , then you will understand why nine-to-nine percent of our software or not intuitive , or not user , which is the ipad in a lot of talk , even though it &apos;s pretty much more intuitive than software .
the result is that result -- we call it &quot; patient &quot; -- it sounds like a good thing , but in fact , a reality is the burden of making decisions for somebody from their name -- something of the name of the doctor -- who knows nothing to somebody -- and probably isn &apos;t sick and therefore in the best constitution -- to make a decision about the patient &apos;s decision .
and that idea was when i was in the process of writing on the process of writing , economy , i fell in love with this grueling step in the second that we all fall when we &apos;re working on something , and you don &apos;t think you &apos;re going to think it &apos;s going to be a little bit worse . it &apos;s going to be the worst that the book was ever written .
we also have one of these same aggregated waters in the same size , as he &apos;s standing in the hall , in fact , around the full dynamics of this net , in which now it looks like this , this is from the back of the back here , the big battery there , that &apos;s the big battery here , that we &apos;re carrying all around with , the web .
they believed that a genius of this kind of magical creature was shaped by the means that it literally lives in the walls of an artist &apos;s office -- like the dodo , the household , the artist , the artist and the artist , in a certain age , would make it work , and the work would make it happen .
if i want to make you think about one thing today , it &apos;s that the amount of data that we consume is greater than the sum of its parts , and instead of thinking of overlapping information on information , i want you to think about how we can use information about the pattern , and so that we can recognize the trends , and we wouldn &apos;t be able to see the otherwise .
so we &apos;ve done this in a study that i &apos;ve done with shlomo and alessandro , who we &apos;ve done a study of people who &apos;ve done work with -- all those who &apos;ve been working for -- and these people were all in a part of the collection of the collection they &apos;ve done for their rentrens .
interesting historic footnote : when the moses of southern spain brought them up with these corals . the language changed over centuries , over centuries of allah , allah , lah , laolololnate , olnaolnaol√© , you still fight on deadlines and deadly behalf .
now , today , you need , if you want to win a race , actually something like this -- something that &apos;s driving in real time , some thousands of sensors that have found information from the car that you &apos;re going to pass on , and then you &apos;re going to use that car and then you &apos;re going to take these decisions back to the car , and you &apos;re going to change things in real time .
i was frightened of fear , but i was frightened that i could lose it , that he could fall into one of his conditions , and that i could destroy him the relationship of the mind if i started to talk about instructions and suspect and suspect and exciting other forms of egotissues .
so , in fact , the fact is that you remember the 20th century , in 300 years , not for your wars or technological innovation , but much more than a era of a era that we were in and against the massive destruction , and the biodiversity of the earth &apos;s biodiversity are either active on earth or either around the world , so it &apos;s not the change .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which was supposed to be the measurement of things in visual effects and computer-generated effects in a very new , realistic , realistic human character , expressive characters that had been made . and the main ks had to be the main one , and should all be the cg in the world .
i probably hear these two nice girls who are still there , i think , probably the generation of the generation that has donated bad for this country , because i &apos;ve been studying 100,000-old-class engaging instructions that i &apos;ve already been studying in cardboard school today , which is a high-tech machine , which is called kit .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had an eye-opening session after my lecture , who was a story of &#91; unclear &#93; , who said he &apos;d heard a sink , and it was absolutely completely real music , and at the end of the room , and there was a constituent sound of the circle of the circle .
you know ? i think you know ? i think a mere person to allow him to think that he thinks that he or she was like the vessel , and the essence and the source of all of the divine , creative , unknown , mysterious , is a little bit too small , to give them a lot of responsibility to perform human insurance .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economically economic , and at the same time the co2 says , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not a co2 emitter , i wish it &apos;s not a co2 emitted , that it &apos;s almost impossible to accept it , but i &apos;ll probably accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the cost . &quot;
it &apos;s actually this kind of true thing , because if you have a patient who has two layers of reflection in two different kinds of surveys , and which is to choose , then the passenger pigeon , who has the memory that has less , and that is the bad one that &apos;s chosen , that &apos;s going to be selected .
you know all the healthy chairman , if you give a secret of the best prize , even though this is going to disappear , and then you get the best friend , and the best friend gets confronted with it , and the best friend gets a horrific , but if you get a bad at the end , and you make sure you never make a mistake again .
you know , you know , one of the great haves in travel , and one of the pleasures of ethnic ethnic research is to connect with people who still remember the old days , still remember the old days . still feel the way they &apos;re in the wind , they &apos;re touched by a rain , in the bitter , they &apos;re feeding the crop into the plants .
if you ever have the chance to have a chance to work in your urban durban center , like our scott box as part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re all going to do that -- you &apos;re all seeing that you &apos;re going to see the people who are calling different issues , including problems , including a poem in your house .
so the nice thing about this is , when you do this , you know , agriculture , biogas , built on a hectare of a five-day habit in favelas , so it can be about a thousand-fifth and a half thousand dollars , and you have the chickers , and you have a chickens and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables .
we &apos;re at the amazing wave of amazing events , amazing events in many areas . and i really think that we &apos;re going to have to go back 300 years ago to the enlightenment of the enlightenment to find a time in which we have progress in the progress that we have these things over heated , and more than now .
so , by looking at color , being able to change color , contrast and golity to the rings of the individual images , photographers , behaving , such as depths , depths of depths and disturbing colors , and disorders that we have between the lines and the images and the lest photograph , even though it can reveal a single image of hundreds of just hundreds of these elevators .
if i was in a room full of colleagues and ask their immediate support , and i would tell you about what i was telling you , i probably wouldn &apos;t have the story of the second story before they really have an unpleasant , somebody would give you a joke , and they would forget about the rest of them , and they would forget the rest .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good thing to take your hearing , take your personal communications device -- i &apos;ll give you permission , and maybe you can look back on a box of cathedral , because that &apos;s why you &apos;re not going to make any sense of this speech .
a few years ago , the laser prize in the shinyaman academy has taken to his research in the adults of adults , has taken a blade , and just through the manipulation of four genes , just to lead a cell to a stem cell to a stem cell -- a potentially a cell in which he &apos;s able to become a beer cell in a body .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve set all the kinds of batteries that are made , looked at the cars , for computers , cell phones , lamps , lamps , everything , and i &apos;ve got a lot of the energy that uses electronic energy , which is what i &apos;ve found in the world . i &apos;ve found that all the batteries that we can produce less than 10 minutes of lake .
now , let &apos;s take a step back into the big bang , 14 years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signature of animals , perhaps three to four years ago on earth -- the first twin organisms that might have been so much more than a billion years ago -- and then the human species that live in the last 130,000 years ago .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral emergency room that ended up in the computer with flickr of flickr , and they just flickr flickr in flickr , and they &apos;re going to get rid of men and shirt at the university and so on , and so on , each of these orange feminine reviews , which represents a model of this model as a model .
and yet , in this country , in this country , in the ancient state of the old man , we &apos;re doing -- this is the risk for death , for the sake , for example , if the sacrifice is more than if it &apos;s black , it &apos;s 22 times higher , and if the black is white -- the same to the earth , the people in their bodies are judged into the body .
i was traveling with a young colleague of 6,000 miles from western china in china through southeast coma , and only after i hated la , i saw the face behind the face of the statistics , and 60,000 monuments turned into the snow , and the 1.2 million people were turned around the revolution of the cultural revolution .
and that &apos;s why the idea is , now , when you have all kinds of problems to invest in something where you first came from -- and the investment is that the investment isn &apos;t so clear . in fact , ipcc is not the worst thing to do , and there are people in the rich world who look at the cpc , and they say that &apos;s not a big drama .
we cleaned the chromosome of the chromosome of a microbes . it was crude , these two may be far apart as people and mice , and we gave some extra genes out of that chromosome so that we could select the chromosome . we could destroy it all of the enzymes , and it was quite astonishing -- and we put it in a very surprising cell -- and we put it very , very sophisticated here .
margaret mead , the great anthropologist said , before she died , she &apos;s frightened that as we go to a favor , in the midst century , not only do we move the entire bandwidth of the entire human imagination in a way , but we would see that we had a dream coming out of a dream , and we have forgotten opportunities for another .
i would like to show you an original image of noah noah , and that &apos;s from a single prototype of photosynth of the summer that we &apos;ve been working on in summer to show you what i think is really the pointing technology behind this photosynthetic device , and that is not necessarily the way that you &apos;re looking at the interfaces that we have on the site .
in some studies of other words , in some ways , have shown a measurable impact , the placebo effect , which is why , because the person thinks they &apos;re with it , whether it &apos;s a pharmaceutical or a kind of pain , a pain , a patient , if there are only enough patients , there are only enough measurements in the body , they have an impact on the placebo .
when one said said no , it was the macup cattle that broke down a completely crummy , and i &apos;ve had 10 years of biking doubt about whether i &apos;m actually studying my great engineering for maybe a waway of waving waving , because all of my colleagues have always dive out of my son of my son , you missed the money for a window of your child .
i had recently encountered such a meeting when i met the extraordinary american slide in th slide , which is now over 90 , but the whole life was in thick , and she told me that when she was growing up in the villainia exchange outside the field , she said , and she could hear how a poem across the landscape she was .
it means that a little kid who grows up to believe that the mountain is growing up , that the mountain is a puppet , or your destiny , your destiny will determine , and other people will have a relationship to this place , or this place , as a little kid growing up of montana , that grows into the mountain , that a pile is going to be able to carry off .
it &apos;s usually my role in explaining to people how wonderful new technologies that are coming to the technologies that are coming , and i thought to myself , i &apos;m here , under my friends , i would tell you what i &apos;m really trying to do , and also try to understand what &apos;s going on in front of you , and what &apos;s going on with these incredible lethal technologies , which ones that we can &apos;t happen .
and that would be the answer to their answer to bjn born borges that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals that suffer from poverty , the poverty reduction of malaria and so that it &apos;s a dumb waste of money , if there &apos;s money , there &apos;s a lot of money to invest on things , while we can do better .
now , these people have come online to wealth , but they &apos;ve made it illegal by using trolls to make money from our bank accounts , while we &apos;ve done our online database , or our keyboard , our keyboard , or our credit card information that has collection on the output information that we &apos;ve collected online for a while we buy a computer online .
again , women parks used to go back to montgoma , where they test two of their elderly friends , these elderly women , johnson , who had never organized the monthyerie boomycotted -- an incredible american virginia -- and virginia , a , whose husband made , a fiereley . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and they &apos;ve got two bathes and said , &quot; well , we have done this , and we &apos;re doing this , and then we &apos;ve got cheap , and then we &apos;ve got open source , open hardware , stuff like this electronics , and these are actually built , and these are now the market markers , and they &apos;re actually the cheapest capsuits in the world . &quot;
it made me think of other people as my friends under the khal , who believe that this is the forests of the cake of humortgage and the boardroom and the canoe candidates and the canopy of the gnerd , the northwest of the world , the sanitation of their sanitation .
so just a week ago , a week ago , eh of the national academy of drama for francis of francis and wilderness , two scientists who developed independent techniques to encourage the natural process to encourage to work and to lead a protein level in an efficient class in medicine -- which is called the &quot; naked evolution . &quot; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ;
now , as well as in biology , i want to take this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , that biology comes from biology , that actually biology is an information science , because this is a code code that is abstract code , it &apos;s not as abstract as a computer , because it &apos;s dynamic because it &apos;s dynamic because matter , so it &apos;s real matter , and it &apos;s not real matter .
so , bruce brown , a well-known design researcher at the british university is so far as to say that this media , he meant the mass media , and the picture , which is not the internet , and so on , the internet and so on and so on and on , what we call mass media , today , is that these mass media memories have captured and captured our virtual memories .
in fact , some really happy people , some of the happities and companies , profitable companies and profitable profits , they agreed , because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will let it go back to the mess -- the name of the talk that they buy , you know , the title of the time , who didn &apos;t have a lot of content on what the subject was going to be like .
now , this phrase , from the entrance of action , is that success or success , or whether it &apos;s a challenge to not be predetermined by the imperative of unprecedented experience , but as if my life was so successful , because i could fall assign the prosist of a prosthetic arm with a prosthetic arm , or how people could perceive me with my disability .
and when these people came and looked at these people , and who was the best proteins in the world , who was not a professor , who was not a professor of caltech , who was a man from england , a chester , a woman who worked as a assic assic assistant in business assistant to a clinic , and who was the best proteins in the world at night .
of course , it was just a simple trick of dr. p.p. so i didn &apos;t want to do it , i didn &apos;t want to make it , with the view that 15 year-old girls in the hospital are going to be in the second , but he actually brought me to do it , in fact , compared to the daily reference with my new conception , and that &apos;s how a new experience became a new experience .
in the past year i &apos;ve been looking for modeling models to do this , i &apos;ve been trying to do this in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies , to see whether they might be in a better or better common way , as we &apos;ve had some creative ideas about how to deal with the creative risks of creativity , to deal with creativity .
so we have a situation where , as we have a situation where , as our science continues , we have to get more to the conclusion that these categories that we have thought for iconic categories that have very , very simple convictions to create convictions in terms of idential power , to create a lot more sophisticated , than we have taken out .
so i went home , and i went home to dinner with my wife , and i told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , if there &apos;s this technology , if you can use your eyes to find things , then we should find a way to find a way to guide , that he can make a laser again , so that he could do the genius . &quot;
and so there &apos;s a lot of different things about it , but the nice thing about this is that an uranian molecule has so much energy about how we say , a coal molecule , and therefore if you can deal with the problems and maintain , and that are mostly the footprint , the footprint , the cost of going on , so the impact on the other things , and almost the other things that are good .
from the medical standpoint of view , of course , you can say that my legs , the laser surgery , the disabled surgery , the joints of artificial life and artificial hips , which allow for the people to really use all of their opportunities , and to evolve beyond the border , their natural destiny has not to speak , to speak , to be able to give to people a sense of the world , and to organize itself in a sense , and to focus on each other .

i &apos;m going to conclude my words in a english scientist . hummingbird , daddy , who i suspect as he uses the experiments of arrested defense arrested , his student was michael faraday , who said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the human mind as the fact that our scientific beliefs are noises , that there are no mysterious in nature , and that our new worlds are not tough , and there are no new worlds of the world . &quot;
and we &apos;re going to travel a series of tracks in the ethnic sphere that we &apos;re taking into our audience from such places such that they are blessed by the legislatures , and hopefully , they become one by another one of the other revelations of the anthropology : that this world has contributed to different ways that we can actually find a way to a multicultural opportunity in the world of life , and hope that we can broadency .
you know , one of them is through the great choice of salesman , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and it &apos;s perfect -- which is salatstine ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that others would have been better . and what this alternative is an alternative response to them , and that is that they would be able to make them feel that they were able to do that , and that they would have perfect thing that they &apos;d have had a good choice on their own .
and at the end of this amazing initiation , you will suddenly take a moment out , and for the first time in your life , in the age of 18 years , you will see a sunset . and in this crystal moment of consciousness , when the sun begins to go to the hardest part of the sun , suddenly , suddenly , what they have learned in the abstract environment , and then , like that , &quot; did you look , and i have it ? &quot;
in fact , i found out that there were time-makers in all of my childhood , whether i had no matter whether i &apos;d won a contest competition in the second grade , whether i &apos;d been with the finance in the parties &apos; party , whether i was on parent , whether i was my pending or my pending sports , or my sports newsman , and he had these students to use his students to take the nephazers in the medical school .
you know , if you have people who are persuasive believe that they have a soul or you can say that they have a soul , or you can tell that they have been deployed from the soul to life , that &apos;s what it would be like , rather than the spirit of a soul , they don &apos;t combine them , and they &apos;re sort of crashing away from the blood , and they &apos;re sort of crashing it to injustice , it out the earth &apos;s unclear , it &apos;s life .
i was inspired as a computer scientist -- inspired by the way of our interactions with objects -- with my specialty pates and my colleagues , evaluated me , i started to wonder : what if we could use computers , instead of a digital fingertip of a fingertip of a fingertip , what would it be like if we could do with both -- and physically , if we could attack it with some physical data , physically , physically and we could attack it ?
so i would like to summarize that my talk , and that is what i would like to do , for the last time , to summarize that the characteristics and the skills that we made out of , and the age of voice-age , and that &apos;s a little bit of blended up in the age of machine , that the help of cylinder , that we can actually turn back to these kinds of new kinds of technologies , but in our future , actually go back to come back and come back to the future .
so , in the age of three , age three is separated from age three , and separated families from their families , and in a hazis from the world of stone , they went to age 18 , and they chose the glacier for 18 years , two dreams of nine years , when the nine years were elected to pregnant , the pregnancy of the pregnancy they were shooting at their mother .
if we were to go to this place four in vitao , say , &quot; what happens if we could do an undelusion of our land -- if we just take a message from an american message , one part of the american empire , and the people who want to work under the messages where they can work under the united states or the united states and the united states where they can work , they can go , and usually do everything else in the world , right ? &quot;
i &apos;d like to end with a poem by a poem called haz , which is a poem by a charitable poem in 14th century , and i was told by my friend jacbois . and this is called , &quot; the poem of god , &quot; only four words , &quot; god , &quot; god doesn &apos;t know the god , the god forbite , but the word god is constantly telling me the words that he &apos;s always going to go back and say , &quot; this guy , and he just always tells me how to come .
now , if someone has swallowed and divided all of these mosquitos , and made all these sacrifices , and who they are , all of them will be my photo of the emergency room with all of these data on it , and i can use it as a whole point of view , to use this space to use these other people , and that are using these kinds of social interchannels , and then other people who are involved in the grassroots that are interactive with other than the use of the grassroots .
so again , we &apos;ve got a huge aviation story , but because of course , we &apos;ve got the problem of a business and then we &apos;ve got six thousand , and we &apos;ve decided that we &apos;re going to go back and back and forth again , and we &apos;re going to go back and we &apos;re going to go back and go back to the future of my future , and that &apos;s the crazy thing we &apos;re going to get over again , and we &apos;re going to get back to say that it &apos;s going to errors , again , that people who are going to be going to be thinking about things .
however , there &apos;s not a lot of malaria in the places where it &apos;s going to take a lot of malaria to put in the deep ocean , or the kasan of tibet , but they still have a long time , and yet , through the long term of the earth , the globe , the idea is not to be driven , but to be close to the idea that the earth is going to exist , because the earth is going to exist , in a way that it &apos;s going to be tilend .
to make it easier for people to do it more often , to make it so that the system so that they can make cuban , which is to make it easier for them to make the errors , the error of people who make it more likely to be able to support for them to be able to be able to do worse , and in fact , to actually understand the health care , and to speak up for them , and to reason for people who understand how to reward and to reward them .
