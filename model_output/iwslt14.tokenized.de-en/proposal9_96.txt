from seattle ...
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re singing .
but it goes .
it doesn &apos;t happen .
yeah , hello .
we love innovation .
solar technology is ...
that &apos;s not ...
we were poor .
are they all ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
after a week .
great trick ?
we were .
some less .
and he says ...
we know that .
ta-da !
twice .
here it is .
this is going fast .
they need time .
music as a language .
that &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... not yet .
thank you .
what a fish .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
that &apos;s efficient .
wonderful , right ?
totally inefficient .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much .
they &apos;re advising .
the only opportunity .
no hospital .
thank you .
stephen watts .
three out of 10 .
that was incredible .
thank you . thank you .
yes , in a way .
it &apos;s terrible .
long , yes .
fantastic , right ?
the sun goes to the sun .
oh my god .
we love entertainment .
we &apos;re going to lift .
so where are they going ?
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we lose them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
a whole lot .
sounds good ?
the whole environmental debate .
sounds familiar , what ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
that &apos;s great .
that was fascinating .
could i be honest ?
the farm is incredible .
what did they do ?
robert gupta .
this is the system .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
yeah , good day .
lento , slowly .
that &apos;s all interested in me .
we can do that .
so what do you say ?
not very sustainable .
yes , milliseconds .
that &apos;s our present .
they have similar principles .
yeah , good day .
good job ! yes !
just do your job .
this was the result .
thank you very much .
and she did .
so they meet al .
it &apos;s essential .
they &apos;re all important .
very different things .
unprecedented .
this is actually me .
it &apos;s electronics .
yeah , that &apos;s going on .
flying cat .
this is the last .
can we change it ?
these days are over .
these people make money .
what happened here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
again , they refused .
and that &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know .
centers were built .
what happened here ?
but do you know what ?
what was the result ?
i was amazed .
it &apos;s generic .
so they knew everything .
you could see manhattan .
here &apos;s the video .
it has sensors .
why not live longer ?
he opens the door .
a couple more .
that &apos;s very good .
oh , so the one .
there &apos;s no normal .
yeah , i know .
pretty good , not ?
but do you know what ?
i have a question .
okay . thank you .
i stood up to him .
don &apos;t sit around .
so they can do that .
they &apos;re bad . &quot;
so let &apos;s see .
it doesn &apos;t work .
what do these people need ?
i don &apos;t think that .
i thought about it .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
they use their hands .
so how does this work ?
as you &apos;re interested .
that would have been okay .
what are media today ?
you can go in .
so where do we go ?
so it &apos;s true .
how do we know ?
because you know what ?
it &apos;s not a country .
why do we do that ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
bg : thank you .
this is a wish .
and i was artists .
let &apos;s call him don &apos;t .
not school management .
and it has to go back .
we can do it differently .
they even do hurts .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
an unleashing challenge .
there &apos;s no food .
it &apos;s against justice .
but the wrong things .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
i &apos;m a writer .
here &apos;s another example .
i meet kids .
it feels great .
i swear it .
i wonder .
he &apos;s not going to do that .
thank you for listening .
why should we do that ?
thank you .
here &apos;s an example .
you see it immediately .
not poisonous in there .
but i kept working on .
or before bombs .
i &apos;ll go in here .
there are two options .
we need energy miracle .
why does this happen at all ?
oh . a moment .
let me tell you .
what do you want to do ?
that &apos;s what happens to us today .
and i kept working on .
so she was back .
and so it was .
yes , here it is .
i &apos;m going to tell you very much .
and why is that ?
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what would everything have to be done ?
i mean the soul .
you &apos;re comparing the same .
in china , it was different .
fortunately not , yes ?
that &apos;s not protection .
teach pee a chance .
does anyone see any particular ?
and i always had it .
very expensive mobilies .
people were playing crazy .
what creates the illusion ?
my gut feeling again .
after just a journey there .
first , limited .
i created one .
yeah . well , good .
imagine the camera .
jk : both of them .
but it gets worse .
this is where you see it .
thank you very much .
be a mentor .
maybe 10 times a lot .
but it didn &apos;t .
the data came in .
this is a great question .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
it has billions of them .
did you see these guys ?
but there &apos;s something else .
here &apos;s another example .
is it photography at all ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
ohhh .
and then it became international .
there were remixes .
let me summarize it .
okay , a few more .
the answer to that is no .
just further . a lot of fun .
my name is amit .
he had the experience .
it keeps you fresh .
this is a great question .
is that your opinion ?
it &apos;s almost an identical structure .
and it was getting better .
that &apos;s what she did .
it &apos;s got a lot of love .
here you see the city .
good afternoon , all together .
am i going to like the color ?
ooh , thank you .
some have come and gone .
i don &apos;t think so much .
dk : 60,000 .
there &apos;s an old study .
don &apos;t be disappointed .
the game is from 2007 .
this is not true for emotions .
he &apos;s called paul offit .
so what do you think it happened ?
who will make it safe ?
first , we have the population .
i don &apos;t like that question .
but what are your fish eating ?
let &apos;s call it a don &apos;t .
this is precisely .
the work of interpreting .
but where are we useful ?
they had no mass media .
how do we actually work with people ?
... his own story is invent .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
so , what does that mean ?
well , what does that mean ?
private sphere has to be given .
there are online criminals .
we have three main groups .
it was still fish .
he always showed up here .
and then it happened again .
i felt really good .
and a lot of people forget this .
crisis . death . disaster .
it would be inertious .
it &apos;s not our fight .
it &apos;s not our problem .
we have lost contact .
why not think about it ?
we love technology and creativity .
it would be knowledge .
we &apos;re constantly pushing each other .
and this opens a map .
but what do we do with that ?
that &apos;s about it .
what do i look at ?
his name is tempt .
is it going to have my size ?
that sounds crazy , right ?
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
we need to spread the message .
that &apos;s what most of us know .
you also have to understand that .
this is what you see down there .
i want to ask you something .
i &apos;m going to stop this .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
i find this fascinating .
i find this fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was destroyed on the ground .
they look like this .
is it about the light ?
i grew up in india .
this is the short-term constitution .
you see the water coming .
i had a good life .
so what happened years after that ?
who are these related ?
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
these changes are coming in .
how about fitness ?
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
but the key is , ...
he works like this .
and then they put them up .
what &apos;s actually happening there ?
the orange feature .
they really loved it .
but i felt bad .
the two smells of me .
woman : overlaid technology .
very scary .
what &apos;s the soul ?
we don &apos;t produce more ourselves .
i can claim everything .
he went down and down .
what else can we do ?
this is what the graphics looked like .
now , i get to the end .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
it may sound candy .
we were 20 people .
so we &apos;re too many .
you can &apos;t have bones .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
or is it possible ?
conflicts emerge creativity .
so what do we need to do ?
they didn &apos;t have books .
this is felix .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
thank you for your attention .
that was the beginning of the journey .
i &apos;m honored .
and then everybody went down .
they saw the great proposition .
first length , second .
well , i was the next one .
you know , who &apos;s normal ?
and finally , episode .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
the same thing , just bigger .
who is the most successful ?
you want to feed the world ?
i wanted to support them .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
i just loved two .
one place is south korea .
again , they have it again .
this is a natural thing .
my wife told me .
and how did that feel ?
that &apos;s because you can train .
does it make curiosity ?
so it &apos;s &apos; circle .
so why are hacking now ?
this happened to be christmas .
what is it for a thing ?
that &apos;s about , you know .
they could have done better .
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
i don &apos;t have to worry .
and that &apos;s nothing else .
is that reasonable ?
so that &apos;s the good news .
it was a huge success .
so they saw something magic .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
but can &apos;t be a problem .
they &apos;re always saying , why ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
it was just not invented .
this is what some tasking should be working .
anybody know what this is ?
for example , this perception in context .
this is a game outside .
this is god , you know ?
but it was very sad .
so let me remind you .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
and is the x .
sometimes i push too much .
but they do do the job .
they &apos;re connected to these two people .
her mother moved her alone .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
think of your own decisions .
this picture is from this place .
i see this plumb sign .
and it took 18 months .
tell me about this world .
this is very risky .
and that worked very well .
again , it showed him four .
i learned everything out .
and there are hundreds of them .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there &apos;s good news .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
that really made me sad .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
but that &apos;s not going fast .
how can we help you ? &quot;
sometimes the illusion is the illusion .
no , no one had ever been an opportunity .
the story is not yet over .
what happened that day ?
well , then we want to .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
they come from the artists .
i should not say that .
the power plant can explode .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
she did it for three years .
you can have these cloud .
the data wasn &apos;t available before .
game is not silly .
well , how could this happen ?
is it all about education ?
how many people would vote creativity ?
so that &apos;s what we can do .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
they didn &apos;t changed the story .
everybody talks about happiness today .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
game doesn &apos;t just play child .
and that was 19 years ago .
which one would you like most ?
they create a episode story .
they have so much uncertainty .
the data is constantly illuminating .
no one has ever said that before .
so paul is a terrorist .
and this is what he actually says .
don &apos;t take anything from it .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what should our creature look like ?
this is a lot of volume .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
i &apos;m almost never cook with it .
she was back and die .
and of course , this is incredible .
and here &apos;s the representation .
it &apos;s not that soul .
an autistic student .
at the moment , that &apos;s garbage .
so not like detox .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
we depend on two countries .
everybody needs a gold glass .
let &apos;s be ownership . &quot;
people were still happy .
it was my first sunny .
in fact , he collected fish .
my name is brian goldman .
she shares her experiences with others .
the white lines are for population .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
he showed up the algae .
it &apos;s just not technological .
there are four and a half thousand people .
and already , you have a problem .
and we &apos;re very happy about that .
every case is nutrient .
and so we &apos;re too many .
so the question is : how ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and it was an incredible experience .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
but there are two problems .
i started feeling better .
but , you know what ?
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
that was a great thing .
i talk a lot about these questions .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
that &apos;s it , it &apos;s very simple .
we &apos;re in a field .
and that &apos;s what we did .
basically , they do the same thing .
this is now one of the images .
what else do we act like ?
and then something happened .
you can play with different ways .
the whole building was made of water .
italy wins . yeah .
on the morning , before the game .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
creativity had to somehow get out .
now , everything is easy to have .
asked the nurse .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
maybe even in our cell phones .
and it starts with a doctor .
i &apos;m going to stand up with you .
we use the energy of the sun .
these are all metadata .
because i can say everything .
it &apos;s always going to be similar .
but slowly it turns out to be .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work , right ?
what are they trying to do ? &quot;
that &apos;s what we &apos;re not going to do .
what lessons have we learned ?
and the shape plays a role .
you can &apos;t store energy .
then i can transmit this whole thing .
okay , that &apos;s really courageous .
once we started a violin .
my second mistake was worse .
and she &apos;s going to have a 257 .
we all love baseball , right ?
somehow , kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
that &apos;s about five meters long .
they &apos;re going to be free in the computer .
because does anyone have masses ?
and then refusing it .
they shouldn &apos;t suffer other things .
this has the greatest impact .
the motions , they write it .
anyway , not to navigate .
and that &apos;s all in the beginning .
the truth is more like this .
do you want to do jeans ?
you can &apos;t do anything like that .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
her family gathered .
thank you very much for your patience .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
what else is risky ?
be easy , who you are .
i remember my first fire .
what &apos;s a story called ?
he &apos;s dark . dark .
i was trying to do something exciting .
but very , very effective , yes ?
but we need the total .
nuclear missions , yes ?
this is completely ugly .
let &apos;s think about that .
hmmm , my brand ?
this is frightening .
that sounds frightening .
next : nuclear energy .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
i was really going to be normal at that time .
so i &apos;m going to show you now .
once the judge saw me .
we can &apos;t just do that .
so i went to court .
i got a little scared of technology .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
and there are several reasons for this .
they sell certificates .
it &apos;s not documented .
why did i go to medicine ?
it can know where we are .
it spreads out of lawns .
all adults have been aware of risks .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i like things that are different .
i went to prison -- difficult .
it didn &apos;t make any sense in my eyes .
this is a child game , right ?
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
and this video is in real time .
the game starts -- swiss .
you can &apos;t have any teeth .
what about longevity ?
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
so the correlation is lower .
so , look what happens .
so the dynamics really changed .
so i just started playing .
and then we said , okay .
yes , these are the data .
i &apos;m going to shoot something through the head .
have you ever been discriminate ?
this is like learning by the weekend .
because for me , it means memory .
how and what did he feel ?
we say in germany sustainability .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
music is medicine . music changes us .
it &apos;s really hard to figure out .
and do you know what i learned ?
these will be unresistant .
but what will come to the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
this has nothing to do with science .
and that can make a big difference .
but there &apos;s another reason .
anyway , we need a solution .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
so i &apos;m listening to a lot .
they got the channels .
in the assumption , maybe two percent .
we started 15 years ago .
how far do you get there ?
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
you know what &apos;s neither ?
so the first step to a interpretation .
and it &apos;s still not a interpretation .
that has to be the difference .
if you come to that , yes ?
you can show me , i was there .
that &apos;s just the minimum .
we can win our nutrients back .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
on the book and on the picture .
this picture reminded me of something .
i think they &apos;re abandoned .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but maybe this is not the case .
and what does this mean for the designers ?
i want to prove that to you .
it was a pretty destiny project .
here it leaves the sun to go .
this is storing the memory .
these rivers take the rivers .
a has these benefits and risks .
our newscrapers are read by millions .
lego made it possible for everybody .
privacy is not a debate .
they had been exposed to genetically .
i &apos;m the new doctor .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
baseball is full of great statistics .
because we live on a water planet .
do we really want to go to that direction ?
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
this gave them a evolutionary advantage .
and these are the neural structures .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
oh , my time is over ?
something worries to me .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
so we measured his movement .
this is a picture of the object .
apparently it was pretty popular .
you see something fun here .
i really like beautiful clothes .
he can only use his eyes .
but the truth is far away .
you can do that all the time .
so this crazy story could be true .
who would ever want to wish ?
the dutch would have been too easy .
her father died shortly after her birth .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a cents .
we need to increase complexity slowly .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
here &apos;s their marrow melting .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
but then they really want to go deep .
they want to be oriented in the museum ?
that was more to concrete .
okay , you really want to know this ?
and i had to get away from the city .
we won some prices .
who doesn &apos;t want to change children ?
it makes globe with kids .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
no , i mean it really seriously .
i hold the knife in my hand .
and the goal is very simple .
i recruit my sleeve .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
now , i see greg moon .
a billion people are hungry today .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
i loved this fish .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and this sounds very different than before .
he was already talking about sixth .
i created a institutional institute .
they even get funding with them .
the film hasn &apos;t been done yet .
we need to think about what marks .
what do you do with it ? &quot;
i call this the radically puzzle .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
this is ideology , not science .
and that made me go through each other .
today , 6.8 billion people .
that &apos;s how it &apos;s going to come .
it &apos;s busy making sense .
the hot projections today .
automatically , he walks to the right idea .
this is the nature of things .
but it requires a lot of planning .
we can invent everything again .
as we think of from north .
and it depends on phosphorus .
often in the third , again , forget .
longer than those two networks .
the stones are colored .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
it &apos;s about changing value .
i started with my usual talk .
this is a very sensitive question .
i learned this from my grandmother .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
we haven &apos;t written this app .
and every morning i jump to it .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
the geese is very good .
which words would you describe ?
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
there &apos;s also a world record .
to ask , what &apos;s the right thing ?
people over the urges .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
the living ones are the spirits .
they gave their blood pressure .
thank you , but the best one is .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
happy productivity . fantastic !
the result of this was catastrophic .
and everyone in this room has to come in .
here &apos;s the olive oil .
bjn villages .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
risk is not a simple game .
in fact , we have redefined poverty .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
we already have a lot of procedure .
this is maybe being transmitted in public .
my brother stared at me .
these are the apsaras .
i talked a lot about magic .
who could have this all look forward ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who do you actually want to inform it ?
it &apos;s a fully destined destination .
what do you think happens next ?
they have them . they always have them .
so this is a hard guy .
it &apos;s been constant .
they literally took the shirt .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
most of all , when he died .
so , it &apos;s two circles .
the byproduct is clean water .
that sounds very unusual for the first time .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you always lose rare animals .
it &apos;s going to be deeply tougher .
he died through the story .
here &apos;s how the building works .
they drill through each other .
tell you what you feel .
the other one had died off .
let &apos;s do a little interacting .
here you have this little mechanism .
he &apos;s got melted .
the one is interested in the firemen .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
the students will be divided to grades .
these things are logical .
and here you feel it already .
for energy , i noticed this .
i tried to understand them .
all these generations need just a few milliseconds .
and no one seems to be aware of it .
that i wrote these crazy things .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
that &apos;s just a little less destroy .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t allow themselves to learn .
it &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
a dalmatina , right .
you can see first from the back to the front .
so from modern into the computer society .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
we have to come far , and quickly .
it &apos;s about a neutraction of america .
they &apos;re all concerned questions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they are the home countries of somebody .
we go through initiational rituals .
now look at this curve .
wiwizard just belong to our lives .
i stayed people in death cells .
they kept us from being inspired .
i think some mutations might be a couple of mutations .
so scott gets this annie fruit .
we worked until late late in the night .
so i followed my building feeling .
he moved back to silence .
now we saw the reverse effect .
polite is all applause .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
so ... so , not so optimistic .
he picks up the crayons .
let &apos;s start with the real estate .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
they had a concept of blue blood .
i believed everyone could do that .
i never met him personally .
even cats look at this video .
there was jimmy kimpaired .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
how would you describe your brand ?
we talk about cool , fresh .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
no , that was what i thought .
i &apos;m a redundant person .
that &apos;s not the route .
this is a painting of a circle .
the roof was also covered with water .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
and women argued the successful .
we can support them to be good .
look at what she &apos;s doing .
the main man came to me .
sexual sequestration is going into the picture .
i read them in front of them .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
that &apos;s the truth . i believe .
we &apos;re talking about twenty of it .
it was really incredibly profound .
he shaped his head , no .
that &apos;s going to take place in the next april .
we also got very accurate data .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
the mechanism comes out of the gap .
but with the right design , please .
we can support them to be good .
to say , what &apos;s information ?
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
there was never been a time like this .
and even lomg thinks about .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
and also , these options are underlying .
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
this is an ecological network .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
the chef had cooked him .
you put it in the box .
this is such a tray part .
the one that &apos;s been represented right now .
what takes five million seconds ?
i see the dalmater .
it may be , until it &apos;s invited .
maybe again , a look behind it .
no , no , far away .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
156 nations send our tv channel .
they appointed their internet connection .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
she was not yet disappointed .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
this is the system where we live .
but i kept on asking myself this question .
and that was what i felt .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
what will these three billion people bring ?
you also want to make you want .
something very strange is happening here .
and that was the outbreak of that .
i learned a few very simple things .
it can know how to keep it .
so it creates a back-to-head .
boston didn &apos;t just have a prayer center .
this is a little app .
the ujaw comes from another place .
&quot; they don &apos;t let go . &quot;
i lived in parallels .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and i &apos;d like to read you the forward .
there &apos;s another aspect in history .
you can be logical and intuitive .
tell me a little bit about this part .
make it possible -- all of you here .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
does anyone know what this is ?
so this is the reason for this project .
it &apos;s called &quot; jump with me . &quot;
let me tell you a little bit about this .
states don &apos;t exist in us .
we &apos;re still coming back to these people .
we can do something like this .
so the first exciting thing was .
and there &apos;s a way to think about staff .
daniel kahneman : sure .
everyone would like to make people happier .
and the dosization plays a role .
and why ? intelligent food changed .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
we have masses now in this country .
not even the truth will be free .
because now you can apply a three-sentence .
you see the timeline up .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
thank you , danny kaman .
we &apos;re going to get an absolutely flat line of it .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
because we don &apos;t want to shoot genes ?
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t do that much .
they run the process , they understand it .
there &apos;s a lot of things that need to come together .
and what do you do with the garbage ?
bad ? i was completely confused .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and then he can walk away .
a particularly beautiful story , like i mean .
his personal emissions of the erotic erosion .
i &apos;m trying to do this for a second .
it just has to work as a present .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
this is an annual submersible .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
it &apos;s a small virus of bacteria .
now this level of intuition is going to be very important .
so littable open source is open source .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
they grow five centimeters .
maybe i did it with good reason .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
let &apos;s get something different now .
it &apos;s all coming out of our own pockets .
normal people are not accessible these devices . &quot;
as an artist , it &apos;s very important to me .
here you see roberto dance .
and no matter , italy won the end .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
but the game is a forum .
thank you . i have a question to you .
he had 20 minutes of music .
well , i &apos;m going to show you .
this is just an insurance method .
it should contain the two elements .
shake the environment , make less waste .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to talk about .
yeah . she doesn &apos;t discover anything else .
the goal of the film is transparency .
a language is the expression of the human mind .
it was an acoustic barrier .
what you need is a new medical culture .
alone , damaged and without support .
do you want to come and listen to that ? &quot;
i think our identity is threatened .
a lot of my clients are very young .
my cousins around everywhere .
we saw some fantastic presentations .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
here are two different jewelry charges .
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i have him here on my laptop . &quot;
i &apos;m going to negotiate directly with the artist .
a whole shock of cool food .
the difference will be perceived as loss .
in two hours , they build themselves everywhere .
the emergency room moved all the strands .
no insurance can make up .
there &apos;s a lot of great books to this topic .
so this was a problem for supercomputers .
this country is different from 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of slave family .
you can predict that . why is that ?
how do i take application ?
it &apos;s great that this number rises .
isn &apos;t half or a quarter ? &quot;
so what can we conclude from all that ?
so basically , a translation of translation .
no tree is carbon neutral .
and further , now look at it .
the next step has happened now in this communities .
he &apos;d invited a lot of natural videos .
that &apos;s just the day of the day .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
this really triggered the fuel problem .
and ecologist was a disaster .
this is one , part of her .
it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
in other areas -- the world of communication .
this is my supermarket . no big .
but western governments also help themselves .
battlefield is ubiquitous .
i &apos;m going to get tired , as we all do .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
if you burn coal , no .
tell you , there &apos;s no predictions .
can you play them now in blue ?
no , we &apos;re stuck , which is in there .
and there &apos;s a central point there .
it &apos;s just because everybody &apos;s eaten .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
now , what are archaic models ?
and the list can be continued .
so , that was my primary motivation .
care about america . find more .
and the problem is not the technology .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we asked around , and nobody knew it .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
monday : color is something more powerful .
it &apos;s got us in a certain way .
and then it looks like this in the rule .
do you remember the skull ?
so , help me a little bit .
imagine mozart kind of efficient .
i &apos;m happy that i &apos;m there .
water amounts have increased .
they care about that we &apos;re getting worse .
man 3 : i &apos;m the museum museum .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a license .
indoors have evolved the instruments .
i just want to explain to you a little bit .
in fact , there was no viral video to do .
in this three-sentence , three sentences come in front of you .
you know , three sentence still out of school .
you can zoom out very easily and zoom out .
now i add a bass to it .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
if not , jellyfish today , somebody else .
this is the machine outside of geneva .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
they laughed more than they do here .
your problem is you have too little .
thirdly , escalation of expectations .
the official dogma of what ?
they only listen to them , and then they begin to speak .
let me show you how they work .
it &apos;s a game called the following .
i call them &quot; the income billion . &quot;
we think of energy today .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
you go around and you feel overwhelmed .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
that &apos;s what &apos;s built in the city .
second time . at the end of the normal game .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
just imagine that for a moment .
raise your hands . let me see you .
maybe we can see wizard change as change .
it &apos;s not much better .
people were fighting . people were fighting .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
you know that science is not a company .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so , that really struck me .
i tried to preserve the body .
life had not changed for centuries .
but there were so many revenue about the years .
my grandmother never forgotten me .
my fourth technique : predictions for complexity .
third technology : categorization .
it captures a thousand square kilometers .
you come up with two -- very simple .
you should tell me something about my brand .
it was something we knew to do .
but reality is always unpredictable .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
donnerday : self-confidence is the key .
they are in the back of our body .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
i wanted to restore health after a disease .
now , if you keep thinking a little bit further .
what ? that really made me out of it .
we refuse smart food .
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
we forced them down . puff .
my parents are the 80 on the ferrors .
and there &apos;s no doubt problem .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drinking information . &quot;
you can jump directly to a certain output .
you can dive into a particular year .
because it &apos;s done with it , isn &apos;t it ?
shake the environment , the energy needs less energy .
this is called the osit-model model .
now , look at the dalmatina .
and the last two are also here today .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
this has to go down , down to zero .
but i didn &apos;t let myself discourage .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
and in time , they can react to others .
our goal was easy to say , okay .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go further .
all of this is composable .
it &apos;s all in there , it &apos;s useful .
this is being spent in china in a second .
the phosphorus problem is much critical .
anyway , they do this in the middle .
the thumb is marked with red .
and if not , still dance your dance .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
seriously -- encouraging the gang !
well , this cartoon makes some exceptions .
here &apos;s a couple on the hampton .
so this is how the supermarket is .
i thought i could integrate myself .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the three words said , do you remember ?
i remember when it was yesterday .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
well , i joined the courtyard .
i said , &quot; ok , oma . &quot;
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition .
i work in the solar technology industry .
and let me show you a simple example .
but it has an unexpected twist .
so it made sense , it made fit together .
yet , we seem to be quite satisfied with this .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
scott signs from man to human .
and here &apos;s every piece of work very well .
after that , it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
is it about the details or the colors ?
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
no one needs to give up ideas .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
i think i might have heard more hands .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
eeeeee ! no , thank you .
and this is a millionaire .
so at this point , we need digital security systems .
so again , the appropriate really good together .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
intersexuality comes in many different forms .
so they go off ; they save the shoes .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
we &apos;ve been here for 130,000 years .
what we want to do is create the future .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in the real life .
there &apos;s a lot of happy coaching .
let me show you a couple of them .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
commend . damaged .
we &apos;ve gotten rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
they were just like the people in this room .
my grandparents were urging this number to 70 .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
we need to use more research for more research .
there &apos;s every footprint there .
i would normally take the needle out .
there &apos;s somebody sitting behind , who had no childhood .
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
let &apos;s do this as if we had a machine .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
this is going to be a key element of this stuff .
they live with chemosynthesis .
i was totally thrilled , you know .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
and every night they fly 240 miles back .
every morning , they fly 240 miles to the farm .
what &apos;s the bureaucracy ? &quot;
natural light then offers smartphones .
this is what nobody did in the world .
picasso answered , just wait .
we create new tensions and conflicts .
the topic of ecology is a global issue .
now , i &apos;m going to do something more striking .
they &apos;re all back to their way back .
and they had to remove what we did .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we just signed up .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
so you can &apos;t put them wrong around .
what do you do with certificate ?
this is alfred alez .
there can be a series of changes .
and this is very important in medical research .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for this .
what would you say to somebody who believes that ?
and then he whisked me into the ear .
the rest of the time , they &apos;re delay .
i start with some simple examples .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
the question is why people accept that .
and i went back to work .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silicon .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
then i wonder , how could this happen ?
first of all , i thought that would be a game .
the storyteller takes more and more senses .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on with another generation .
today , a lot of people have given the government .
the next week comes up to the market .
she &apos;s got a button , / off .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the performance .
the first is a classic , apple .
it &apos;s the way i &apos;d like to be .
these things have a positive effect .
no one wanted to do something with the film .
what do you think the answer will be ?
on the left , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s why i think we need to be leaders .
so we have this horrible simplistic idea .
so two pairs , every desk , every baby .
ladies and gentlemen , their relations .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
it was the idea of the imagination .
the best one is -- in one second .
so every concert is a different concert .
so not saving , fuzzy , avoid it .
and everything is packaged or content .
i could cheat directly to my house . &quot;
and that argument is not a sense .
they support others when they talk about their mistakes .
i made them and made me go to treatment .
do you know how to call a 4000-pound ?
notice two things on that curve .
and i have to say , there was power .
my mother was the youngest of her children .
at 16 , i started to illustrate books .
that our contribution to the system is choose .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
he has not come out in other countries .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
i never want to move anything different in life .
so i spoke a few months later at a conference .
so they communicate -- that &apos;s how their fingers go along .
i want to show you something very first .
and of course , it did , but then click .
it was summer and i had shots .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
and they &apos;re not just going to die of masses .
what happened is that we could do that .
they don &apos;t spend time in power .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . i put on .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
anyway , that &apos;s what i want to do .
technical circles are the same .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge for nine .
i put it in particular .
at the beginning of the tribal society through language .
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
so they &apos;re supposed to come from outside to the people .
we don &apos;t invent identity ; we invent them .
it was a lot , and i was in eighth .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to recognize from this pattern .
he came to me and hugged me .
they were all the people who started to share .
but it &apos;s definitely not a optimal situation .
i &apos;m really sorry . does that make you crazy ?
over the country , she would roll up .
so smartphones , a huge topic everywhere .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
we want to do something about death penalty companies .
there &apos;s a couple of interesting developments there .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet , there is a realistic level .
so the theme of the day : financial saving .
in fact , no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
and we need to improve a lot of this device .
it was created four and a half years ago in italy .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
this is a problem that many players have .
the last three of the five have i put in .
let &apos;s just look at the ecological model .
now , the rest of those , the rest of it .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
well , what &apos;s the brand of marry ?
i &apos;d like to help you calm down .
both of them are survival , both of them .
as i said , amanda wearing our election .
there were no canadian border .
did you take all your vitamins this morning ?
so this was a very strange experience .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
we have 20 percent in germany .
these wind are all over the place to go virtually .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
the only thing that they had was their head .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
this is a dead turtle .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
i have something that i want to show you .
how would it be longer to live in good health ?
we don &apos;t want companies to patent life .
and i found this incredibly exciting .
they have the flow of the water .
so , we can &apos;t do these things .
in the countries where people come to money .
and what does it look like in this ?
we understood that the weather is global .
and in this head , the memory was happening .
you saw it in the news .
this is a completely unsustainable pattern .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
everyone in my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
that means we need to get back phosphorus .
well , would you choose the same vacation ?
there seems to be an imperative .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
we &apos;ve done it over the last 11,000 years .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
now you understand the advantage of the prototype .
this is the u.s. for hundreds of years .
i think the first thing is the curiosity .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
but maybe you can vote them too .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
not everything is natural to be composable .
if you fall in love , efficient ?
and we see that it goes through .
because we don &apos;t really feel effective .
yeah , so what should biohacking ?
here are some people who test it .
the fact is , coal is not dirty .
there are the ones that are much more spatial .
the main headquarters are right here .
i thought he would have kidney stones .
and feedback to my upper doctor .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
we want to reduce the number of gaps .
swiss is othly concrete .
the closet of dna was an interesting step .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
but what happens with &quot; discrete &quot; is different .
i was not familiar with the label .
no apple has ever been smashed like this .
good night , candle . &quot;
now he takes a tractor into the scene .
and they also feel their movements and their movements .
when your job is dancing , dance .
so we complained about 50 of the magnets .
these are footage of six seconds .
but let &apos;s not always be that bad thing .
in our own countries , we would never do anything like this .
they become rare because we &apos;re going to catch them .
so you don &apos;t often lose the animals .
all of these are errors inevitable .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
i remember when it was yesterday .
and i &apos;m going to figure out a character in the book .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
so every pile was a little different .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
i put my job at 95 kg .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
we found that it really moves strange .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
the answer will probably be &quot; no . &quot;
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
this is something like our fight .
so they can raise the whole movement .
here are the results that we &apos;ve just gotten .
but how do you do that in practice ?
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
i want to do it by not getting stars . &quot;
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
that &apos;s the problem that i try to solve .
this is not about how happy a person lives .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
... that also the doses play a role .
probably many of you know this in the room .
yes , they &apos;re right . we &apos;re going to fix this .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
well , i understand that . i do that .
the marshmallow needs to be low up .
it &apos;s really very important that we &apos;re going to get there .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
i &apos;m talking to you today about energy and climate .
these stupid movies don &apos;t bring us any money .
i can do the sequence as they &apos;re walking away .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
for nathaniel , music means serious health .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have anymore ?
because in fact , this person is not interested in evidence .
because without those lifespan , we can &apos;t live .
he &apos;s just disappointing them and not themselves .
why do i have to afford that little car ?
a phrase with his own breath .
interpretation of interpretation is barely spoken in the early class .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
and in my youth , i said , expectations .
it &apos;s sort of about a coordination of smallpox .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
or they didn &apos;t have a photogray gray .
and that all leads us to the big question ...
they virtual reality and they do it without computers .
yeah , what kind of projects we &apos;re doing now ?
and the world in which we lived in .
and we can navigate in a very simple way .
if you commit it , that &apos;s what happens .
and that was not hard to get diagnosed .
i was a 20-obsessed student .
all right , really good , maybe an all-star .
wealth , not debt , affecting the result .
she had the last word in every family argument .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we use this word with this kind of contempt .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and that worked . applause for scott .
i met the decision to move to the united states .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
or are they more like a down-attribute ?
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
so what are we going to see in the movie ?
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve figured it out .
and that &apos;s the planning behind it .
i learned that in a moment , everything else is different .
each polberg has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
look , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
it &apos;s natching , and it &apos;s just natocity .
we have the passion of a divine innovators .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
we want to create mass intangibles . &quot;
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
now we &apos;re doing this with drills and machines .
this is the call center for service and information .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
we have all the navigation systems in our cars .
but at the same time , we know that &apos;s not possible .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , let me show you a little bit more about this .
here we were , and this is the painting .
emma says , &quot; make transparency welcome . &quot;
there was a lot of crazy stuff going on there .
from the avian age to the machine age .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same thing in the disabled movement .
but are we going to do the best of our game ?
8,000 players play the game for eight weeks .
so we have about 1.5 billion players .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
but one of them is worse than the others .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
i thought we &apos;re going to put the pokermit in the same way .
there &apos;s a connection to each other , a mutual respect .
and so i met a little unusual decision .
so my two passionate passions flew in .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
i don &apos;t know who you know this picture .
i only agree , that &apos;s logical .
i think it seems to be both of you .
the question of death penalty is an interesting question .
the child in me is really thrilled to me .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamics .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
i &apos;m going to talk today about unexpected discoveries .
the underwater part is from a quarter .
when i say reality , i mean photo-real reality .
at the moment , we are far away from this goal .
and how was that for you ? what successful ?
a little bit more about you , not you are .
it was in eternal , forever .
tuesday : adapting is totally overwhelmed .
the dog ! i was linguistic .
would you like to be attractive and more confident ?
she had barely gone and walked blue .
people come to the door now .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
they need that , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
and some of it has worked and mankind .
so we walk away from it , and where do we walk ?
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
we wanted to develop a learning tools for language .
i may have another 40 years of work in me .
you know what the answer to this question is ?
if you want to build hyperlinks between the images .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not perceived as big loss .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
that &apos;s the kind of teaching richer .
and fortunately , there &apos;s a whole bunch of studies now .
and we learn trust and the rules of play .
probably one of those numbers must be very close to zero .
and i said , &quot; yes , very much . &quot;
you can say things in the world that have influence worldwide .
... you could just just show the slide .
just as much as i think we &apos;re putting games today .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the need of aid .
and i went over and listened to just .
it also shows up to other places of the book .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
these results were reached by several weeks of hard work .
this player is about to be a episode .
why do i do that ? what comes out of it ? &quot;
there &apos;s a program that might be familiar with some .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
you probably know that he was 35 .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of it .
my mother suffered from the boat .
these are the people who look at my global view .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the bordder .
we see that in all kinds of different areas of human life .
and it was also after the three months .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent .
the main problem here is kind of like aids .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any statement about the reality .
there &apos;s a nice concrete example of this .
then i say , heart disease , yes ?
and we &apos;re trying to figure out how often we want .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing kids to the world .
his legacy process has changed after that .
i said , &quot; dear , oma . &quot;
it &apos;s worthwhile and weird programs .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
but what this picture says is a problem .
there are some places that we can apply to .
we called it the digital civil pavilion .
because they have special skills of processing .
so here are some natural worms .
the second factor is the services we use .
this changed my way of making films completely , completely .
it &apos;s hard to overcome the destruction .
so you could feel like you were able to sell it .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
that means the ants weigh much more than we do .
and we can look at this now .
gee and jellyfish cohen .
so , raise them and start to invent them .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
this is an idea that is worth spreading .
so imagine only two other little changes .
how many would you choose a good memory ?
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s like .
so please listen to if a music is played .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any statement about what &apos;s true .
the first two sentences that are logical .
in fact , we know that something else is the case .
now this should actually be not a joke , but it &apos;s not .
and then they do that once , and then they experience the sentence .
we can do these things on different examples .
what we love to do is to love the nightmare .
they moved to a natural concept .
so these women were wearing themselves , and they were just holding themselves .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and we &apos;ve designed an ipad app .
darwines and sponsors were donated .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzles .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you zoom in . you can actually go in .
you can see in all these museums there .
how much money is needed to realize that ?
think about it . this attack is generic .
and if it doesn &apos;t , it doesn &apos;t matter .
so we &apos;re going to start with a windmill .
he says , &quot; give up a plumbing . &quot;
imagine a soundscape plane .
it &apos;s a totally denial of miserable .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to continue .
this is another look at the tree of life .
they divided the kingdom into two containers .
this is one of the classical expressions of play .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
we had no child paralysis in this country yesterday .
and i used a while to figure that out .
we repeated these practice with the same students .
you have to be willing to take risks like this .
&quot; look at your belly , pink .
there &apos;s no overpopulation problem with trees .
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s been a change .
and the third area that actually explains itself .
i &apos;m looking forward to talking to all of you .
each big picture is the beginning of a disk .
you wouldn &apos;t like to starve , and you know what ?
or are they more like a down-10 tribe ?
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
that &apos;s the consequence that we need to make .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i said , &quot; please fly in the air . &quot;
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
play is the kitt that holds us both .
if you give something to you , give it to you now .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
they teach them to open up themselves .
antony : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
and here are two patients . these are their records .
i mean , this is a real cognitive drive .
i think that &apos;s true for everybody on the planet .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
so , a climate change becomes terrible for you .
i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times .
i can &apos;t say if it &apos;s good or bad .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
it grows in the winter and grows in summer .
not only bad , but the worst of all times .
everybody knew their genius was a little laughing .
we repaired them , repair them .
and the world in which we live now looks like this .
but these are all roads in the u.s. .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
child mortality has increased a tenth .
that &apos;s where it comes back .
maniok is something that is half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
and you know what my answer to all of this is ?
we walk into the arms of placebo industry .
in nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
where is the biggest interest of what really is ?
moreover , the energy episode is very important to them .
we went back to the cave of titanic .
because artists have a local relationship to lying .
and at all , you &apos;re working much less than i do .
or b , because they don &apos;t learn to sing ?
i &apos;m never going to play any more like this right now .
it &apos;s the form of refour behavior , yes ?
and less usable or user , it &apos;s friendly .
how can i make some user friendly ?
i don &apos;t see why it &apos;s not supposed to be .
so how do we work if we look in there ?
every society is preoccupied by a primarily .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
we &apos;re now focusing on the power generation .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built watermarks .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
you get a model that is made out of the earth .
the grandfather of this old man &apos;s old man refused .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
so in other words , i definitely want to do what i want .
and i see the same process in combination of photos .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it was looked at nearly 200 million times a year .
they had 348 different kinds of signature .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
paralysis is a sequence of too many choices .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
he described one of them as very common .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
on a spot , the screen filled with leaves .
so the pygecology movement has done it .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
this year , it was looked at almost 50 million times .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
the views of the audience were very serious and attention .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
we should put the baker in the cage .
are you eight and monolly like 2,000 ?
the living self has no voice in this choice .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
and in the world , everything made sense for me .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
quotes , in a moment of head .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
and no , it &apos;s not a either you or san francisco .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open them doors ?
here &apos;s the current version of this contract .
it was a extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
and that was , in fact , the first of people were developed tools .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
you never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen rarely flat lines .
i take that hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
and the film is called &quot; the moral framework . &quot;
well , in this area , there are not several thousand goals .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 headlines .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
well , we introduced the mayor hole .
well today , we know everything about where our things come from .
france makes a tor . italy makes a gate .
how do you divide people because of their characteristics ?
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressive vity .
he picks up every fifth hope from my consciousness .
is it a lot of money , or is it affecting us ?
so i say , let &apos;s start the world change .
edward cava is a volumes scientist .
at the moment , we spend three billion hours per week playing online .
the biggest difference between them is the transition with time .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
bg : a energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t borrow you .
with pivot , they can dive into a decade .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s a little bit radically radical .
so i &apos;ve channessed lots of fish in my life .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
in fact , the notes are very disgusting and unprecedented .
because we don &apos;t do things anymore .
there &apos;s a little bit more to my glasses .
as i said , two thousand times has started .
this is an interactive film maneuver .
and ol√© ! do it for you , despite the channel .
i &apos;m still going to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and everybody knew it worked like this , right ?
i would continue to do this work that i love .
and the question is , are these good or bad news ?
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
here &apos;s , &quot; touch your fingers on every light . &quot;
the next step was to find the apps for this .
we know one more thing where everyone gets gas .
so you &apos;re just going to google first project .
what metamorphosis have you run through ?
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
this constant feedback is not in real life .
i &apos;m going to explain it for you , and then explain it .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
a research mester to the subject of natural interface .
i &apos;m also going to resolve the same thing in there .
you don &apos;t know anything in this goldfish . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great things .
in the future , most crimes are going to play online .
we had no words for what we started there .
now , it &apos;s on the red list of dangerous species .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
but i really believe that after us , there &apos;s something else .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
the cell communities started to abstract information again .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital thing that &apos;s true .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the lead rat .
&quot; don &apos;t go , &quot; it &apos;s untrue .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the brick .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still put together .
also , urban designers and construction are very interested .
there &apos;s not even online . there &apos;s no extension .
it doesn &apos;t work for the memory itself .
our steps in the digital life were exponential .
this is star night , probably never seen before .
in the course of this discovery , i learned a lot .
as a child , i drew comic books and so on .
when we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
right now , this is our goal .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
we advised only there like otherwise .
a lot of people talk about 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
i was quite rightly obsessed with the deep ocean .
so when sound says there &apos;s no soul .
this is actually the hardest part of my talk .
i can &apos;t play like 20 years now .
both of them would sit on me , ask me .
so a lot of testosterone , but not reaction to it .
so the growth rate is accelerating itself .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my head .
11m is the highest thing i saw .
a &quot; manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
that &apos;s why the weighs to think .
these are spaces that can respond to intelligent people .
well , how do people die in such a hack ?
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and you can see this green point there in the middle .
i sold field museum animals all over the world .
this is my meat , and i can turn it around .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
no , that &apos;s the right thing , right ?
many of you are covered by faces .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
in both cases , surgery was operated , and it was very good to them .
she didn &apos;t have a treatable brain damage .
the ethnic sphere is the great legacy of humanity .
and the fish also was fortunate to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the numbers of language .
it was the missing cross for drugs .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
there &apos;s more to it , it &apos;s still deeper .
but we just know a little bit about where things go .
ok , imagine how extreme self-assembly motivates .
i know what people think when they see that .
ask questions , ask evidence , desire .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
everything in life is beautiful , isn &apos;t efficient .
as early as it used to happen in the village .
this is what happened to be the old machine age .
there &apos;s a political translation in our country .
they put them on the beatrical machine .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental disorder .
it could happen within a time period of learning .
... the crowdsource of crowdsourcing .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
i worked in a coal mining -- dangerous .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
and he said , &quot; right ? &quot;
that means go back to the board .
so , as a human being goes on with certain things .
and , of course , how do design impact on perception .
but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
it &apos;s just breathtaking .
lawyer : i &apos;m a lawyer .
we have an abstract abstract language .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
but in fact , it was a big fun last night .
we had to worry about the lawyers .
it was called the automatically synthetic stone .
inotinus is a certified place .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was once different .
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to do ?
he took a famous photograph . how was it ?
they slow down to one of our big problems .
we see the process that feed itself .
thylacines ? yes . alive ? yale .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we &apos;re doing .
but you can combine something special about this .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
because the images eat it for them to recommend .
hey , and wumms , you &apos;re in the museum .
the idea is to translate a digital security system .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimation .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain it .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphor .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
in fact , the advanced society is based on energy terms .
this was not a film , no hd , that was real .
i wasn &apos;t there a long time ago with miguel .
because you know , that &apos;s a fun process .
have you ever seen a clineutral tree ?
there &apos;s exactly the same thing i &apos;ve described .
if you want to come too far , you get cow together . &quot;
it &apos;s new america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
frost , the carbon man will clean every day .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
so i &apos;m going to step back and look at the other way .
i filmed in war areas -- difficult and dangerous .
so we should soon figure out what the goal is .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
if we &apos;re building cities , that &apos;s actually a big thing .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
in other words , game is our adaptation .
can you imagine something good that comes out of tobacco ?
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds on their pain .
you can just call some names , and people will understand .
diphy , rose , child paralysis ...
this is a variation of a thing that was made .
well , the energy episode is over time .
and it was an experience that could not give me hollywood .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
it caused immense jewelry in the control room .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s this contribution , aspirate taste .
the gardens eat the physical lankton .
and so he &apos;s flying his elderly .
and then there &apos;s a lot of simulations of simulations .
but it wasn &apos;t that much in the years .
the musician is the extension of our body .
he only lived for three years .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
a baby needs about a sixth of a windmill .
so i know about some of the ones that haven &apos;t been involved .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here to be gone .
it &apos;s like asking someone to beat the sun .
please follow me , because the circle will be close .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
this is an idiotic debate . she has to stop .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of them .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
i have a friend who drives a passereni .
it &apos;s not just a nice soundscape .
and because we &apos;re getting older , the wind gets bigger .
this is the time period where you fall in love .
and we &apos;re still very , very strong with stories today .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and the predictions of how you read them are serious .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
and i don &apos;t expect that this will ever change .
it &apos;s also my big , life-long love and fascination .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
why are they going to be around us if we can &apos;t buy ?
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
a few years ago , i started developing lifespan .
the broad sends you still feel untouched .
my grandfather was in the prohibition in prison .
she was a tape , strong woman , she had effect .
so , in some sense , mattered us to do the technology .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
but what if you want to see the paintings ?
but my logical side has not liked it .
i just want to say a little bit about saldlows .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . heart desire .
we &apos;ve also brought dragging to design schools .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to deal with injustice .
my uncle died of alcohol diseases .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also worrying .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a multi-story community .
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
let &apos;s call the animal mind , it costs a lot of money .
if a neighbor helps the other , we strengthen our communities .
ohhhh , wwwwww !
they always worry that they lose galleries .
50 percent of their decisions were hit within nine minutes or less .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and my talk today is mostly going to fall by these cognitive things .
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collecting collections .
open the map , jump with a click .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a lot of transparency on transparency .
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
you could also use ordinary design -- technology to spread .
one of my friends has done it -- richard nightmares .
imagine these things that could actually begin to fly .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
these are the kinds of questions that we need to face .
i was fascinated by the elephant and beauty of biology .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
and this is from a economist . so it &apos;s logical .
i mean , how much toes do we remember our memories ?
the more money you make is satisfaction .
that our survival of all the survival is connected to each individual .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
right , bryan , the judge has magic .
and yes , i have a task , as you might recognize .
secondly , photos should have the same kind of lighting .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s totally logical .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be there .
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of statements .
and the movie is going to be called &quot; the curve . &quot;
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
just that i think it &apos;s more like it , not true .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
i hope you enjoy it . thank you very much .
but it turns out that that &apos;s not all .
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why are we fighting that ?
this is a lot of tode through masks , 20 an hour .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my death .
because they &apos;re the ones who are experts too for taste .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
i mentioned this to miguel and he would take a nightmare .
so the more the bars are , the more the system . &quot;
and then i immediately feel that this is unfair .
and also what they would think in the mind today .
and oil is what we &apos;re going to replace through other energy systems .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t do it .
like algae -- and others have terrible things .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
it was completely closed that it could fail to fail .
so that made me really crazy , and i wanted to get more .
and immediately i see a different pattern that &apos;s available .
yeah , this is what it looks like at the bottom is the load .
it &apos;s not about resource efficiency , it &apos;s efficiency .
we &apos;ve been used in holland now over three years .
and if possible , i will find some of the strange amongst you .
i know it was the reason of the sea .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
i studied women , and she was in breathless .
and all the time , i got more and more knowledge .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 , if a 300-fold .
in 2010 , we had just connected under two billion people online .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
and the lighting away from the rest of the book .
&quot; because she &apos;s been holding her tomorrow , &quot; he said .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropy .
this approach is true for everything new , what we &apos;re doing creative .
since that time , we &apos;ve all been getting all kinds of recognition .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody in this audience .
well , you &apos;re not going to become happier of yourself .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
here &apos;s a picture of an orange in kentucky .
he &apos;s got a bureaucracy of 15 .
i can say the canary is a man .
we &apos;ve been moving into the so-called avian age .
this is equivalent to 20 seafood , like greenland .
this is the audience that we just finished recently .
somewhere here are a series of photographs of photographs -- here they are .
but if you can , if you &apos;re in a foreign distance .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t seem to be more human .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
or do you want to be more powerful , more power , more power .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though that &apos;s heard .
my great-grandparents died as they were 60 .
now , where are we going to go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
so this is kind of like the mosquito stage .
and of course , it can never give it to germany . &quot;
one government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
and the more i spoke , the more i should tell you .
and i celebrate , i cry like a little kid .
obviously , that &apos;s not going to fit everything into my tiny suitcase .
if you &apos;re happy , you attract other happy people .
players are masters in the spiders of social nets .
how can we translate these feelings from the reality ?
that &apos;s how the same , bad team of a best .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worried .
so people in the west were really thinking about creativity for a long time .
b has those benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
one of the things that the telephone was never broken .
we can predict the structure of his behavior , and predict .
a couple of months ago , and i had just forgotten everything .
even who kills someone is not just a furniture .
the invention of the language , for example , was a smaller step in this direction .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
and this video was actually already finished in january .
each of these topics was , of course , a lot of smaller decisions .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing time .
today , i want to tell you about circles and openings .
they &apos;re clearly interacting with their environment and their experiences .
this trick can lead to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
you know , there was no mandarin in in in the paradise .
yes , i &apos;m very happy to be with you .
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is the vision of vision .
i apologize that i have to be so strong .
secondly , what economists call oppression .
and i think it &apos;s worried that the world looks like this .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
so it has nothing changed , and yet everything has changed .
we just crossed the 7-billion-dollar brand .
then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
so , if you ask the lights back up again .
it was a store called draeger .
are you so far ? you see a little bit nervous .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
the things that are used only are used in technical systems .
so the device that you see is not working .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
they did that by taking the country off .
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
welcome the fear of welcome . welcome the risk .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
there &apos;s just the second best , the firefighters .
they can throw away where they go and stand .
an amazing lack of error . one out of nine innocent .
i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually going to end up with a wheelchairman .
this is somebody who hits the rest of the six .
we used to be used to doing things about linear .
i had a 14-year-old boy , poor young mandela .
they &apos;re in the middle , they want to go to the end of the gangs .
and then people could eat the food and not be blind .
because that &apos;s where ownership is going to happen .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what do you feed it ? &quot;
and then we started to negotiate with insulation .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
i &apos;m explaining what these sounds might mean .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re helping , ask people for people .
but also our perception itself , as disappointed them , because we are .
and other examples are the ambitious , intelligent systems .
how many doors have the house that they live in ?
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells good .
i think and i have the feeling that we should teach that .
and i estimate that many of you have done that too .
some people were disappointed that there was no poetry .
i sent them home without talking to my doctor .
the cost of solar is in the last year by 50 percent .
we need to get into the machine of the government .
there &apos;s a direct return for this to be a direct back of namese .
the monkey of software takes a couple of years to do .
and sure enough , we can find fastest chains .
cats look at cats looking at this video .
well , where would you put your brain on that scale ?
and what happened was that i needed a experts .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned language .
i just wish i could see my kids growing up .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
it &apos;s got moments of life , one after the other .
and i remained them to fund an expedition .
we &apos;re talking about the flow of information flow .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineer .
that &apos;s the first year in the first half of its advertising .
well , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
so they move around and make art installations like this .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
i was shocked , and i was crashed into the inside .
i went through the emergency room at my home .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re a special thing . &quot;
i say that because i believe that identity is very important .
because all these new technologies of themselves are eating themselves .
because their lives depended on whether they did the job right .
and these people know what we lost from the eyes .
i knew she had come to be approved .
today , we don &apos;t just find gene , we do it .
a typical wal-mart offers them 100,000 products today .
do you know how many decisions you &apos;re making in a typical week ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical page says .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is what truly amazing .
for example , the previous example was about finding individual units .
he said he didn &apos;t . he will ask .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
if they don &apos;t move more , you have to dig them .
wouldn &apos;t you want to do this change in your genes ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
again , what potential do we want to call down ?
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own episode .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
if we looked at how feelings are related to income .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
there were no christmas trees . we did it all .
and that &apos;s not what we should do . our healthcare system is mimic .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
the words , as long as his friends , mount his .
and what we found was that there was actually a relationship .
do you know how many decisions you make on a typical day ?
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
so the driving force behind this is the cyber power .
i didn &apos;t catch myself for two years with my wife .
the pilot gave the machine to the hudson river .
the epiphany is , death is part of life .
that keeps us in the distance , and makes us more and more evolve .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
it rains about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
you see the person who &apos;s wondering what &apos;s going on in the inner place .
most of my activities , i have two hips on it .
it turns out that dna synthesization is very difficult .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we think about our future as predictable memories .
well , the memory itself is a storyteller .
what it was ruining was the memories of the experience .
we &apos;re going to see ourselves in the next few days .
there &apos;s a step-by-step advance there .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
a fish up , but also a bird reserve .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love story .
this first one was more like a passionate monkey monkey .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he disappointed them .
because the music is a language , and it &apos;s a language to communicate .
and most of all , first of all , is to ask what the right thing is .
but i &apos;m just going to make it a little bit more curious .
i started thinking , i should just remind the project .
so , of course , we can look at the waste problem .
and i don &apos;t really mean a technical definition of the platform .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take you away .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
just to precise scores , they agree .
if the museum gave us the picture , you click on it .
so you can ask : how happy is that living self ?
most of you are completely ignored by the memory of the self .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
has a single one in the audience ever seen somebody die of masses ?
it &apos;s the question of whether you can get that to zero .
you might like to test it to my talk in your immune system .
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum , of a lot of ideas .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
so that , in every store , you can get things back .
so the question is , how do we deal with these windmills ?
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
so , for example , shrimp the environment , less car .
and life lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
so if i put them together side by the way , the interest is you care .
does i look like i could write a song like this ?
she said it would be like a donnous train in the air .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
they add a blue to a green , and they can make light .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast .
yet we &apos;re still on the galapagos islands .
more and more people came in , because they were angry .
it was fear of terror that shaped your life .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
we have a lot of cells that are not alone on themselves .
you make the mistake now , and you pay it very much later .
and what &apos;s below is what we call bureaucracy .
but where would the next aed to help this patient ?
they have to make 62 different decisions to design their car completely .
well , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just that simple .
almost as if we were preparing our lives for our lives .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego space .
i was the only one who could talk to the airport .
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
think of this as a point , as a flying point .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going to do .
this is going to affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
we found that in terms of happiness , of living ourselves .
they evaluate their urine . they almost never do .
usually most people are starting to guide themselves to the task .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
and interestingly , bono is a ted prize .
when you walk , everyone destroys footprint on the ground .
if we overdo it , we can go back a little bit .
the most powerful miner is the head of massey .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a e-book .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will be worse .
and the motive of online criminals are very easy to understand .
because through marine protective areas , we &apos;re basically putting the past .
i want to end with a story that really excited me .
sometimes i lift the balance . a story to conclude .
i found that technology could make magic possible and not kill .
so we &apos;ve now distracted the time-scale .
so today , evolution can happen in the time of microseconds .
here , he lifts a rare tapestry .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
we could reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i &apos;m probably not going to be able to take all of you on this journey .
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
automatically color , outside of the car -- i have 56 opportunities .
they &apos;re not even coming out of the museums .
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
i really like your kind of , sergey brin . now .
i became a part of the miracle that day , not to die .
it &apos;s called eyeri , and you can see the description .
this is the average size of a greenland ice sheet .
i mean , what does somebody do with so many outfits ?
and in general , we can use the word &quot; sexual sexuality . &quot;
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
we all have to believe in the past things that we can &apos;t see .
let &apos;s call him the guel . in fact , he &apos;s called miguel .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to do .
and then the same thing happens in a good conversation .
i have to tell you , i think this was a big mistake .
we &apos;re taking pictures of these mini-bills in the detectors .
economists call this a partisan improvement .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
the way to maximize is to maximize .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
this is a whole book , an example of non-imaging data .
and of course , we all share the same adaptation .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening in the fin of the fbi .
there are accidents that we are , like the owner .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
innovation , creativity , and development not only come out of our heads .
i want to help you a very particular aspect of curiosity .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
ceos is something about average , but this is going to be interesting .
because even though he &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
here &apos;s one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
this deputy of deputy to the older black .
i don &apos;t know how empirical people are going to be .
you &apos;re about the block , and you take it as an openness .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back into the tempt room .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees of our nearest living .
the first of these drops is a contradiction , complexity .
they invest a lot of their time in the construction of the growing structures .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little it &apos;s supported .
usually you &apos;re just dancing and some people don &apos;t get there .
now he mentioned the mineral needs of physical lankton .
i &apos;m going to take the audiences of the audience , consciously or unaware .
you feel that &apos;s the actual truth behind the origins .
but the question i want to throw up is : why not ?
and the best part of this is probably what we expect in health .
this is technology support innovation that &apos;s available today .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so difficult , so painful .
wr want to help people who were convicted .
and that means free , that means open and productive .
how did he get to look for this particular kind of help ?
let &apos;s jump quickly to moma , back to new york .
it &apos;s going to be part of the show , which is pretty abused .
we &apos;re producing androgen , and we &apos;re talking about androids .
and if you do it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this is scandalous , and we should be ashamed .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple practice .
but while they talked to different people around the world about these possibilities .
the ones today have a renewable energy of five percent .
and they &apos;ve done this with so-called lead-map maps .
but crucial is when i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so i &apos;ve been busy doing what is , of course , or intuitive .
and these are just the biohacker , the individual people .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to scientific achievement .
this struck me when i wanted to share my jeans .
he invited the king from the dinner to dinner .
but somehow , we get away from this problem .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last year .
but instead of getting into panic , it just stopped .
how about tears that we can &apos;t even predict ?
if you look at the people who have you to do it ...
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
imagine that every single person is controlled by people .
okay , let me cut a little bit of blood for you .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
new investments to create good jobs .
six : social diarrhea . seven : 65 deaths .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with me like this .
that means that the player safely four of 10 beats .
a long time ago , there were gray whales there -- 500 years ago .
in many , you &apos;re going to say , these are crazy ! that &apos;s good .
the x interpretation interpretation of a piece is this comparable .
from my eye view , i saw the master and go down .
light bulbs in a glass of glass , i always found very exciting .
so this picture , for example , has about 10 billion points , i think .
so i decided that when i was 15 , i was going to be a dive .
i &apos;m going to get a little bigger here . we &apos;re going to look right here at the center .
and within less years , lego moved to every household .
the judge is looking at him as adults , but i see a child .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer , by the way .
and i &apos;d like to show you my outlet for this week .
56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t come out of court .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-esteady .
i asked him how to become such a fish experts .
there was the nuclear research facility odharbor .
from that time , a anecdote that you may know .
no longer need to whip a lovely , or sing .
and six milliseconds , even a very exciting phenomenon .
this is going on much further back into the cultures of industrial times .
so , i think it &apos;s a very unfair hack .
i think it &apos;s kind of like a sixth of a dollar or something like that .
that actually has only two thousand really , really thought that this networks .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
so , this looks like a basketball plate .
and if we can do that , can we launch the chromosome ?
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i didn &apos;t let myself down .
well , in fact , the number of violence has not changed very much .
i first eaten him in a restaurant in southern spain .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
it was always so inspiring , so refugee .
the death penalty in america is defined by irritum .
flip the trunk on the side . go home .
just this airport has a surface of 100 squares .
i like things that are special . i like special things .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
so maybe you should be asking the interview a little bit about this . &quot;
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machinery .
here you see an excerpt from this attack of attack .
we &apos;ve got his bed to see it outside .
we degraded a man who has value for our society .
we &apos;re putting games to get to the real world .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take this . why not ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : they are .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
this is actually the true gear of human and machine .
a couple of things . probably about as many creative people here .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
they produced the highest constructions in the least time .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons for every planet .
i grew up with a policey science fiction .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building sively , not intense .
so this was finally a company that was trying to do it right .
the component is getting more and more for the friend that you live together .
and i &apos;m not sure you &apos;re really going to stay out .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little trip .
there was , in my opinion , a very good code .
in fact , nasa showed that there are many of them out there .
they like to increase the paralysis and the satisfaction .
well , i wondered how can i really get this up ?
it &apos;s an independent area . they all control minerals .
in contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view of the world .
someone was broken , and the system had fooled the system .
photos like this : a lot of bike along the road .
the biggest fear was empowered , raped and death .
so it turns out it &apos;s very hard to figure out all these extensions .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange road .
but this time , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
i &apos;ve taught seven underwear , and that &apos;s all .
but a lot of people get caught in a very strange position .
our gut is a wonderful friendly friendly environment for these bacteria .
well , the two species of the self throw two terms from happiness .
well , the living self lives on its own life continually .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness .
it &apos;s just a bold calories . it &apos;s mimics .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
ah , the majority . i like to see that as a doctor .
my inspiration comes from a event that is 2,500 years ago .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
now , what does that have to do with placebo effect ?
the smallpox . the pox had killed billions of people on this planet .
it &apos;s the renewable energy that they &apos;re often called .
this is a fish up in the soul of western spain .
since i ask , how professionally competent was that diagnosis ?
the notized notes have the function of a letter .
then these are the allies of the pre-industrial cultures .
that means you &apos;re navigating about sound and rhythm .
so this is just a use of a lot you can do with it .
and then we &apos;ve done this kind of cooperation , which is how it works .
on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to lhc .
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
this is what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
54 percent of the deaths were cut through drill .
in essence , the concrete stone had become our time .
how about a new sentence , never before , hearing voices before .
how can a judge someone in something that he &apos;s not ?
in many areas , people had to be scared of lynch .
so programs that can care about the most numerous nucleus .
for example , the fish was taken on a glory .
opportunities that had not been allowed to have been expressed .
so i made a couple of years ago to do that .
finally , when we &apos;re suggesting that we should welcome the fear .
it was an eight-handed . how is your brand ?
why is it important to start again ? what &apos;s the red ?
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free of limitations .
and i said , &quot; how are you communicating ? &quot;
well , in this night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
and the key indigenous indicator is the extinction of languages .
and i had to explain to the journalists that there &apos;s not that test .
and this is called androgenic receptor defects .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative , heart .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a ph.d .
at the moment , they are in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
and soon , i wrote an article about technology changed food .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
so i offered a 100,000 dollars on software for the winner .
one day , this mirror , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
there was no piano at the time when i was in the instrument .
you learn to find the sounds in the instrument .
even if you were to shoot themselves , you would have emissions .
most of the people know this from the software industry .
this is actually live in the internet . you can check it out .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nunapologetic .
but nothing was invented , that would leave me again until now .
and the best part of it is that they connect together with magnets .
some of my klghts happened in the last five years .
i looked into the raw , and it was a little bit pink .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular tonight .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
so the dramatic numbers come from the prisoners .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about the death penalty .
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know a lot about government , when i started this program .
this is my whale wash . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
what is the context of thinking and feeling about them ?
and when the endangered , things can happen really bad things .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
they talk about nature &apos;s power to tell us who we are .
if we actually don &apos;t take phosphorus and give it off .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most magical thing for me .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours per minute are uploaded .
if they were able to do it , they could help me .
and they just disappeared all these companies , one after the other .
i &apos;m sad that we never know each other as adults .
remember , it &apos;s free , nobody deserves us from it .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
and that &apos;s why , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
so in our culture , we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism .
he said , &quot; zos , you have to go to the house .
if you could only one of them , it would be a very different world .
specialized skills and processing skills and their combination .
people here have contributed to the development of these miracles .
and somehow , we have to make changes that are located on zero .
we &apos;re still finding other strings of what their rights are .
this is the period of most perceptions that we have .
this is our youngest tester down there .
by the end of march , the lhc again will be functional .
and that &apos;s the message that i took in medical school .
you know how to call a 3,000-pound league baseball ?
i think in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
when someone gets lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
and so i think the ted community should be horse .
and she &apos;s spread , of course , organic , organic .
my friends from honduras asked me to say , thank you ted .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
well , after all , the film has a very large doubt .
this is actually only a period of two to two or two weeks .
these people are going to be connected to the movie forever -- forever .
so all of these green areas , these are the targeted environments .
one is called jazz , and the other is called &quot; sweeping . &quot;
so unfortunately , we have a piece of god &apos;s play a long way to virtual .
i went to the car and was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
in the short time here , i became clear : ted has an identity .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good percentage of intuition to actually extend the experiments .
in my opinion , mass tiles have changed our world .
this is all reality today , and it &apos;s going to be much more possible in the future .
so this allows the interaction to grow up from binds , trust and each other .
here &apos;s what it says , the more you care , the better .
people said , do you don &apos;t have fear , never succeed ?
i don &apos;t know what they think of me , but i can live with it .
and what i learned is that errors are absolutely undesperate .
i love this : &quot; watson makes human enemies . &quot;
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very serious .
three months later , i moved around , and the adventure went on .
it &apos;s about creating scarce goods around the river .
i like a lot of black colors , lots of grams and stuff like this .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony with tony .
this is what we want to use as a potential pulse for the flyaches .
and the question was : how could you connect technology to this ?
for example , i don &apos;t want to give you the same fish as a human being .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast .
i was playing the first sentence of beethoven concert .
the man is supposed to have a monkey or a common ancestry .
according to the show and the show , and b , etc .
how were his living conditions , how the society and politics ?
on september 10th , september last year , the machine was running for the first time .
we &apos;ve distributed livian children to be distributed to play with it .
and when i heard her , she was making kelihood of sounds .
and i was good , i went out with claude .
but if i ask you , how are you going to be with your wife ?
you &apos;re collecting information about the piece of sekh literature .
there are a lot of people working there , and they can all be engaged .
but how would it be if the image you linked to all your images ?
you say you &apos;re not going to forget the names of dying .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other regional technology .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
we should be able to be able to rotate anything we want .
and i tend to see wises as my shadow .
so , in a way , studies have been done to see if that was true .
you can see that there &apos;s an enormous amount of opportunity there .
the natural forces come from asia , in japan , from japan .
because a good engineer either has either great cars or nuclear power plants .
and that was the very first start of a musical expression .
you can only have zeros , if you &apos;re not there .
it &apos;s fine . the question is , how will we go .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
the official faith of all western industrialized societies .
&quot; do you remember the patients they ran home ? &quot;
we live on a planet that covers 70 percent with water .
they just dive the construction of apartments against the cities .
because that &apos;s how you can use that logic just wrong .
often , the music class is that you &apos;re only learning the notes .
and that would be just the letters that you learned to paint .
eight : tsunamization . 9 speakers : cyberattacks
i wanted us to do a long and healthy life .
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
now , if it &apos;s hardly accessible , maybe the most necessary thing is necessary .

he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is how often this has been mentioned so many times .
this can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .
when you turn on the light , it looks like this . so just as we saw it before .
imagine the screen could just appear in different formats or size , in different solutions .
so i started to think what it is , in what these games are doing .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to get to the needle .
and what the marshmalware does is it helps you to identify hidden assumptions .
they &apos;re doing it because they &apos;re able to follow the white line of the land road to 92 .
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re kind of moved to nostalgia , you know , cry .
and what we can read almost every day in the daytime newspaper is that you find in this third sentence .
one example is from a very different area . monet has painted the erox times .
and i want to give you a protocol that i was here for my part of the jobs here .
that was our first attempt to start with the digital information , of the genomphi x 174 .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique track case , the rhythm of the tangible in any culture .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is change the order of history in which this information is represented .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true that less is .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera would mean that we wanted to do a backward conversation .
so , for example , the number 164 is very sticking out of this code ; you can &apos;t see it .
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
if these imagery fall down , you can write them , you can write patterns , images , text .

or are we going to be able to do something else -- something that might even be better adapted to the environment ?
i really hope that we play meaningful games to survive on this planet another century .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing , age and soul itself to afford to afford it .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same ratio to progress as we used to .
the idea here is obviously not just the machine control over the control room .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- really made me out of the socks .
these gray boxes don &apos;t walk with windows ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .

as a kid , i had collected collections of sticks , a box , kick and mud .
and so , from the interest of this technology , on this technology , i &apos;m just going to go on there .
so , for example , we developed an ice package that &apos;s in space temperature .
unfortunately , not in open bach , but maybe you can help the france a little bit .
in high school , a student once said that brian man would learn a bloody man for a flower .
i &apos;m going to include a statistic that i hope most of you have heard about .

if someone would ask you to describe your brand identity , your brand of personality , how would you be ?
so basically , what i &apos;m going to do is , if you look at something that &apos;s impossible , it &apos;s possible to do it .
because the lesson that i &apos;m trying to learn myself this week is that it &apos;s okay to let it go .
and maybe we know that we &apos;re from what wood that we &apos;re designed when we &apos;re really examined .
a third sentence that immediately appeared to people who have a strong sense of a soul .
it &apos;s called the ancient law , or whatever psychology that affects us , again , in the perception of perception .

we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
i can accelerate the whole sequence by turning the speed into one or another .
this question was so tangible that we decided to go to research and build foundations .
we say , &quot; computer , we &apos;re going to have a hundred million randomly selective sequences of instructions .
do the methods that are easy to use and start using these patients in the team .
and i think the most important point is that we &apos;ve stopped talking to our patients .
so maybe we sell a shoe , and he &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe that they &apos;ve ever contributed ...
why not have the fast muscle fibers that will allow you to be faster and faster ?
we know that we work as human beings , when we get hard , significant work .
we know from that study that study that you have to reach the needle when it &apos;s supposed to go .
i gave them an example of the north american tribe of nooty india .
maybe a aging understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative .
we now have an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century , so we can predict the development .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privileged privileged , silly conferences .
so we could just end up with the world very simple with stupid , maybe even hundreds of new cities of cities .
when i went back 27 years later , the fish went down to half the size of his size .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , this is exactly what happened to the $ 77100 ?
it &apos;s almost impossible to be bad to be bad , if you wear red pants .
do we use these decisions to form a society that &apos;s better , the successful is the friendship ?
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change your cells ?
this also represents the conversational value of this talk , so i hope it &apos;s got hatred to you .
but in fact , my research institute at the future is the opposite , is exactly the opposite .
there &apos;s nothing going to go to my physicist or get out , no trickles , and they can study everything .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics that made me crazy at all had no fanatics .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often as &quot; walking wave . &quot;
i remember last year when i brought mosquitos and somehow the people liked it .

you don &apos;t sit around and flip around and around . there &apos;s always a very important thing to do .
our memory tells us stories that means what we need to keep in our experience is a story .
tell you that there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that move different things ?
this is basically the deadline that shows us the environmental models that we need to hold .
and also the ones -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need any fuel -- they have some parts .
i &apos;m sure they &apos;re not going to be both . they &apos;re not even going to leave the glass .

she heard about this book of charles darwin , the emergence of the species and the desk of man .
i honored my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , oma , i &apos;m going to do this . &quot;
evolution is all about the gift of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival for generation .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my physiology therapy .
now , if i had opened the present-day gear with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
the people in their faith in their faith , and that &apos;s the fact that you can &apos;t free them .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design workshop .
there &apos;s a fluid reactor that seems something hard , but maybe saying that about us .
here we see this again , again , again , the el again , the whole , single greaggregate .
overview : now , i can sort of interacting with the object , again , zoom in , zoom in .
sounds very first time banal , but it &apos;s relaxing if you &apos;re closer to it .
because a lot of the time , people can &apos;t make it friendly , so everyone can deal with it .
this is a game with words that is a kind of a mixture of rabbit and boxes .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace it , it will be a huge challenge .
if you break the goldfish glass , it &apos;s all possible , it &apos;s the satisfaction .
if i put in a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think about me .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to the court and wear this crazy case .

so we &apos;re overwhelming our brains , because our brain just doesn &apos;t realize it really makes sense .
i received another gift , which is to look back into the future , and come back and live differently .
that means we have a common ancestor , a evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
so we have the memory itself and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
unfortunately , it &apos;s all the good news , because there are a few other problems , and they &apos;re often mentioned .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much on our energy without changing its lifestyle .
but the ocean , the real ocean , i got only two years later when we moved to california .
so you need to follow the learning process of music , at least as long as the spoken language of language .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put together these little pieces of pieces , and the mistakes could correct .
we &apos;ve managed to put it on about a hundred genes from the 500 or something like this .
and this really strips these ideas to create these limitations for the visible place on the screen .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species may have been around for 600,000 years .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us do .
we developed an app for layar , augmented reality to find these aeds .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , i &apos;m going to tell you about a knee that works on the gym .
we use this great euphemism , try and error , which turns out to be meaningful .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning .

the founding fathers were from my view of the original atomic activists , and that &apos;s why .
they were playing a rut game , and the seals were allowed to break down a epic adventure .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , that &apos;s success of scientific method .
it would have been without the global demand , but the power is so much more important .
certainly , i would never do an alien world with a spacecraft , which seemed quite unlikely .
we &apos;re not going to answer it immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
well , just to conclude , i want to realize that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
who knows when the film comes out , we might look like a horror volcanoe .
what are we going to do with the fact that we &apos;re just going to distinguish by a few nucleotides ?
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then raise my strength and remove it .
but if you &apos;re in a episode , and you &apos;re told , &quot; we &apos;re going to do the oil . &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have never been there before , there would be human potential for the potential .
and that &apos;s going to get worse , and pretty soon kids will die , because that &apos;s just one of the numbers .
in the rich world , the millions of us have been threatened by just a generation , hardly .
here &apos;s a very fundamental service . is there too much lights at home so you can read the homework ?
the greeks called these divine strength of creativity of creativity .
and i find it dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see you going to go to the next century .
and we &apos;re installing an evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going on in the microseas .
so in other words , the future is around a year for each year , i &apos;ve been around the world .
they shoot the decision -- shoot at them , even when it comes to their own self-interest .
so these things are -- you know , they &apos;re reminding people -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
if you surround yourself with the right people , you won &apos;t just understand it , you will also appreciate it .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said they were doing this model right .
one way , which is particularly interesting , and which i used in the last time is the evolution itself .
we had a team of rocks in boston in boston last year to program for code .
so imagine you would be at the same time , how would that feel ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
so the neurons are the source of the information processing , which have built these cell communities .
so , it was possible to connect the little digital head head with the rotax control .
eaceaca , a small antioxidancer that helps you to do that .
no , the gap i &apos;m talking about , which has to do with it , that they fake themselves .
when professors become curious , they &apos;re often pushed into this kind of research on top of the ocean .
this happened to be machine age , and this is what happens to the book , and the story is the photogray gray .
and it &apos;s about working on a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and we think that we &apos;re going to be the first to be the vibrated generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .

and the main lesson that we think i &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
but there &apos;s no promise that we can look at where you learn how to make fire .
being anxious to write the piece , will always be more and more to play my personal anxiety , to play .
but that concepts of the cyberage that bring us back to discover these possibilities back to discover our skills .
so this naught has to survive longer , and they have a vast majority of servant in size .
that &apos;s how simple words that we use in the language of politically correctly .
the first example is ahead of what many of you know and some of you estimate , few of them don &apos;t need at all .
instead , they go to the doctor , and the doctor says to them : we could do a a or we could do b .
i want to talk to you about this mechanism today something or something , which is probably unfamiliar to you .
so now , i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite images , harvesting orbital drivers in the wild .
but now , when you get the evidence , you have to take that evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
for example , in openness , for example , the trunk of the trunk are 20 percent of the trunk between windmills .
but again and again , very rare , something special happened . one of the performers was actually overwhelmed .
my heart rustles , i was swallowed , while i was trying to capture what was going on .
the human part of this book , the end , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
immediately , they become one for those of us who have predicted this , which you can &apos;t prove .
they &apos;ve reformed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever made .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that will be changed much of biology .
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to take away from your mind . how can you be harnessed ?
for these non-engineers , lifted glaciers became another material , electronics was just another material .
so what can you do three billion , healthy , productive members of the community ?
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is indian , but it &apos;s also very time-consuming .
and every time it divided , the findings in it will distribute chemicals in the same way .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow , to achieve a realistic outcome .
so i wanted to create something different , something that begins in the process when the eradication is wiped out .
and when you pick up a picture with a camera that ends up when you put it on the ground .
yet , my interest in photography , when i received my first digital camera , at age 15 .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , these black object that you see .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break down into 20 parts of how you know it from documentaries .
i spent a lot of time in my life trying to be myself , to be myself and to adapt at the same time .
but not only that -- they merge and connect them with the universe and other devices out there .
three billion hours per week are not nearly enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world .
there &apos;s such a strike of things like this all kinds of genetic plants on the branches .
if anyone who would have built a 2.50-inch construction , he would have contributed the price at home .
i met mr in the 2008 in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney hall .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far you can take a piece of future away .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus , who really had to go back to circles .
the result is that i don &apos;t get anywhere i &apos;m treated , i &apos;m going to be interrupted .
they can go and create their own museum online -- from all these pictures , they can assemble their own collections .
so , in the great and all of this , we &apos;re very confident that we &apos;ve actually determined what the goal is .
well , an epiphany is usually something that you find because you dropped it somewhere .
so the idea is that we actually bring people together with things that they do together , collective .

because the ground is going to die off the moose and the wind and the water is washing the ground .
so that you &apos;re just going to be able to deploy as citizens that are dedicated to these scientific technologies .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you see in the same way .
this is one of the images that we &apos;ve seen with the so-called gapx technology .
well , since the film was on the sundance film festival , we can look at this time .
and every time i interview somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
pollinators are born as calving a limb or break them out of ice .
so in this project , we actually designed some little marker to follow the garbage while the system goes through the system .
our language is based on the social changes that have been solved in many cases by a technological change .
but danny , in the entire american quest , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
i know that we can , and as far as it is , it &apos;s something that needs the world now .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccinations for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , very much -- but let &apos;s see how different teams are changing the teams .
and , although it really seems simple , it &apos;s really hard to work , because it &apos;s very fast to people .
there are very , very few things that you can even say , of which there &apos;s a chance in a million .
and i noticed how much these deep-sea pets , a space mission like this .
that was the movement . it was the law . it was the business plan of the american agriculture .
so when i come with my little sow pioneel and i just think this feeling comes up .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
we made little pieces , we made a miserable correction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
and they found an article with false thought , they could feel the creator of this thought .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the stream , as nobody could have predicted .
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , oma . i promise it . &quot;

and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is going to be quantum mechanical , we had to send the whole bunch of stuff out .
we want to be good for the society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , isn &apos;t it the highest , right ?
we &apos;ve been digitized to almost 20 years . when we sequenced the human-humanizing genome , the change of the analog world of biology into the digital world .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of pills if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of your cheese is one of them .
so , in order to buy new jeans after many years of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
in order to give a sense of this sensor , i had to think of something of this remarkable faith of doun and voodoo is not a cult of black magic .
and because there &apos;s nothing more important than our survival , the first place for all the information that is a part of our temporal lobe , the amydala .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i got most of the feedback , or where i had the greatest success , these are where i interacting with things directly .
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend a lot of time trying to imagine the kind of stuff , because if you think about the whole time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
you have to separate two things : to be a medical fact , to be amputated , and to be the social opinion of whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
the basic idea of this company was to overcome the analog processes with optical prints , and start to start with digital production .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to put the data on a usb -- how we &apos;ve seen it at stuxnet .
and in that way , time is actually the critical variability that has a memorial of self from a living self , has very little impact on this story .
and it works in a medical culture that recognizes people to fill the system with life , and if that &apos;s how to make people mistake also time .
and it will allow people to be able to measure their blood pressure , send it to their doctor and share it with others , for more than 100 dollars .
so the first case is , all the zones of atoms are made out of the metal and there are all over the same time moving the same atoms and down the same atoms .
when i think about creating flow , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibilities .
but recently , dna evidence shows that the etrusman , later the roman empire , the same dna as the old lyrics .
how do you increase happiness is very different from how you think and whether you think of the memory of yourself , or whether you think of the living self .
but if you &apos;ve got very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a mammals -- they &apos;re digging out -- they &apos;re bumps without all the complex qualities .
we &apos;re going to turn it on , and expect to collect the first data in june or july , and put our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
we want to create the world of creation , the inventor , the most encouraging , because this world in which we live , these interactive world .
imagine this device in the middle of a developing country , where there &apos;s no doctors , but 25 percent of the load and 1.3 percent of the health care workers .
so one day , i decided to go to visit the filiters , and i asked the head of this model , &quot; this model works that they provide all these people ? &quot;
the head of congress came up to the stage and said , &quot; professor romer , i thank you for your talk , but we might look at the tedtalk .
we need to lead those conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time machine and go into the future , we &apos;ll be happy to do that .
so i got back with a little team on the unknown terrain , and we went , &quot; avatar , &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
and then we &apos;re not compassionate , but that &apos;s true , i think , has already been through a good thing that people are quite convinced .
i mean , it can be strange to think that a thing at the same time is two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they developed them .
and sometimes a small prototype of all this experience , which takes us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; -- to bring a ta-tail-point moment .
but the lateyed was very beautiful , and the people in my company told me that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do it .
i was seventh , when i went back to one of his classes and played the last of the four balkans of chopin , a nightmare .
when your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at everything for you . everybody knew you had this physical rehabilitation that you helped you .
in nine people that we have executed , one that we have been dedicated to innocent , who has been depleted and made out of the death cell .
so an organism could learn for example , a certain fruit didn &apos;t eat , because it buried bad and made it sick , the last time it ate her .
personally , i &apos;m going to find out that it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to come up with a compromise with the ideas in his head .
it &apos;s about how you meet people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and make them a satisfying experience .
finally , this older black man came out with a very concerned face in the court , and they sat behind me , almost on the defense bank .
there it is , this plane is made up of hundreds of thousands of small parts of which work together to make their safer . isn &apos;t that satisfied ? &quot;
one day -- this is a actual report -- this came in , &quot; advice in my garbage . can &apos;t say if she &apos;s dead .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults who wanted to know me was going to relaxed in a box of kiaks , and was put in my hands .
we &apos;re going to have a process that could possibly take 100,000 years from now , and we can compress it on a thousand years -- and maybe even at the next 100 years .
there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-uh-oh moments than others , and under the worst chief are frozen .
this is what we &apos;re looking at before we see it , then we &apos;re looking back to the back of our device in the backyard to say , okay , okay .
his job is to create conditions that existed less than a billionth of the universe at the beginning of the universe -- and to 600 million times a second in a second .
but they also preserve a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to more challenges , through creativity and more creativity and print .
and many discussions that i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had in the last three years to photovoltaics .
a saint of pencil , if you make the power full of water , it has enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s four to six to six to six sideways .
and something interesting happened to me , which was to me in jacques cousteau , which was the idea of a totally unknown world here on our earth .
and our european compound is basically just out of louder rotators of large power plants , wherever the wave is around europe is all about europe .
one process that &apos;s going to be -- like everybody knows who has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , in fact , everyone here -- not always being reasonably accessible .
and every year we ask the students to create products , products , services and services , which are within a decade can live in a positive life of human beings .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think a lot of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far apart , but that it &apos;s increased .
and finally , saturday : a unique , personal style , personal style is a great way to tell the world something about a word without having to say a word .
they didn &apos;t count because he was with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had to keep .
i think the molecular biology in general is now talking very general , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
how would it be that the oppressed , wherever you are , to give a voice to focus on change and make change , for the first time ?
i love to find any opportunity to find a different colorful , crazy outcomes , closely , to wear , and to photograph in the last time and to blogger .
i used to tell my wife , whenever a human in a moral juvenile action , because we should use it to replace it through the dictionaries .
and it turns out that when you make it a little bit more concrete , it feels a very good tool to save people to save more .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people we love to preserve salad salaries , but also preferred to get good with it .
so we take something very complicated , we turn it into sound , a sequence of sounds , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
no , it just looks a lot better if we show that we &apos;re always involved in getting rid of the dangers that create others , if they just lay fire fire .
now , in egypt , egypt plotted the rise in april of the main source of the egyptian secretary police , and they found a lot of actors .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of programming , zero coverage , constitutional parties and trains , tony recorded to the first seven times after seven years .
so this is what these reactors were a problem that we &apos;re going to fill in our stomach and reducing the waste dramatically during that process .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to create the digital code in a new phase of biology , by designing new biology and building new life .
but this is what keeps me at night -- one of the things that i &apos;m standing at night . we &apos;ve never been doing so much progress as i &apos;ve never had before .
according to burra , the premium premium was in january , and since then -- this is not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million calls from this film .
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate at the moment , from the coal power plants , because we don &apos;t have any other way , or gag , because that &apos;s not what &apos;s going on .
a lot of our friends thought we were pretty stupid to do that , and we all came back to the walls and all the images were on the walls of the graffiti .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst error in the first five years was passive , which is a lot of my colleagues , but total nonsense .
but these apps are like small digital memory memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government who are paying taxes and services .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very exclusive song at least ; at least he was really exclusive .
in a country that has just been a hemispheric crisis , in which congress has been elected to this congress with 124 / 7 voice .
it seems like we &apos;re right from the other parts of life , but in fact , the biggest part is the fundamental mechanisms that our cells are pretty much the same .
but the logic of deception allows us to do it as if the first sentence of prevention was wrong , as if you had to take advantage of the opposite of it .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert when i &apos;m going to have the experience that i &apos;ve been working on so long as i &apos;ve been working on a long time , how new to experience .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up to my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing , you hear that way . &quot;
well , there are rotates and eight marks , these things that come and walk , but playing an eight-hour marke is a pretty strong thing .
and if you &apos;ve already got the drugs that you get from cox complex , and you &apos;re high-tech , let me tell you : the user data is a science for itself .
if i tell you that somebody &apos;s life has eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self .
well , i started with some people in the company , and nobody could give me an extraordinary answer , until i finally started with the biologists .
basically , you get every round of distortion on each sideways , and while you &apos;re trying to form words , they &apos;re going to be translated over a dictionary .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot more well-being or maybe a little less after i talked to you about it .
but then another one happened , very interesting step , where things were completely different , which started communicating these cells and diving information , so that communities were born from cells .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference , we say , in the climate .
they &apos;re starting out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see is airports and these poems , density .
we have now , from our discoveries from all over the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these design components are the design of the future .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me tremendous trust in our future is the fact that we have more than we have today to give us the great challenges of our planet .
so a app that &apos;s written in a couple of days , and then it &apos;s spread from rare , is a kind of a snapshot of the bug on the government .
what that means is that if you hit somebody , and you would tell them , oh , his father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about his size ?
and at this point , when you laugh , you realize how important this gap is and how much time you need to experience something to experience something that artists can share us very well .
how would it feel to live in a world where the german state has made people , especially if they were insufficient to be a lot of jews .
and because the government finally exposed their power to us -- he remembered you , &quot; is we the people ? &quot; -- how do we think about how this change happens .
are they reliable , stable , stable , affordable , safe , sacred , sacred , considering how the dalai lama or yoda ?
this is ayahuasca , who heard many of you have heard the most powerful psychoactive parties from the repertoire of the shame .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with sexual people whose gender is atypnic -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female physicists .
we all had to do this at the time , when we took a book , we took the description of the exchange and prompted it to the canvas in our minds .
we came up to talk about music . and a few days later , i got an email , which was that nathaniel was interested in education for me .
and since we &apos;re giving ourselves the medieval campus , for example , the virtual reality in our v.r.r. laboratory , we can actually do it all the time .
i said , &quot; well , do you do , you know , and i both know if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because it &apos;s as much sense as everything else that i heard when it was about to explain the absolutely crazy thing to the creative process .
so it &apos;s so far . and for those of you who were not there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever launched -- 27 miles across the diameter .
and i &apos;ve argued that we might be creating a new form of cambrian explosion in which there could be a massive new massive education based on this digital design .
the reason is that it used to be better than anything bad was when everything was worse , it was possible for people to make experience a pleasant surprise .
and i was handled with me that if i doubled my efforts to perfection and never again make a mistake that the voice could reverse .
so these are just a few of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could also be the last six days , or the last six years .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i had several months to plan to plan them to find the different places for the pieces of the piece .
but also , because it turns out that we &apos;re using all the time to actually change what we &apos;re capable of as humans .
i can now have the clear notions that the bach had to get on the modern wing of what a baroo balo can &apos;t do .
already from the german english to translate , more knowledge can be forgotten , once you deny it if you &apos;re concerned about it , or you &apos;re about poetry .
bg : now we need one of these scaling , generalizing things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then spend 20 years to use .
if you play games , you &apos;ll see some nuances here that are zoomed up and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrow shows surprising .
you have to imagine that if you &apos;re going to make something of the classical trajectory , five hours , and you need this new kind of natural software , just an hour .
i &apos;m a wall creature . to work on it , i have to stand up every day at the same time , and i sweat , and i &apos;m really uncomfortable .
so they found out , according to the herotus , the rocks game and agreed a national strategy . one day you &apos;d eat . the next day you would play .
the other note is that we &apos;re using the zero-sum emissions , whether it &apos;s developed in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
the movie studio , i sold this as &quot; romeo and julia ship on a ship , &quot; it was a widespread film , a passionate film .
so far in discussions , it &apos;s always tried to take these insulons that have targeted targets that have a small grid that has nothing to do with our own grid and nothing .
and so we decided to build in berlin into a hall where we can sort of form the electrical agencies in the scale of one in three very precisely .
that means that the interpret has to translate this imperative of the emergency language in another , hearing , vocal , non-concrete , non-verbal language .
it &apos;s intuitive power , not only has apple been a fundamental factor of economic factor , elementary successes when i &apos;m going to use technological devices to make people useless .
a lot of journalists called me on the question , &quot; what are they going to do is they tell us whether caster seti is female or male ? &quot;
well , what i hear is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing that &apos;s wrong .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and bring them together to play a kind of game , to control their health .
and imagine , even as a five-year-old child with dr. p. and so , they &apos;re trying to stop those practices , natural success without success .
bg : well , the actual spending for research -- we should spend the 10 billion dollars a year more than they do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatically .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that lets us explore , and interact , and the unexpected expectations that we form are the real nutrition of creativity .
and there were no video games or these over-generated video filters without the whole language in media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
as you knew in the village at the time , who &apos;s what happened with whom and when that happens today , this extension of our self through these mobile devices on global level .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking the responsibility that i was so concerned and so i could be able to serve my patients without having to contact them .
i got a fine ticket because i &apos;m not going to go to the bike lanes , but often there &apos;s a disability that doesn &apos;t allow you to drive a bike on the road .
and so i think of one of the people , along with most other experimental quantum physics , need a good percentage of logic to add the complex ideas together .
when we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream of a kind of solution .
jacques cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating shows , the animals and places of the world , and a miracle of wonder that we never had before .
and when it comes to us , of course , we &apos;ve done it for nike , for nike and mauritz and all the textile industry .
in each step , we produced these pieces of pieces in the overhead so that we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process of creating them in a minute .
in other words , when the sovereign conversation of the 20th century is the participation of our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or making something new .
my wife , my kids , and i moved to the garage , and these hacker and programmers , and they have taken away from literacy and archives that have taken our house .
we can take a step further , and then remove the data , and see that circles and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
90 percent of the big fish we love , the tuna , the tuna , the hot buts , the chimps , heavy fish , they &apos;re broken together .
over the last 100 years , average life expectancy has doubled more than doubled the average income of the world &apos;s income , has tripled tripled trivial .
one of the areas that we see in the help of beijing , in our culture today , in the united states today , are the fighting over the beginning and the end of life .
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul goes around and talks about vaccines and says how valuable they are , and that the people should just stop there .
the second one is a sense of experience and memory : basically it &apos;s made between his life in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
you go up into these capsules , you float into this dark , hostile environment , where there &apos;s no hope for rescue , if you don &apos;t get it back to yourself .
so , from that point of view , there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only from that absence of posture to the point of view , which is a hundred percent renewable .
it was discovered in the cell , and it recognized the other chromosome as a stranger of the material , and so we just had a single cell with a new chromosome .
and these scientists have just documented the different topics with which these ceo buses , and how much time they spend to make decisions with the issues that are related to the issues .
all of you think that i was &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have been running somewhere on a handshake on the beach .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and i should do it , because these love story , like romantic romantic , is also vital .
my first memories are from this boat -- the stealing of the motors , the sound of each wave on the threshold , the threshold and the far horizon .
and if you manipulate the speed of this novel , you &apos;re actually able to put the rotor into the rotor , and eventually even the centrifuge explode .
it &apos;s the living self that presents the doctor -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; is it going to hurt now when i fiber you here ? &quot;
now , when we go further and we go to age , we say 40 or younger years , we see that even the major tower is about people to worry about .
we should call them what they are , an advertisement , a commercial , a commercial capital that understands very rapidly , that enables these production .
we can investigate whether we can use storage co2 that could be put into production , converted the co2 into the fuel process to drive this process .
so when i started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell them this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
if people would take this fund seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything on their head , everything we believe , for example , in terms of tax policy and so on .
it depends on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s what the opposite of the first sentence is already proven and predicting .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the crew and reuters design -- which we actually had founded the company in the first place -- slowly .
this looks something like this , who has no willingness , can not be pulled for his actions and foundations to be pulled out , and he &apos;s so unable to do .
since i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and that &apos;s why my palette is going to be much more nuances of color , emotions and emotions than they have today .
the ones in such an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , electronics , combined , combining the very vehicle .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat ocean , is so fascinating in life as we can &apos;t really imagine it .
and then the scale of the semantic agents and the shops that are really terrified , and it &apos;s a classic network .
i recently made a question about 25,000 americans , and the average number of decisions , which is a typical american on a day .
a couple of weeks later , the fire gave a letter to the household in which they put themselves on the tapestry of their house .
the food that was delivered from a chef or a chef or a chef , has to be eaten and not only looked at cheating or receptor .
they should prepare these innovations , and they would be smiled by the ridiculous ones that will be trained for these innovative ways .
and if you want to go over 20 percent renewable energy , so energy a year , not the performance at the moment , you have to switch off the el .
and then we ran a v.d burning , burning the burning room , and then tried to focus on this camera on the camera .
of course , the chance of randomness is very small to have a small amount of nucleus , so they &apos;re probably not going to be an instructions of instructions .
that means , instead of reclaiming us , we have standardized standardized , in masses of memories that we can relate to our personal memories .
and yet , the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkable value of clean coal technology that you see here , everything .
so i sent them home , mixed up , i made a quiet voice in me trying to tell me , &quot; goldman , you don &apos;t do a good idea . &quot;
what do you think the average performance of a cardiologist or a nurse or a nursery , a birthday , should be a rescue ?
this is a people who are not cognitively different from the colors of blue and green , because that &apos;s the sky of the forest that depends on people , equally .
and my love to science fiction appeared in my environment , because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea .
we see many , many gigabytes of digital photos here that can move forward and move on as they move forward , can refined in any way in any way .
this tribe , the cohen , 17 variations on ayahuan huasca that you all recognize at the distance of the forest that seem to be a way of looking at our eyes .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , was to present your product as many people as possible , to see so many people as possible .
and in this community , you can see that the most important thing is the idea that you have in front of each other , because you have a task that you can explain .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious to be , at least for those of us who are traveled to this distance of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not removed at all .
that our system has also got a prize , because we &apos;re going to make it 20 percent with oil , and we &apos;re not going to go through the other things .
we only spent two years on phosphorus , and now we &apos;ve been using the phosphorus mountain range of a lot more uranium in the environment than in all atomic facilities .
we promote notions that in 10 years , the decline of civil rights recognition will be as high as the voting of the election of the election .
and there &apos;s a generation that has grown up on the internet , and the knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the right systems .
and as far as the isolation goes , as a species of distant planets , it becomes isolated and change the changes of the environment that could produce natural evolution in a natural way .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to have to have to have a shelter , a leader like a shield or something .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species and converted into a completely new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
well , i hope that you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to live in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
now , please , all of these randomly available instructions , leadership , all kinds of programs , and selecting those who are the ones who are the next one . &quot;
these are two very different units that living self and remembering the memory of self , and the two to both change is different from happiness .
if this device sequences a ringing or dna virus that &apos;s not known , it &apos;s the health agency and preventing a pandemic in front of its outbreak .
well , if you calculate it , people bought six times a glass of glass , they had six choices to select when they had 24 to choice .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at a point when there was a pause , octavio said , &quot; paul , we could maybe look at the tedtalk . &quot;
but for two weeks , we have programmed , we went to the road to the groundbreaking , my kids were raised , my dog , and we also created this .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the ancient greek historic historians , you might know this story . the story of how video and why games were invented .
but i think in this frame and with intention , from a deception to a real estate , i &apos;m just going to leave the needle in there and go from the stage .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try to look at things , see if it works , if it doesn &apos;t do that , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
a lot of arguments against it . fisheries have the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a large part .
and because they work much harder than we do , and because they only live three to six months , they speak in their weight , in the energy consumption , a little three-billion people .
so if you take the system like me , as i was taught , and all of the eradicated health workers are discarded , then none of them are left .
i think that the remarkable value of the smiling years of last decade is that we &apos;ve been changing from a physical world to a digital world .
so gender is really complicated ; sex is not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some sense , you can spread across the entire bandwidth .
and by the way , we migrate around and circles and mixing us so much that they can &apos;t tell longer that isolation is necessary for evolution to figure out .
of course , the stories that i looked at was the science-fiction area : terminator , &quot; aliens , &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
and in this scenario , they imagine that in a case the sperm is a barchy som that hits the x chromosome of the eggs .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive , to survive and to survive , from the struggle of the human mind , is determined by conflicts .
and i was in the middle of the eighth century after berlin , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and we didn &apos;t have that in kars .
they believed that creativity was a kind of divine mind that comes from a distant source , unknown source of people -- comes from unexplained , unknown reasons .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing marketing issue of prescription for people like you and me , when you think about it , doesn &apos;t make sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
armstrong twittered about us and then , in december of december , the time-magazine touched us as one of the best 50 inventions of 2010 , which was really great .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people use things that we design .
they were the notion that people who had political power to have this political power , because of the bloodline of the grandfather to the son and so on .
i &apos;ve counted some people of the books that have been published with &quot; the title &quot; in the last five years , and they &apos;ve been released for about 40 , and there were much more .
she came from a man , a african-american , sympathy , rau , homeless , who was playing on a spike that had only two sads .
and i went back to the same torture of shame and self-doubt , felt sick and went to work and refused to work again and again .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .

the driver of unmoving objects are not only humans , but the light that seems to them and the wind that seems to them over , and the heat of the space .
but tomorrow , it can make us think of the challenges of the challenges -- think of climate change or climate emissions -- how can we then move from the digital world to the physical .
while i &apos;m doing that , i &apos;m also going to give you some of the lessons that i think you believe it or not , from those abandoned things , nothing to wear new .
it demands that we all do our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking , how our feelings and our emotions do , in our challenge , in the challenge that we face .

it &apos;s not just &quot; code for &quot; micro-lows , &quot; there are hundreds of people around the country who are standing up and writing governance every day in their own communities .

first of all , we &apos;ve saved the doors , and we &apos;ve actually got a device with which he can communicate -- a stephen hawking machine .

but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;re going to think that you &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;re going to be reminded about how this was horrible in ohio . and you &apos;re going to feel that you &apos;ve made the right decision .
i still have to mention that nathaniel has been a medical treatment , because he was already being treated with electrode and with thoroughly and sharp , a trauma that has followed him all his life .
in the view of the living self , if you have a vacation b and the second week is as good as the first one , then the second one is double-smarter doughnut is twice as good as the wine vacuum .
but what happens almost all the time is that the tada is going to become a &quot; uh-uh-oh , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow works that the whole thing is moving and storing .
well , there i am now sitting on the deck of titanic , in a dive boat , looking at these boxes that are kind of like these very similar ones , and i know that the tape has played there .
the movie didn &apos;t bring a money , and he just played his product at all , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like notized by the fours .
when i know something three seconds , until i &apos;m sort of going to come out of the present for the past few slides , i can also do very well , very well , very well , very well , very well in the bridge that i &apos;m going to do it with three seconds .
and what you can do with it , and you can do it all the way to society and ask them to ask and ask , okay , so what do you want to do , what do you want to do with it ?
we put six different flavors there , or 24 different flavors on the line , and we looked at two things : first , first of all , i would be more people stand up and try marker ?
and then the analytical technique , the same engine of science can allow the change to prevent disease , could also give us super-consumers to adopt hyper-adoption , hyper-consumption -- the better roofs .
well , this is a trick that i often spend little kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
we actually created six months later a reality that i found myself in a russian boat , found four kilometers below the north of the german database , and i was looking at the real titanic eye through an eye .
now , since the grades everything else as an accurate record of composing the composers of the composers , but only a framework , i now turn this framework to fill it back up and make sense of meaning .
so , if you have this idea that you will somehow be driven in nature , by the bigger ones , which are immediately going to pull you , then you have to feel that it has to be something like a free will .
and it &apos;s just been done with software , but there &apos;s also in electronics , because there &apos;s a whole host scenes that make electronics of electronics .
and shortly after , on january 19th , they voted in congress for a constant constitution to have a constant progression that is reliable for special areas .
so , i guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras : everything is from the handle camera to professional slums , a pretty large number of them that were swallowed all in this environment .
the second thing that i learned about this day -- and that was when we missed george washington bridge , pretty much the hairese -- i thought there &apos;s a human thing , there &apos;s one thing that i was really owned .
you put l.s. n.a on gold particles , and the gold particles then put into these pressure pebels , and then i put the onion on on , and then put it on the lights like this .
there &apos;s life in life and challenges and challenges that are just real and each person is going to do it differently , but the question is , not whether we &apos;re dealing with widespread or not , but how we &apos;re going to get there .
the only real disability is a broken mind that has broken a mind , has no more hope . it doesn &apos;t find any more beautiful . it matters our natural , natural curiosity , curiosity . and our ability to take advantage of the ability .
and i also have changed my thinking at the time when they asked me at the age of 15 , whether i had been diplying my prosthetic legs against my legs and bones , then i would have delay no second .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture is going to be , as in this case , you know , this days , when you drive the roof down , you get pictures of people who were there saying , &quot; they destroyed the building . &quot;
and that &apos;s what i said , with honesty and transparency , my whole talk , &quot; they &apos;re called transparency , &quot; they &apos;re represented by my good friends of friends , the $ 7,100 for the rights in ebay .
but i have to understand in the core , understand when information is going to become information , when information is going to be made of information and information from information , so that i know how to make things intuitively or intuitively intuitively intuitively intuitively .
the model is already going to jump out in the womb and is cultural , so it works in the world and old and old , and it &apos;s used all of us all the time without the fact that most of us knew that this model has been there .
we &apos;re looking at teams around the world , connecting all these technologies into a mobile phone , so that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s done with ki scaffolding , you can test your blood values or your blood values .

so these are the three major attack groups : criminal groups that do it because of the money , hackers like anonymous , but the last group of nations are governments who lead the attacks .
the other hut that i &apos;ve been wearing in my work is the activist , as an interior lawyer -- or , as i say , as an impatient lawyer -- of people who are physicians .
a couple of years ago , i went to the city , where i grew up in a food market in the middle of the red zone , in the pennsylvania of pennsylvania , and i stood there in front of a tomato tomato .
and my nose always stepped into a book , a science-fiction book that led my thoughts into other worlds , and in a narrative way deep down my sidewalk , injured curiosity .
years ago , when i was studying graduate students , i asked one of my graduate students who knew my interest in feminism -- i was looking at me as a feminist , so they were doing it -- a really curious question .
i want to say that i probably know some helpsile labs that are capable of more sophisticated , more intelligent and more intelligent decisions to meet their sexual relations than some 40-year-old i know .

they warn shiny shiny photos from the air that we would use as the most friendly one , and in the process , they found that these people had never seen the rainforest in their life had never seen anything two-dimensional .
but as the ones that have already made examples of the synonymous dictionaries , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to imagine something that we all wish : to allow every single person to see themselves as powerful .
a lot of aging societies , including the greeks and the tube , really believed that the language of a fluid has a big force , because what you can do is manifest themselves .
and when these tools become more physical and consciousness for their movements , each other and the enemies of our enemies can perceive with them , we can start to start with the research and new entertainment interactions .
if you &apos;re going to fall -- if you &apos;re going to fall in slightly oddly -- i &apos;ve taken a couple of friends in the last night , and some people that i didn &apos;t know , and that i &apos;ve become a woman , and that &apos;s almost an oddly powerful woman .
but the thing about trypd tamins is that they can &apos;t be taken , because , of course , by a human being , of course , with the name of the name of monoid , they &apos;re called &quot; oxidant . &quot;
where i &apos;d experienced most exciting in the last few years , south african channels in capuya last year whose gender was asked by the leading legendary world championships in berlin .
but the question is very simple , if you &apos;re completely independent of any fossil or any of the fossils that are being trained somewhere in the world , and then you &apos;re brought up to an island .
a lot of them are fathers that are forced to let their families go back to work -- sometimes it &apos;s inviting mothers who have to earn enough money to afford food and clothing .
and then it goes back to the front , because the back is not looking at the front , and says , &quot; look , look , please look forward and make sure that what you see is what you want . &quot;
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the digging between the long term and the short term of the people will be horrible between the u.s. and china , between the poor and the rich and the rich and longevity , and almost all of these two billion lives will be much worse .
we &apos;re working in a system in which every day , every day , in which one of the 10 medicines is either a wrong or wrong , in the hospital infections and countless and countless and countless equipment or cause stuff .
bg : exactly . now , you have to refill the reactor , so there are lots and lots of people and lots of controls that can go . this thing where you open it and open it up -- it &apos;s not good !
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma dust , the smallest genome of a species that can replicate themselves in the lab , and we tried to do that with a smaller genome .
if you look at this interesting statistic that has been published recently by a researcher carnegie mellon university , the average young man in a country with strong culture in a strong culture with 10,000 hours of online play to the 21st year .
so , i went from the house , so , of course , i &apos;m also involved with the theme of curiosity , and how the curiosity changes our thinking , and why we might also need curiosity , and we need to be refined again and so on .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a bombsight in this spring , where it &apos;s actually about getting an effort to do something about the funding of the money that &apos;s going to run into politics .
most of the women , as i think -- i think of a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromosome , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like i actually speak on rogenes .
if you allow someone to activate your own inner forces -- the human mind is so fancy -- if you &apos;re willing to do that , and you open it for someone to open a moment , then you &apos;re very good for these people .
that means you found that by talking about common language , you could communicate with each other , is in the same cave , or in other areas , in other areas , or in villages , and that kind of trigger society .
we need solutions , either one or two of them have a uniquely unimaginable and unimaginable disorder , and even though there are many directions where people are looking after that , i really only see five who can afford these big demands .
now , when i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of them are government officials , some of them come from science , some of them , some of them come from the economy . here &apos;s my chef . and one comes from the music area .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been working now for a few years now for a couple of years with the biohacking , and i &apos;ve just started to know , because i just wanted to know it , and i wanted to do it even what i learned in the study of theoretically .
and i left the medical school of the impression that i knew if i knew everything i knew and knew everything , or at least as much as possible , as close as possible as possible as i could do , that i was wrong against error .
and then , if i go one step further into these natural interfaces , where i have a voice , language , language , gestures and don &apos;t have to tap over and over the cursor , the cursor has to be faster and even more immediate .
that means , i &apos;ve actually locked them up now , that they don &apos;t recognize more patterns in the middle , but i &apos;ve dipped them down within a shorter period of time to see this dog in this dog .
because right now , where i turn my hand away from you , so you see them moving from the back , this finger here , my fingers , just from where he was , in a position , in which he &apos;s extended .
not to burn the enlightenment , to burn a little bit better , and put it into the burning facility , to lose materials for circles , but first to ask how do you create shallow circles ?
the first thing that i saw was this idea that their brand personality had separated two , but has been separated by side -- the murmural march is an eight-hour marke .
in other services , like fertilizers of fertilizers , 105 : 55 : 565 -- likes up ; 05 : 55 : 55 : 585 or airline airline airline airline , the space for very small improvement .
we see this here when i put things up , i can make them confusing , like the right side of the right , where i don &apos;t know what salts and psalts , or i can make them intuitively design by showing things .
because this is what it turns out : if you offer a placebo in a white pill , in the form of a form of aspiring , it &apos;s just a round of round , white pills that has a certain measurement effect .
the coal proliferation of industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a big deal in the global supply chain , and so we have refrigerators , we can create climate change , we can produce modern materials and do so many things .
we took the light out , we put it in a vacuum , put it in a vacuum , put the whole air out of the air , and we refrigerated it all right now , the metal was free of metal , all the way that it wanted to act .
but because that &apos;s not happening here , we can push it down , and people like jenny mccarthy can walk around and fear of anxiety and illiteracy areas of platforms like oprah and larry king .
together , together , the uncounted cultures of the world are building a web of spiritual and cultural life , which is the earth , and probably the importance of the earth is as important as the biological network you know it as biosphere .
for example , if you take this child from barasana in the west of the amazon , the people of the people who believe that they were the mythologically of the middle east , they also came from the sacred herself .
some bacteria have figured out how to keep themselves from penicillin , and have this information with other bacteria written into the dna , and now we have lots of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate .
and i want to say something that is a feminist something radically radical , and that is that i think there might be different kinds of insights that could apply the different kinds of species of anatomy , especially when people think about a group of groups .
now , let me introduce you to the elephant of amanda boxbox , which is a 19 years ago , a spinal cord injury , which has been the result that she couldn &apos;t walk more than 19 years or so far .
something interesting happened in &quot; abyss , &quot; to solve a narrative in this film -- and we had to create a kind of liquid water -- we had to create liquid creatures , we came back to computer animation animation , cg .
and dr. kean kept on telling him , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that when you &apos;re not getting anything else , and even if you get a little bit of support , if you get a little bit of support for children , then you can get a lot of kids . &quot;
when we get to these really big gaps -- with over 100,000 base pairs -- they &apos;re not just going to grow in ecoli . it &apos;s going to grow up . it &apos;s all the possibilities of modern molecular biology . and so we &apos;re going to change other mechanisms .
and i realized that at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an outsider , a neutral , a newly new , in the image -- and not just okay , but something that you have to be grateful , maybe a gift of the boots .
and so i get from the city of town to a very different view , a very different impression , which i see negative and positive city , and i look at a city like this , in a way , in a very different way , a virtual map of a very real city .
but that &apos;s the most networking thing that can happen , because this is forced to help groups to help patients , because it could be used against obesity , or it could be the patients that would eradicate the space .
as i said , i &apos;ve spent a few years going into some terrible situations , but nothing could be prepared me , nothing could do , anything that was so difficult and dangerous with these guys in a room .
and that &apos;s very amazing , because you actually believe that this technology that you &apos;re going to encounter with is that the one that actually brings you to the future , but in fact , it &apos;s so that the future is right at us , with our archaeal roots .
and because i was born without an orphanage , and my feet had taken place to them , and i only had a few toes on this one and a few toes on the other , he was the overwhelming , that strangers had to get the bad news .
but it would be worse if i wasn &apos;t going to remember that i was talking about 20 years ago when i first told the teenagers that i wanted to be the same kind of quiet response .
when we &apos;re in a game world , i think a lot of us turn into our best version of yearns and are currently ready to help harnessness the problem of trying to solve the problem as long as it takes to the disposal .
and there &apos;s only one of these little devices , because the things should always be intuitive , natural user , friendly , and you have to look at what &apos;s really for us , of course , what &apos;s used to be used or intuitive .
have you no fear that you &apos;re living your work for a long time , and you &apos;re never going to get something out and that you &apos;re going to run on a scrotated dreams -- your mouth will die your mouth with the bitter of the gear ?
and when i get a halfway down , we don &apos;t even see even a unit , just a unit , a circle , and we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a different circle .
they took those photographs from the forest to the ground , trying to see behind the face , or the figure , and they found nothing , and concluded that this would be the visitor of the devil devil devil cards , and the defeated five of the spears with the spears .
i used to write my synonym book dictionary , but i was involved with the writing of the texture , and i realized that i &apos;ve never beaten in my life , which means &quot; disabled . &quot;
so , what &apos;s happening is that , with this sentence , and with this sentence , i &apos;d like to close , and give a clue to the clues , designers need to think differently , to come up with new solutions , and in this sense , thank you very much for your attention and please .
and i definitely know it &apos;s for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to catch this dark pathway , to sort of cheat the point of view -- especially in which i was in my career right now .
the older man stood up . he looked at the deputy puty , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come to say this boy to say this young man , they don &apos;t lose the goal . they don &apos;t give birth . &quot;
so , the problem of cooperative online worlds such as the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so peaceful , at the moment at the edge of a victory that we prefer to spend our entire time in this game .
later on day , i was driving on this basic piece of guel around and i asked him , &quot; i said , &quot; for a place where , of course , &quot; as every farm that i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how did you succeed ? &quot;
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice captivity , which had three million years to the size of the lower 48 states , 40 percent shrinking .
in urban communities everywhere -- from los angeles across philadelphia , baltimore than washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all the young men , either in jail , in jail , leaving curriculum or conditions .
immediately after that election , between the 21st and the 24th of february , a third deaths of about 30 famine to the two places in the world that were most interested in getting to the business of the city .
so the last example that i have time to show this is a musician sequencing for live fiber , which we &apos;ve developed recently and in the foundations as a lethal voice , like leadership and bass .
and we started to create pieces , starting with stones -- fifth to seventeous letters , put them together to make 24,000-mile letters to put those back together until 27,000 .
they made us to tell the story of the neuromarketing , as we tell the story in this film , that now you &apos;re using mris to make the luck of the brain , both through advertising and advertising movies .
so i started thinking , and i think , in the past few months , while i was working on the book , it &apos;s going to seem soon -- as the dangerous , scary , strong , expected cing of my success .
both in my profession , robin laden and my side man as a volunteer volunteer , i &apos;m a witness of generosity and generosity , but i also look at the next stage of love and the individual .
suppose you live in a certain area of remote and you loved one of those people with loaded heart disease , and you &apos;ve overwhelmed your doctor to a doctor whose cardiologists are at the average level of representation .
but when i started with him , and i asked him why he did this intervention -- it was high surgeries -- his answer was that in his country , that these kids would be treated very bad , and so he had to do it .
and , of course , when is also a little bit intuitive , and how i can do it as an age of influence and just design the things that are designed so that they &apos;re using a friendly user , so they &apos;re intuitively intuitively intuitively intuitively intuitively , because they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re just used to use .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t make any . those who make the battleys , and without the constraints that are constrained with bad results and the good results .
it &apos;s got three big problems . the cost is , especially in high-regulated countries , and the question for safety is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human work , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do , because we &apos;re afraid we &apos;re really afraid to have a real gasoline , and it holds millions of people from flourishing .
now , to choose no glass of glass to buy is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our potato -- but it turns out that the decision-making problem is also very , very powerful decisions .
i don &apos;t have to do these things for emotionally , because the corner is going to be a different kind of crazy , colorful , tipping of the outfit , just waiting for me when i have a little love in the heart and search for it .
so this is one of the effect . the other is that even if we overcome the paralysis and we make a decision , we have less satisfaction with the outcome of choice than if we had the opportunity to decide less .
this is a photograph that i took on the northern iron of the baffin islands , when i went to the foods on the whale al jagd . and this man , aolya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the remembered self , and you can think of the memory itself as a reminder of the living self that doesn &apos;t need to be alive .
i mean , if i &apos;m in the alone , i do all kinds of weird things , but then i get to other people , and i listen to all these things , because i don &apos;t want to do it , or frankly , they &apos;re disappearing .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to use abundance and less , but in the average , this number is going to go up every year and get more than twice the number of services that are provided per person .
i met these people from grass , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows you to project any light surface on any surface , and then draw with a laser pointer to draw on the area of the negative regions .
so what that means is when we look back at what &apos;s going on in evolution , and how we think about the place of people in evolution , and particularly as we &apos;re looking at the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a set of possibilities .
so there &apos;s great challenges here . there are challenges in transmission . if we say that the power of the country is outside the country , they don &apos;t just need to have the technology to deal with the risk of where the energy comes from .
but , as we think , the only kind of biology is going to have a huge impact of no other cost of food , or limitation of its availability , when we see co2 as co2 as a co2 material , and therefore we &apos;re working on these cells .
i started working in the scientific literature on how these centrifuels are built into natola and found out that they are structured in so-called kaaskaaskahn , and each kamal 164 .
now , the fascinating thing is that the beetle color contains in the liane , mao-inhio bitors of the kind of thing that &apos;s necessary to ask the tamia . so , you ask yourself .
this is a problem , because the global warming is given to the arctic ocean , where there are huge amounts of frozen carbon , which is when it &apos;s put up by microbes .
what we found also is that the goal of the attack was actually to make it slow and uncurable -- obviously in the trying to desperate engineer engineers so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get behind it quickly .
so maybe it &apos;s a margin of this technological change , because the more that there was always a different truth , that every person of society can give something very special , and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt , our plus .
my good friend ray short-term showed us that every tool that will cause information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , makes it great jump , and the price performance of performance oil for 24 to 24 months .
the first project that we did as an international group , when we became aware of ourselves , o.k , there &apos;s us right now as a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people who are there and so on .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never be as moving as much as other kids , or that you could never have a independent life , and since then they just punished me . &quot;
what if we could flip this situation and put the internet on the head so that instead of going from one to another , we can start to go from a lot of things to many things , and by realizing what pattern would be hidden ?
this is what we feel so guilty to the earth that we say , there &apos;s no bio-state building , no bioluminescence , no suburbs of propoke , and like all of you , that allow our own excrement to go back .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i found something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in livelihood , each cell , and all the genetic information that is kept on in both dead cells .
it was worth it for me to put all this year in the clean room , because they testified the massage between a single piece of metal , and all of this metal is about how the difference between the metal and all of them .
and i then put it up to six-and-a-half millennia , and then we got together with friends , and i got a co-founder of the company , and then i got together with the lane in the middle of an area of the largest cell manufacturer in the world .
at the time , it was just like a monkey ront , where skull , and other people said , you &apos;re really crazy , when the people are beginning to read the people , then they want to talk about it , and of course , that &apos;s completely fatal .
if a representation in spain has something impossible , something magical has done : allah , ollah , ol√© , allah , allah , great , unpleasant , it &apos;s a whirlful look at god .

but we don &apos;t even know if we listen to somebody like this because we &apos;ve been familiar with this kind of time for a long time , and somehow we &apos;ve been so interdepending on the idea and so on that creativity and creativity somehow , of course , and that art belongs -- at the end of the seal .
and what we did was actually to use a new kind of network around the world -- this is a mobile phone net -- and anonymous and aggregated information from this network , which is actually collected from the middle east to understand how the city works .
and then the renaissance and everything changed , and we had this big idea . and this big idea was , let &apos;s tell us put the human individual into the center of the universe -- all of the gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no more space for mystical creatures adoption from the divinity .
in our desire to protect the people we care about in the hearts and the cold , harsh truth about their medical projections , or even a proliferation to the quality of life that you need to expect , we don &apos;t need to adjust the basic stone to make sure that somebody is actually disabled .
i told you about four techniques that are the problem of decision-making charges -- are constrained -- they &apos;re going to confront the liquid alternatives ; they make it real ; they do it real ; we can better -- we can do better with categories , fewer ways .
because we have this self-deception , this sense of being great , abandoned by the highest beings , not from such a representation , from something like an unpredictable organism , like an organism that exists in the same way , and one of the things that &apos;s otherwise unsustainable for us .
and that &apos;s when you &apos;re all feeling about your feelings and the snakes of labor , and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about is the government , in the core , in the words of tim lly , what we &apos;re doing , which we can &apos;t do together alone .
so this is probably going to seem like something that &apos;s going on , so i repeat it , so i can make it work that if we can solve problems like hunger , poverty , global warming , global conflict and obesity and obesity , i think we need to try online for at least 21 billion hours a week to play the next week .
and our goal was , we wanted to go to seventh to necessity percent renewable , and then there is another one , the last one , the last 10 percent , 20 percent renewable , which is going to be very expensive , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work out of batteries .
but it turns out that 17 marbrand partners who were willing to be willing to pay on these control , who wanted to do business with somebody like this , and how i do , and the ones that allowed us to tell us about stories that we wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell -- the stories that would usually be a weekend .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never get reasonable , whether it &apos;s going to work , but since there &apos;s modern supercomputers , you can simulate it , and you can see that , yes , with the right material galistic approach , it looks like it &apos;s working out of it .
but the process and the heavy climbing , which was surrounded by him , when he took out of the genius , where he wasn &apos;t going to go back , and he sort of left him where he came back , and he realized that there was no elderly , elderly , his elderly thing .
this particular event was that i recently wrote a book -- a biography called pray , pray , love -- which , which , unlike all of my previous books , for some reason in the world , and a big mega-scale event , international polarization .
a continent is always left out because the assumption that there was no religious faith in sub-saharan africa , and of course there was a voodoo , and the voodoo is just the remaining of this very profound religious thought , while the tragedies were coming through the slavery of slavery .
but in fact , we see it more and more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to be limited , and the unimportant opportunities are going to be , well , then there &apos;s a increase in sales of sales , there &apos;s the cost , the cost , and there &apos;s a improvement of perception of perception .
and one day , he looked at me at one of my usual practices -- these practices were just humbled and gdend -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so strong , you &apos;re a powerful , and you &apos;re going to be able to be able to get a girl , and one day you &apos;re going to be one of those dancing one of the frogs .
and the wind and the sun and the load , and the outcome came to the outcome , a very exciting result of the conclusion that you need to be a conventional system , after 20 years , it takes about five cents a mile per kilowatt-hour , it takes about four cents per hour .
and the problem is , it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can be a very easy problem , and it can just be a contribution of what things are like , so a very simple problem of solving , a problem , and how you can do it differently , or how to do it better .
filling crops of plant crops , snakes , low-income means of monoons , chemicals on earth , chickens up on fish , and the whole time has simply asked the agricultural industry , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how can this be ? &quot;
not through the latest respiratory art and tractoral inventions , but through fruit land , not through pumps , but through pump , not by fresh water , not by chains , but by forests and forests , not by the fish and boats , but by fish in the sea .
these are the ones that have a more artistic direction , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and philosophers who are working with scientists to deal with these technologies and asking questions and asking creative questions , because there are museum exhibitions and all kinds of things .
they consume the amount of carbon dioxide , which leads to temperature , and this temperature has a number of very negative consequences . in fact , the weather , and perhaps worse , the result that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t look at the natural ecosystems that can &apos;t look at all these changes and collapse .
the chat-bends are things that are playful , like the prince , time-consuming , abandoned , abandoned and loved how flynn , fleet , agile and agile , of profits , of profits , of magic , magical , and magical mythic .
in other words , they didn &apos;t draw fast enough . they ran and ran and ran , but they didn &apos;t get the house , and they didn &apos;t cut the poem through them through them , and they were passing it . she said it would move beyond country , and as she said -- she said , she looked for another woman .
and maybe that will contribute to a moderate , and if they &apos;re better than i expect , that would be great , but my core statement here is that we have to work on all the jones five , and we can &apos;t give you any of them , because they &apos;re shy , because everyone has significant problems .
and where you can see how far we &apos;re going to get away from what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , we can be on earth at all , you can see that for example , for example , an open program , until four days you want to be here , you want to be euclient here , right ?
in my 2020 , 20 years of medical knowledge and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study on medical errors and wrong treatments for all of my first article that i wrote to the star for my star show to my star show , &quot; borcohen , &quot; to learn to learn .
so with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what &apos;s on the old thinking , don &apos;t say that in the lash , it &apos;s not a laser flesh , and it &apos;s no longer a beef or any other phenomena , which i just want to do that , and that &apos;s what i want to do with virtue .
now , not exactly what i &apos;d hoped to do , but i went off -- the treasure , the flur , along the &quot; the real fireman , &quot; which at that point , at that point , were pretty finished in the room to get some sleep .
i had to repeat individual activities finally repeatedly with these pockets , elastic trees -- in different colors -- that you know , to build my leg muscles , and i hated that more than anything else . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
but we wanted to go a lot further . we wanted to build a whole bacterial chromosome . it has more than 50,000 letters code code . so we thought we were able to build it in the size of the virus that we could get the size of the cell to understand what the individual components are .
and from a conversation this morning , with dekaman , one of the innovators &apos;s innovators , i want to share with you something -- he gave me the permission -- his engineering , which is called &quot; the slingness , &quot; and of many of you may have heard it . it has the size of an orphanage of a student at home .
&quot; clouds , &quot; something that my friends in autodesk call &quot; high-volume , &quot; sensory &quot; sensors , sensors and networks , robots , 3d printer that allow us to democratize personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , vaccine , biology and digital food , digital medicine , nano-artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence .
you can see these amazing demonstrations : voodoo &apos;s accomplishment in a transmission that &apos;s going to burn the light bulbs without burning , an amazing accent of the mind to affect the body so that it &apos;s going to be able to reconcile a state of extremes in the extremes of the extremes .
this was the most surreal form of a d√©ju vu , which i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i got a corner of a bow , i always knew what was going on in the light of the car , because i was going to run a monthly movie .
in this picture , i put a bus on my head as a center of desperation in all directions , because if you look at the rings of the tree of life , all of the existing specialities in the two of these two things have succeeded in evolutionary terms , it has survived ; it has taken its environment and demonstrates its strength .
and the premise with this premise with this premise , for example , brian debris trying to put a minimum together a minimum , and then a steam costume , a hot plate , and yes , torture , and so on , and then bacteria grew up , and then bacteria worked out of it .
and then it came from the do-it-it-or-beat-org website , and the founder of the green , and i said , &quot; oh , we &apos;ve got to make a real time , we &apos;ve got to make real real real , and then have two organized events in london , a second , two thousand , 10 , and short in the s.a in san francisco , in san francisco .
so this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- that you want to get zero , and that will depend on the number of people , depending on the services , every person in the average , the average energy in the average , the average energy , and the co2 , which will emitate the energy per unit .
and the realization of president lobo was that the certainty of the sentiment that i thought about was a way to get the foreign investors to come together and build this city in equals all partisan partisan , which has been a lot of fear of fear for many years and sufficient sufficists .
i read this list that i had to read on a friend according to the first time , it was so ridiculous , but i just came up to &quot; and i couldn &apos;t stop talking , &quot; and i had to stop reading and stop reading , and i had to stop thinking about the extent of this extrateral flight and the emotional shock and the emotional shock of the shock .
a group of aranka that i learned a few times a while ago , which is a student who wanted to convey a student who wanted to convey more of what she wanted to learn in the uncollege , and have been able to explain the sighest little actors and explain to people what n.a. is .
there are 175 addresses in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the extra 10 extra extra ovarian cells , and 12 balessions that you could buy to make a large number of sales in your own sales , which is not the case that the 175 is right for you .
and this was really , really , really , really , really bitter , and then you get into this phase , which is just going through a picture where i was thinking about 10 years ago , and a thousand years ago , the most basic , lovely , lovely , lovely , of course , whether it really should be the great thing to be .
first of all , i &apos;m going to show you what i &apos;m going to do , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , which is a new technology that we have as a part of an exception just a year ago , which is the seadragon . and it &apos;s a phone , and it &apos;s a local environment , either , or you can handle huge amounts of visual data from visual data .
the first one , if you &apos;re going to be a child , as a baby , is that you care about what you &apos;ve got , what you &apos;ve got , what you &apos;ve got ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed them to play , or playing more in the lethal and the less , the more , the more , the curiosity , the curiosity , the curiosity is , of course .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i eradicated this -- you know , the psychological presence of about three seconds long . what it means is that there are about 600 million lives in a month . in a month , there are about 600,000 . most of them don &apos;t leave behind them .
bill gates : to run on a supercomputer , to get all the great scientists , we &apos;ve only done a few million , and even when we &apos;ve tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s reasonable , you &apos;re only in the 100 million .
it really works , it &apos;s going to work in the academic , and then we thought , o.k , we might get there , then maybe we &apos;ve taken a webcam , which is made up of smoking , which is turned the lens , then you have a microscope , you zoom in a microscope , which is about four hundred times a hundred times a hundred times .
if i show you 600 magazines , and you put them in 10 categories , or i &apos;m going to show you 400 newspapers , and those in 20 categories , you &apos;ll think that i &apos;ve given you more choice , and i &apos;ve given a better choice than i &apos;ve given you the 400 of the ones that i would have given to you when i gave them 600 .
&apos;it &apos;s friday friday . god walks down . &apos; andon friday . &apos; yes , &apos; &quot; &apos; &quot; the cameras are clear . &apos; &quot; friday . &apos; friday friday . &apos; friday friday friday . &apos; you didn &apos;t think that we &apos;d lead this conversation without having to talk about this video , i hope .
i think a significant channel -- not the only one , but a significant explosion of the explosion of depression , and also self-homicide , is that people have experienced deception because their standards are so high , and then , if you have to explain those experiences , it would be true , it would be true .
the neolithic revolution that brought us to agriculture , and in that moment , the searching of the saatl , the poetry of the proverbial , through the proliferation of the prosthetic , and archy , and special transformed us , and just 10,000 years ago -- rather than 10,000 years ago .
this is when you put a laser on a room , you can catch a little particles in the room , and then you can catch little particles in the air or in the liquid , and then move into the liquid , so that &apos;s where there &apos;s a tractory line , like a tractory principle , like a toronto the torture principle .
well , it would be great if we could put this paradigm on another level of options , or the strength of strength , to even make it a little bit more dangerous , exchange . so we could release the forces of very young children , and invite them to bring their special comprehension and valuable skills into society .
you know , you know , when michelangelo loses the moses , it means that at the end of the hammer , and he took him on mosque -- in fact , they can still see a little bit of bottom of them -- and she said , &quot; perchude perch , perfume pari ? why don &apos;t you say , &quot;
but if you buy a new year in 2011 today , you buy a new color printer printer from the leading canvas and print a page , then you have this bright blob on every page on every page , in a pattern that makes you clear on your back and forth .
now , my colleague , with the aspirage , you could take a lot more about the true , and the many other wonderful things that you can do with real things , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we &apos;re discussing at the beginning , and that &apos;s the environment that we &apos;re doing .
now , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have the sympathy , the sympathy for the harm of the harassed , as though they &apos;re looking at orgasoline and colorful , but they &apos;re sort of limited to the past , while the real world , our world , our symbols .
and i then tried to do this in my lab in my home lab a little bit , and then i got so hard to buy a hand-hands-on ebay , and i bought a little bit of n.n. analysis analysis , which is trying to do a dad , so , and so , in fact , this case , the n.n. printing printing printing printing printing printing printing to get home .
and if you would choose another vacuum b , there would be a conflict between your two species of self , and you have to think about how you really choose to decide , and that &apos;s not really obvious , because if you think of time in the sense , and you get an answer . and if you could think of remembering a different answer , you could get another answer .
in the early 800s , i got a really amazing task when my professor at harvard asked if i was interested in going to haiti and filmed the secret societies , which were the foundation of duvsky and maton , and that was used to make it safe to make it .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell you how i &apos;m going to deal with wizard , and i &apos;m going to stand up with something : this sentence has never fought for me , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable to answer the questions of people , and i think , i think , really understand why i understand why .
and now , if i translate this , for example , for example , in the orient-oriented view , selective selection , as an informed choice , in which all of which , it can come up to me , i can look at detail in the detail , and yes , i can also throw this up or throw it down somewhere or buy somebody , and so on .
i recommend you all to read steam book , or see the film , so they don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that came between these two men , but also how music helped make the music connect , and how it was ultimately the instrument , when this game is allowed to get out of the middle of the road .
so here in the picture , you can see the lab , in leader , so it &apos;s kind of a garage with all sorts of labs , which has been exposed to the instructions that a group in paris , which has been successful , and it &apos;s pretty interesting and it &apos;s also very interesting , because i want to do a project for a while .
no biologist would say , for example , to say that 50 percent or more of all species are going to die just before they die , because it &apos;s not easy . and yet , this -- the apocalyptic sarians on the area of biological diversity -- barely what we think is known as the most optimistic act on the diversity of cultural diversity .
bg : well , we haven &apos;t yet set up to a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting legislation for everything called &quot; nuclear coar . &quot; there are big interest in the developing world , and the people in russia , india , india , china -- and i &apos;ve met the energy here , and i &apos;ve talked about how this floods to energy .
the computer visions have given these images together so they put them in the real room where all of the images that were made near the grassland lake in the canadian kes , and they see elements of stages here , or pandean ornism and all these things were put together in each other .
and if you look at the software that we &apos;ve just seen , you &apos;ll also understand why ninety-nine percent of our software is not intuitive or at usb , it &apos;s in many ways that we &apos;ve seen in i-to-many areas , but that &apos;s much more intuitive , even more intuitive to be classified as software .
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; it sounds like a good thing , but in reality , there &apos;s a shift in the burden of responsibility for making the decisions for the decisions of somebody &apos;s making -- namely the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing about it -- and probably won &apos;t be sick , and that &apos;s why the best choice is to make a constituency -- in fact , the patient &apos;s a constituency of the patient .
and this idea , when i was in the middle of the process , i was in the middle of desperate , pray , and i fell into one of those two slides of the two that we &apos;re all going to fall into , when we &apos;re working on something and you &apos;re not going to do it . you think it &apos;s going to be a disaster that &apos;s going to be written . that &apos;s the worst book ever written .
we also have one of these same aggregators in the same size , as he says there , in the halfway , to actually look at the full dynamic behavior of this network , so in the half-half-half-able now , the el stands up here , the large battery here is the battery , the whole bath with which we simultaneously simultaneously simulate the grid .
and they believed that a genius that this kind of magical creature was credible by believing that it literally lives in the beaches of an artist &apos;s studio in the art of an elite -- like dobby , the elevators -- and the artist &apos;s got to work in a certain amount of work , and the outcome that would make the work done .
now , if i want to give you one thing today , it &apos;s that the overall data that we consume is larger than the sum of its parts , instead of thinking about information , i want to think about how we can use information , and that &apos;s how we &apos;re going to recognize patterns , and we &apos;re going to see the most visible ones that were not visible .
so we &apos;ve done a study in a study that i &apos;ve done with shlomo beni and alessro tero , we &apos;ve done a study with people -- all the ones that have been working for -- and all these people in a gathering of the collection in their business plan for their savings .
interesting historic footage : when the mosquitos were brought back to these uses . the language changed over the centuries of centuries of allah , allah , allah , allah , mool√© , naol√© , inhabit , you &apos;re still fighting with sticks on the fight and flesman . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
now , today , you need , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this -- something that has translated into the car , a few thousand sensors that have made up of the information that &apos;s going on in the car , and then you &apos;re going to work on and use that car to make these decisions back to make things back and make things happen back in real time , while it &apos;s going to change information .
i was afraid , not fear , but i was afraid that i could lose it , that it could sink in its circumstances , and that i could destroy his relationship to the mind if i started to destroy , i started to talk about pitch and argents and other forms of ingenuity , and i could talk to the trajectory of selfission .
so , in fact , the fact is that if you remember the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not for its wars or technical innovations , it &apos;s more than a era , in which we were against the massive and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity of the earth either active or passive , so that &apos;s the problem that &apos;s not the change .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar &quot; avatar , &quot; which was the measurements of visual effects and computer effects in a very effective way in which i should shoot more powerful , more realistic , more realistic , expressive characteristic that had been made . and the characters should all be main cg . and the world should be cg .
i &apos;m probably going to hear , i &apos;m probably going to hear the two niches of girls because i &apos;m probably listening to the generation that has saved this bad image for this bad image , because i have hundreds of thousands of ned-class imned-class machines already to study incentives in loud , technical art , which is now , i think it &apos;s going to be high school today , i think , i think it &apos;s kit .
now , i &apos;d like to start with you an example of someone who had a new answering recession after one of my lectures , the story of a story . &#91; unclear &#93; &#91; unclear &#93; -- he said he &apos;d heard a sincerous , and it was absolutely gorgeous , and at the end of the music , and at the end of the fractable , there was a terrible sound of the sound .
you know ? i think you know ? i think one of the things that he thinks he thinks he or she &apos;s like the vessel , and the essence and the essence and the source of all the divine , unknown , unknown , unmysterious mysterious mysterious , is a little bit too small to give them a hope of a human questioning .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economically economic , and at the same time the co2 , the skeptics also say , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t interest me that there &apos;s no carbon footage that i wish that it was going to do it , but i guess it &apos;s probably because it &apos;s cheaper than the cheap method . &quot;
it &apos;s actually the kind of decisions that you make , because if you have a patient who has two reflections in two different surgeons , and what he &apos;s supposed to choose is that the one who has chosen , the memory is less , and that &apos;s the surgeon , the surgeon , is the surgeon , the surgeon , the surgeon , the surgeon is going to be selected .
you know , all of you know the healthy shame , if you have a mystery of the best prior of the price , even though there &apos;s a shooter and then you get caught and you get the best friend and you confront a friend and you confront a terrible debate , and if you take a bad thing at the end of the bottom , you get a certain error , you never make a mistake like this .
you know , you know , one of the great reasonable reasons , and one of the joys that &apos;s in the nography research is in common with people who are still remember the old days . the past is still in the past , they still touch the wind in the rain , they touch a blown in the bitter of the planners .
if you ever have the chance to have the opportunity to work in your urban center , as our scott silent part of the program -- in fact , they &apos;re all going to do -- you &apos;re all going to see that the people who call them a lot of different problems , including a greenhouse in your house .
this is actually a beautiful thing , if you do this , agriculture , biogas , generates on a hectare with fifth-graders in favelas , so that you can wait about a hundred million dollars a hundred dollars and wait for the chickens , and the chickens , and make a vegetable and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables .
we &apos;re at the threshold of amazing , amazing events in many areas , but i really think that we have to go back hundreds of years ago to find a time where we have a progress in progress where we &apos;ve been struggling with things about these things , more than we &apos;ve been doing now .
so by making color , by changing color , contrast and heroes to the individual images , photographing photographers , photographic birds , such as rocks , acquired , disruptive colors and colors , we &apos;re pulling the limits between the borders and different images , and how they make a single photo look , even though there &apos;s a picture of an old layers of old layers of old .
if i had a room full of colleagues in a room full of colleagues and asked their sovereign support , and i would tell them what i &apos;ve just told them , i probably wouldn &apos;t achieve the second end of the story , before it really would be unpleasant , someone would have a joyful joke , and they would forget the subject and forget the rest of it .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good moment to turn your audiences , take your personal communications -- i &apos;ll give you the action -- and maybe you can throw a viewer on your shoulder &apos;s shoulder &apos;s book , because nothing else is going to be on this talk for you .
a few years ago , the laser prize was given to the scientist shinya yamana for his research in which he took a adults , a broader blasts , and through manipulation of just four genes to lead them to a pluripotent stem cell -- a potentially soviet cell in the body is able to be able to be anywhere in a body .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve made all kinds of batteries that are made , look at the cars , the computers , cell phones , cell phones , lamps , everything , and i &apos;ve done a lot of the electronic energy that uses the world , and i &apos;ve found that all batteries that we &apos;re making , that are now making less than 10 minutes of tension .
now let &apos;s go back to the time of the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of creatures , maybe three to four billion years ago , on earth -- the first majority of the earth , maybe as much as a billion years ago , and then the human species , which have been formed in the last couple of years .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral of the cathedral notre , which ended up in the computer with flickr successes . they just give the emergency room in flickr , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in the t-shirts and at the university of all these colored farms , and so each of these colored farms represented as a model that was discovered as a model of this model .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old south , we &apos;re building people -- here &apos;s risk to be convicted , elevated , elevators , when the victim is , when it &apos;s black , when 22 times diverse , the black is white , and the victim is white and the victim is white -- in the same state , in which the earth is the body of the human body .
i used to travel with a young colleague of 6,000 miles in western country in china with southeast linga to hate , and when i went to la , i saw the face of statistics . 6,000 mons turned out to be turned 1.2 million , and 1.2 million people turned into the cultural revolution during the island of cultural revolution .
and so , the idea is that , now , if you have all kinds of problems that have something to invest in something that you &apos;ve only got what you &apos;ve got -- and it &apos;s not that investment is so clear . the pc cc is not necessarily the worst climate we have , and there are all sorts of people in the rich world , the rich world , the ipcc , and it &apos;s okay , okay , that &apos;s not a big deal .
we put the chromosome on the chromosome of a microbes . big , these two are far apart like humans and mice , so we could extract some extra chromosome to choose this chromosome -- we could destroy it with all the enzymes to destroy proteins , and it was very astonishing , and it was a very astonishing cell -- and we would make it very appreciate , and we would estimate our very well estimate here .
margaret mead , the great anthropologist said before she died , it &apos;s the greatest fear that as we move to the direction of the subject , generous generic view , not just the entire bandwidth of human imaginative , but we would have been reduced that one day from a dream , and we &apos;ve ever forgotten a dream , and never forgotten out that there were any other possibilities .
i &apos;d like to just show you one of the original data sets of noah &apos;s noah , and this is from a early prototype of photosynth synth , where we &apos;ve been working on the summer of the summer to show what i think it &apos;s really the pointer of this technology , the photosynthetic technology , and this is not necessarily because if you look at the environments that we &apos;ve looked at on the website .
in some words with other words , sugar pillars have shown in some studies of a measurable effect , the placebo effect , and just because the person thinks what happens to her , is a pharmaceutical , or a kind of pharmaceutical management , for example , there &apos;s only one of the patient who believes , there &apos;s only one effect on the body that &apos;s called the placebo , which is the placebo effect .
when one of them said no , it was the fate cattle that broke a very broken mall . i &apos;ve spent 10 years on it for 10 years , whether i &apos;m going to study my great engineers , maybe a really fun thing , because all the colleagues of my father used to give him a piece of money , you &apos;ve got the money in your window for a child .
i had recently encountered such an encounter when i met the extraordinary american poet dwith stone , who was now about 90 , but the whole life of her life , and she told me that , when she was growing up in the villages of virgin virginia , she would listen to the field , and she would listen to feel like a poem about how a poem on the poem .
it means that a small child from the annie who grows in the belief that the mountain is a puppet , or her destiny , will determine a whole other human being , and another relationship to this particular resource or this place , as a little kid growing out of montana , that grows into the mountain , that a mountain is a picking up a pistle .
and i usually have my role in explaining to people how wonderful new technologies are going to come to be , and i thought , here i am under my friends , i &apos;m really thinking , and i &apos;m really trying to figure out what i &apos;m going to look back and see what &apos;s going on here , and what &apos;s going on with these incredible technologies , and what &apos;s going on in the front of the way that we can &apos;t stop raping out .
and that would be your answer to the bjunidilomg argument that if you use all of this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , to solve all the other targets , the targets , the poverty reduction of malaria , and so on , that it &apos;s a waste of dumpant resources , where there &apos;s money to invest in things that we can do better things that we can do .
these people have come online to rice , but they &apos;ve made it illegal by using tropical tropics to get money from our bank accounts , while we &apos;re not doing our online banks , or the vibrant information that have collected over the keyboard , while we buy a computer online , we buy a computer online centuries online .
and again , the parks came back to montomgoma , where they wear two of their oldest friends . these older women , johnny carr , who organized the monty-bus boomers -- an incredible african-american -- and virginia , a white man , whose clifford man , clifford man , dr. kfford . &amp; r &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and there are two bastles that have been put together , and said , o.k , we &apos;re doing cheap and cheaper , and then just open source resource out open source , free hardware , electronics , electronics , this device , and now the market is actually brought into the market , and now the market is the most cheap and the cheapest of the world .
and that made me go to another person than my friends under the kotutl , believe that these forests are the forests of the humility of cake and the dubious boxes and the canopy , the nightingbird , the norway to the norwegian world , the spirists that they would engage in their native initiation .
a week ago , the national academy council of engineering council for francis nold and wilderness , two scientists , who encourage independently developed the natural process to encourage the natural process of evolution to do faster , and to lead proteins to proteins to a proteins in a franchise , which is called &quot; arnold evolutionary evolution . &quot;
and right now , as it happens in biology , and since i want to take this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , that biology is actually a science of information , because the n.n. code is a abstract code , it &apos;s not just the computer , it &apos;s like computers , because it &apos;s a matter of matter , so it &apos;s old matter , so it &apos;s not only true , and it &apos;s real , and it &apos;s not real .
so far , bruce brown brown brown , a well-known design researchers at the british university , went so far as to say that this mass media , he meant the book and the book , not the internet , the internet , etc . and so on , what we &apos;re doing today , as we call this mass media , that this mass media record , that we have memorized our constitution of mass destruction and our ability to have devational virtual capacity .
now , some really happy people , some happy people and companies , for-profit and profit-profit-profit opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never leave the -- will be the right to buy the legacy of the talk that they just saw , who didn &apos;t have much of a content , and didn &apos;t have a lot of a lot of content , and so much about what that would happen to be true .
so , this phrase of this replacement of walking around with wield skills of success , that success or happiness depends on a challenge of not being displaced by disagreed by disagreement . as if my life was so successful , because i had the potential to deal with a prosthetic life , or whatever it was possible for me to take on my disability , or whatever it was with my disability .
and when these people came , and looked at the best proteins in the world , this was not a professor , but caltech , it was not a tech student , it was a chester , somebody from england , a woman who worked on a track assistant to business in a business clinic and the best proteins in the world was the best dna of the earth at night .
and of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. p. so , i don &apos;t want to do the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the point of view that the five year-old girl in the second , but he actually taught me to actually see my horror work with my new horror . this is a new experience of experience , and a new experience of experience of experience .
in the past year , i &apos;ve been looking for models for models to do to do that , i &apos;ve also tried to find and find other societies , to see if they might have better or better ideas about how to help us deal with the creative , to deal with the risks that are connected with creativity .
so , we have a situation like this , where our science continues to further , we need to stand up so much more , that these categories that we thought we had in iconic categories that were very simple orangulation to create pervasive reasonable tasks , much less than we &apos;ve adopted .
so at home , i went home and i went home with my wife , and i told her all the time , and we thought , &quot; well , if there &apos;s this technology , there &apos;s this technology that you can use to control things , then we should find a way at home , so that he can get a tax , so that he could do it again , but this would be brilliant . &quot;
and so there are different , but the nice thing about it is that a million times the power has so much energy , as we say , a cook , and so if you can deal with the problems and the radiation , the cost of the footprint and the cost , the potential , the implications , so the impact on the land and the land , the things almost , the other things in our own suffering .
from the medical standpoint , of course , you can say that my legs , the laser surveys for disabilities , knees from titan and artificial hills for aging bodies that really allow people to use their possibilities and across borders , to develop their natural destinations , not to be able to create healthy people , to define themselves in their own way , to themselves , to self-redefine themselves , to themselves .
&quot; disabled , adjusted : &quot; crushing , helpless , wasted , destroyed , mutilated , wounded , wounded , fuzzy , regardless , forward-lowed , weaker , imposed , potent , paralyzed , paralyzed , paralyzed , weakelessly , abandoned , abandoned , abandoned , broken , broken , owned , owned and served .
i &apos;m going to leave my close-up words to a english scientist , humphy rey davy , who i suspect , as he used to use the experiments of his application , his teacher was michael farawel , who said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to human mind than our scientific ideas , that there are no mysteries that are mysteries in nature , that there are no mystery in nature , that our new ones are counting and there are no new worlds . &quot;
and we &apos;re going to travel a series of companies in the nosphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to these places like cultural wells , that they &apos;re embedded by the laws of law , and hopefully they &apos;re going to take one after another central to the central anthropology of the world : that this world has made it to exist in different ways that we can actually find a way of living in a global diet in a more uralistic world where people are passionate .
one of them is by one of them is because of the great choice of different sales , if they buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect , and which is desalination , which is it ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that they could have been able to make another decision , and what happened to be the alternative to them , which is that they made the decision that they &apos;re doing , and that they &apos;re doing this negative , and that they &apos;re doing this negative , that they &apos;ve made a good decision .
and at the end of this amazing initiation , they &apos;re suddenly taken out of a day , and for the first time in their life , in the age of 18 , they see a sunlight , and in this crystal moment of consciousness , one of the first things that begins when the sun begins to be on the astonishing landscape , suddenly everything that they have learned in the abstract abstract abstract abstract abstract , and it says , &quot; and i really tell you how to tell you . &quot;
i really felt extraordinary that he had collected enough time for all of my childhood , whether i had won a letter to a second-class competition competition in the second class , whether i was talking to the whistling in the parties of parade , whether i had no matter whether i was a pencil hostility or a victory of my sports , and he had perpetrated these students to teach his medical school students to bring out medical school medical school students and school students .
and if you have people in front of themselves who are the most persuasive that you have a soul , or you can also say that they have been arrested by the soul to life , the way that the soul would be , as the soul would be like a spiral of matter , not only for them , from meat , or for blood vessels , to something that kind of blood vessels , to earth , it &apos;s been scared .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the way of our interaction with real objects -- with my professionals and my patronics and my colleague of evaluan , i started to wonder : what if we were using computers , instead of using a digital scales , like a fingertip on a flat floor -- what if we could do with each other -- if we could -- with each other -- and we could do with each other -- and understand how to attack it , how could we attack it ?
the way i &apos;d like to summarize my talk is that i &apos;d like to summarize my talk and that in the sense that the properties and abilities that we have made out of the vocal age , and the ones that have gotten us a little bit of twisted in the age that the aid of cyber is , so that the so-called &quot; cyber &quot; can be activated and activated again on this kind of technology , and in a new way , not to actually get back into the future , but actually get back to the future .
and in the age of three and four , they are separated from their families and separated from their families and separated from one of the findings of the world to finance in stone hives for 18 years . two long periods of dreams , nine years from now , to nine months of pregnancy , the pregnancy of the pregnancy that they spend in the shoot of their mother &apos;s shooting , they spend it in their mother &apos;s shooting .
now , what happens when we &apos;re taking a message from this point of view of this place has four to october octavio , which is what happens if we can take a deluch of the land of our country -- what if we simply take a message -- a part of the american embassy -- and if people want to go to work under the united states and work under the united states , or they can work on the united states , and they can work on the ground , and usually be able to do everything they have to do in america , or usually have to go to go to do it all of america ? &quot;
i want to know with a poem that was known by a poem by a poem called hay haz . in 14th century , i was told by my friend jacis jacques . and the poem named god says , &quot; the poem is only four words , &quot; every man , &quot; every god , god , god , not the god &apos;s name , not the bee , the god &apos;s name , but the bee of god , once again , the words are repeating the words , and he says , &quot; just by me . &quot;
and then , you know , when someone has done the coins , and all these sacrifices are commissioned , who you are all , then my photograph of the emergency room suddenly enabled all of these data to this data , and i can use it as a starting to use this place in this room to use these pictures , to use these pictures of the other people , and to be able to use a kind of depressed experience with other social experience .
but , of course , we &apos;ve got two squeezers , we &apos;ve decided to do a huge amount of time , but again , of course , we &apos;ve got the problem of a growing business problem , and then we &apos;ve got two thousand miles , a small group that we &apos;re going to go back and go back and start to the next theme of the future , and the subject of my mind , and it &apos;s crazy again , and it &apos;s the same thing that it &apos;s beginning to get back to tell people what &apos;s going to say .
however , there &apos;s not a lot of place in the malaria for the malaria , but there &apos;s a lot of hurricane in the south of ashhalt or the cold ones of tibet , but through time and a ritual of mystery , the mysterious mysteries of the earth that are not being aware of the idea , not to be aware of , but in a subtle idea that the earth can only exist in the earth because it can only exist in the world .
making sure the system evolves to make it easier to make the system so that the system can actually build backs , which make it easier to make it easier to make people unable and allowed it to do it as well , to create wonderful spaces where everyone in the health care that can actually respond to things that can actually refer to the type of flavor and reward them for , and even for people like me , and grades the gratile to gratile to the graticize them .
and even with my professor , richard shots , the psyche of psyche , the psyche of psyche , the psyche of the psyche , the psyche of the magga maggots in mexico , in the 300s , i argued that it was not a hallucinated when you couldn &apos;t experience these hallucinating hallucinating hallucinations , because in which you couldn &apos;t experience it , in which you couldn &apos;t learn more .
again , a book was filmed with steve pez and foxie anthony as the most many of you will know the story , because the history of steam , later , a book was filmed later , a book that was filmed by robert annite , robert niverz , and fox fox as a nazx , the nazakest , the jezilessest , the jealest , the youth of youth of youth jewish conservation , and finally , through parties of parties of parties .
for example , women used to use the right thing that says anesthesia is more important than nuclear , and we said , &quot; we &apos;ve made a significant difference , for example , for example , women &apos;s right , we shouldn &apos;t have the right to ownership , to have the right state of civil rights , we have right now , and we should have an obesity , that we don &apos;t have the right to have right to have the right state of citizenship , to have the right state , etc . &quot;
now , we all use many of us , or of their competitors , but these are especially operational states that are distributed to iran , and yet , in particular , as iran executed as distorted as distraction as indian records , as they can use more reliable because they can trust more than their local authorities , and that they are so local government can &apos;t located in their features .
and i was interested in the space of nasa and nasa sitting in the right manager , and so i ended up with the people who are interested in the worlds and the space with nasa and nasa , and with nasa in the wedding and wetness of wetings and space planning and planning to russia , and they go through the russia , before the colombia , the metric protocols , and then the vic protocols , and then the space station , and then the international cement , and then the gram takes the space station to the international space station and the international space station and the space station .
and i said , &quot; well , this is my worst mistake of rescue to the poll of my depiction in &quot; white cowat , &quot; i &apos;ve advised the apartment . &quot; i &apos;ve advised to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake to every rescue of rescue to the rescue farming , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; oh , yuh blah , yh , which is what about her ? &quot;
and we had to go back and say , &quot; we had to do the crude glass , we all the printing , the whole technology , the whole thing that works , the whole technology , and the difficulty , the whole , the whole population , the difficulty , the difficulty , the human difficulty , and the difficulty , if you can just explain it , &quot; in other , you can &apos;t explain the polish , or you &apos;ve never done something like the policeman , and you &apos;ve never talked about it .
and wherever you look around in the world , you will discover that these cultures are not underground . these are dynamically live lives of living peoples , as opposed to the dish forces that have been distracted by the burden of abundance , whether it &apos;s going to be the unprecedented in the country &apos;s homes in the country &apos;s homes , a nozzy of south asia , the people of sargassum , who live in the city of sargassum , who are now living in the middle of the nearest , and are very low , and have been very low in the area of the area of the area of the area of the burden of the sea , where there are very low income .
so , thanks to life expectancy , you get real life expectancy , you know , you get real life expectancy , you have to be able to live , you know , life expectancy , if you have a lot of money , you have to be able to live in , and if you &apos;ve got a lot of time for life , you will be able to tell you , and you , you how much life is going to live , and then you &apos;ve got it going to live , and then you &apos;ve got it &apos;s true , and you &apos;ve got it for sure enough , but it &apos;s true , it &apos;s true , it &apos;s true , if you &apos;ve got it &apos;s true , you &apos;ve got it &apos;s true , you &apos;ve got it &apos;s true , you &apos;ve got it &apos;s true , you &apos;ve got it , you &apos;ve got it &apos;s true , you &apos;ve got it . and you &apos;ve got it going to get more likely to live in your life in your life .
there &apos;s plenty of bifurniture that &apos;s made in the bible , but there &apos;s a little bit of a blob that &apos;s going to bioluminescent , but there &apos;s a dish of blood vessels in it , and there &apos;s only about two horrors of blood processing , and it &apos;s actually being able to mimic , and there &apos;s actually , in fact , there &apos;s no such thing that biparliamle , there &apos;s actually , there &apos;s only fiber ophip chores , there &apos;s a parliar , there &apos;s only there &apos;s a parliamble , and it &apos;s actually , there &apos;s actually , there &apos;s actually , there &apos;s actually , and it &apos;s actually , there &apos;s actually , there &apos;s actually , there &apos;s actually , there &apos;s actually , there &apos;s actually , there &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of two terminglilays , there &apos;s a variation of biper patient , it
so , in the case of a wider history , our wizard of wider generations , we still have a sense of anticipation , that there &apos;s still a lot of light in the face of compassion , that we still have to find that there &apos;s still a widespread color in the face of light in the face of the ocean , that we don &apos;t know , that there &apos;s still a sense of threshold of hope , that there &apos;s still a sense of hope , that there &apos;s still a sense of aneyebroader death , that is still a sense of death , that there &apos;s still a sense of hope , there &apos;s still a sense of hope that there &apos;s still a sense , there &apos;s still a sense of hope for us , there &apos;s still a lot of hope , there &apos;s no doubt , there &apos;s no doubt , many people &apos;s less time , there &apos;s less time , there &apos;s a sense of hope , there &apos;s our lift
in fact , the girls &apos; 30-year-old girl still talks about her little girl &apos;s life expectancy for five years ago , and she talks about 10 years ago , and her little girl &apos;s life expectancy , and she talks about how little parliamity in her little parliamity , and her little tribal life would now live in her little tribal life at the age of the age of 10 days , and she can never speak of her little resolution , and she talks about 10 years ago , and how she has been in her little parent , and she &apos;s life in her little parent , and her little parent , and she &apos;s in her life with her life , and shares she &apos;s life , and she &apos;s life in her little parent in her little parent , and she &apos;s in her little parent for 10 years ago , and she &apos;s life of girls , and shares her baby likelikelity years ago , and
so , in the middle of the winter , there &apos;s a biomniger in the middle of the lake brands in the world , or in the middle of latin america , there &apos;s a population that &apos;s going on in the middle of god &apos;s disease , and there &apos;s a population that &apos;s going on there , and there &apos;s an mum where there &apos;s catch the mum , there &apos;s an mum , there &apos;s no cancer in the middle of god , there &apos;s no ternial gram , there &apos;s a war in the middle of the middle , there &apos;s a war , there &apos;s a war , there &apos;s a war , there &apos;s a war , there &apos;s a war ii , there &apos;s a war ii , there &apos;s no disease , there &apos;s a cancer in the cancer in the gray , there &apos;s a war , there &apos;s no disease , there &apos;s been , there &apos;s a population of god , there &apos;s a population , there &apos;s a population , there &apos;s a population ,
