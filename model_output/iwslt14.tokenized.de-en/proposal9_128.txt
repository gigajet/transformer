thank you .
seattle ...
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s singing .
but it goes .
don &apos;t find it .
yeah , hello .
we love innovation .
solar &apos;s ...
that &apos;s not ...
we were poor .
are they all ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
after a week .
great trick ?
we were .
a few less .
and he says ...
we know that .
ta-dah !
hold on twice .
here it is .
that &apos;s going fast .
they need time .
music as a language .
that &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... not yet .
thank you .
what a fish .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
that &apos;s efficient .
wonderful , hey ?
completely inefficient .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much .
silly them .
the only chance .
no hospital .
thank you very much .
stephen watts .
three out of 10 .
that was incredible .
thank you . thank you .
yeah , it &apos;s like that .
it &apos;s terrible .
long , yeah .
fantastic , right ?
the sun is going on .
oh my god .
we love entertainment .
we &apos;re going down .
where ?
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we lose them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
a whole bunch of things .
does that sound good ?
the whole environmental debate .
sounds familiar with what ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
that &apos;s great .
that was fascinating .
can i be honest ?
the farm is incredible .
what did they do ?
robert gupta .
that &apos;s the system .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
yes , good day .
lento , slowly .
that &apos;s all i &apos;m interested in .
we can do that .
what do you say ?
not very sustainable .
yes , milliseconds .
this is our present .
they have similar principles .
yes , good day .
good job ! yeah !
just make your job .
this was the result .
thank you very much .
and she did .
so they meet al .
it &apos;s essential .
they &apos;re all important .
very different term .
that &apos;s not exciting .
this is actually me .
it &apos;s lek .
yeah , that &apos;s what goes on .
flying cats .
this is the last one .
can we change it ?
these days are over .
these guys make money .
what &apos;s happening here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
rented them again .
and that &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know .
centers have been built .
what &apos;s happening here ?
but do you know what ?
what was the result ?
i was amazed .
it &apos;s generic .
so they knew everything .
you could see manhattan .
here &apos;s the video .
it has sensors .
why not live longer ?
he opens the door .
a few more .
that &apos;s very good .
oh , that &apos;s the one .
there &apos;s no normal .
yeah , i know .
pretty good , not ?
but do you know what ?
i have a question .
okay . thank you .
i stood up to him .
players don &apos;t sit around .
so they can do that .
they &apos;re bad . &quot;
so let &apos;s see .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
what do these people need ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i thought about it .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
they use their hands .
so how does this work ?
how interested they are .
that would have been okay .
what are media today ?
you can go in .
so where do we go ?
so it &apos;s true .
how do we know that ?
because do you know what ?
it &apos;s not a country .
why do we do that ?
not very often .
bg : thank you .
this is a wish .
and i was an artist .
we call him don &apos;t call him .
not guilt .
and the one needs to be back .
we can do it differently .
they even do hurt .
and i understand that .
a tremendous challenge .
there &apos;s no food .
it &apos;s against justice .
but the wrong things .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
i &apos;m a writer .
here &apos;s another example .
i &apos;m treating children .
it feels great .
i swear it .
i wonder .
he &apos;s not going to do that .
thank you very much for listening .
why should we do that ?
thank you .
here &apos;s an example .
you see it immediately .
not toxic in .
but i continued to work .
or before bombs .
i &apos;m going in here .
there are two possibilities .
we need energy miracle .
why does this happen at all ?
oh . a moment .
i want to tell you .
what do you want to do ?
this is what happens to us today .
and i worked on .
so she was back .
and so it was .
yes , here it is .
i agree with them completely .
and why is that ?
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what would all be done ?
i mean the soul .
you compare the same thing .
in china , it was different .
fortunately not , yes ?
that &apos;s not a protection .
give me pee a chance .
does anybody see anything ?
and i always had .
very expensive mobilizes .
people were crazy .
what creates the illusion ?
my gut feeling again .
after just a trip there .
first of all , constraints .
i created one .
yeah . all right .
put the camera out .
jk : both .
but it gets worse .
so here you see it .
thank you very much .
be a mentor .
maybe 10 times .
but it didn &apos;t .
the data came in .
this is a great question .
i will never forget it .
it has billions of them .
did you see these guys ?
but there &apos;s something else .
here &apos;s another example .
is it photography at all ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
ohhhh .
and then it became international .
there were remixes .
let me summarize .
okay , a few more .
the answer is no .
just keep on . much fun .
my name is amit .
he had the experience .
it keeps you fresh .
this is a great question .
is that your opinion ?
a nearly identical structure .
and it got better .
that &apos;s what they did .
it really enjoyed him .
here you see the city .
good afternoon , everybody .
am i going to like color ?
ooh , thank you .
some have come and gone .
i don &apos;t think so .
dk : 60,000 .
there &apos;s an old study .
not terrified .
the game is from 2007 .
that &apos;s not true of emotions .
he &apos;s called paul open .
what did you believe ?
who &apos;s going to make it safe ?
first , we have the population .
i don &apos;t like that question .
but what do your fish eat ?
we also call him don &apos;t call him .
this is very much .
the work of the interpreted .
but where are we useful ?
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
how do we actually work people ?
his own story .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
so , what does that mean ?
now , what does that mean ?
privacy needs to be .
there are online criminals .
we have three main groups .
they were still fish .
he always showed up here .
and then it happened again .
i felt really good .
and a lot of people forget this .
crisis . death .
it would be intolerable .
it &apos;s not our fight .
it &apos;s not our problem .
we lost the contact .
why not think about it ?
we love technology and creativity .
it would be knowledge .
we continued each other all the time .
and this opens up a map .
but what do we do with it ?
that &apos;s what it &apos;s like .
what do i look at ?
his name is tempt .
is it going to have my size ?
that sounds crazy , right ?
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
we need to spread the message .
most of you know this .
you also have to understand that .
that &apos;s what you see down there .
i want to ask you something .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was destroyed on the floor .
they look like this .
is it all about light ?
i grew up in india .
that &apos;s the shortage .
you see the water coming in .
i had a good life .
so what happened years after this ?
who are these relatives ?
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
these changes are coming in .
how about fitness ?
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
but the key thing is ...
it works like this .
and then they put it up .
what &apos;s actually happening there ?
the orange tractor .
they really loved it .
but i felt worse .
the two of them called me .
mastery technology .
very fearless .
what &apos;s the soul ?
we don &apos;t produce more self .
i can claim everything .
he went up and down .
what else can we do ?
this is what the chart looked like .
now i come to the end .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
it might sound like a good thing .
we were forced people .
so that &apos;s too many .
you can &apos;t have bones .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
or is it possible ?
conflicts emerge creativity .
so what do we need to do ?
they didn &apos;t have books .
this is felix .
i actually made two mistakes .
thank you for your attention .
that was the beginning of the journey .
i &apos;m honored .
and then everybody went down .
they saw the big impact .
first , second , second .
well , i was the next one .
let &apos;s face it -- who &apos;s normal ?
and finally , episode .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
the same thing , only bigger .
who is most successful ?
you want to feed the world ?
i wanted to support them .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
i only loved two .
one place is south korea .
again , you have it again .
this is a natural thing .
my wife told me .
and how did that feel ?
that &apos;s what you can train .
does it make the curiosity ?
so it &apos;s circle .
so , why hacking ?
this happened to be christmas .
what &apos;s the thing for a thing ?
that &apos;s how you know .
you could have done it better .
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
i don &apos;t have to worry .
and that &apos;s not anything yet .
is that sensible ?
so that &apos;s the good news .
it was a huge success .
so they saw something magical .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
2,5 to one , great .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
but no problem can be a problem .
they &apos;re always saying , why ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
it was just not invented yet .
faction should work still .
anybody know what that is ?
for example , this perception in the context .
this is a game outside .
this is god , you know ?
but it was very sad .
so let me remind you .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
and it &apos;s the crux .
sometimes i push too much .
but they do not get the job .
they &apos;re connected to those two people .
her mother moved her alone .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
think of your own decisions .
this picture is from this place .
i see this plunge sign .
and it took 18 months .
tell me about this world .
this is very risky .
and that worked very well .
again , he showed him four .
i learned everything .
and there are hundreds of them .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there &apos;s good news .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
that really made me sad .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
but it &apos;s not that fast .
how can we help you ? &quot;
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
no was never been a way .
the story is not over .
what happened that day ?
well , we want to do it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
so they feel good . &quot;
they come from the artists .
i should not say that .
the power can explode .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
she did it for three years .
you can have this cloud .
the data wasn &apos;t available before .
game is not silly .
now , how could this happen ?
is this all just an education ?
how many people would vote creativity ?
so , we can do that too .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
game doesn &apos;t just mean child games .
and that was 19 years ago .
what would you like most ?
they create an episode story .
they have so much uncertainty .
the data goes on and on .
nobody ever said that .
so paul is a terrorist .
and he actually says that .
don &apos;t take anything than anything .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what should our testimony look like ?
this is a lot of volume .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
i &apos;m almost never going to do it .
she was back and die .
and of course , that &apos;s incredible .
and here &apos;s the picture again .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
a autistic student .
if at the moment , the trash is .
so not like detox .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re taking .
we depend on two countries .
everybody needs a gold glass of fish .
let &apos;s be his . &quot;
people were still happy .
it was my first sunny .
in fact , he collected fish .
my name is brian goldman .
they share their experiences with others .
the white lines are standing for population .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
he showed up on the algae .
that &apos;s just not technological .
there are four and a half thousand people .
and already they have a problem .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
every waste is nutrient .
and so we &apos;re too many .
so the question is : how ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and it was an incredible experience .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
but there are two problems .
i started feeling better .
but , you know what ?
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
that was grandio .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
we &apos;re in an area .
and that &apos;s what we did .
basically they do the same thing .
this is one of the images .
what other brands do ?
and then something weird happened .
you can play with different kinds of play .
the whole building was out of water .
italy wins . yeah .
the morning , before the game .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
the creativity had to go out like that .
today , everything is easy to have .
the nurse asked the nurse .
i should probably not do that .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
and it starts with a doctor .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
we use the energy of the sun .
this is all the metadata .
because i can claim everything .
it will always be similar .
slowly , it certainly moved .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
what are they trying to do ? &quot;
we &apos;re not going to go beyond that .
what lessons have we learned ?
and the shape plays a role .
you can &apos;t store energy .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
okay , that really makes courage .
once we started a vivid .
my second mistake was worse .
and she &apos;s going to see a 257 .
we all love baseball , right ?
somehow , kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
that &apos;s about five meters long .
they &apos;re going to free computers in the free .
because did anybody mask here ?
and then he realizes him .
and then other things shouldn &apos;t suffer .
this one has the largest impact .
the movement , to write it .
anyway , not to navigate .
and that &apos;s all in the beginning .
the truth is more like this .
do you want jeans to solve them ?
you can &apos;t do anything from anything .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
her family gathered together .
thank you very much for your patience .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
what else is risky ?
just be you who you are .
i remember my first fire .
what about a story ?
dark . dark .
i was trying to do something exciting .
but really , really effective , right ?
but we need the whole thing .
nuclear missions , yes ?
this is completely insult .
let &apos;s be quiet .
hmmm , my brand ?
that &apos;s scary .
that sounds frightening .
next : nuclear energy .
also a very exciting phenomenon .
i wanted to be normal at the time .
this is what i &apos;m going to show you now .
as soon as the judge saw me .
we can &apos;t just do that .
so i went to the court .
i got a fear of technology .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
and there are several reasons for this .
they sell certificate .
it &apos;s not going to be documented .
why did i go to medicine ?
it can know where we are .
it spreads itself out .
all adults were aware of the risks .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
i like things that are different .
i went to prison -- hard .
that made no sense in my eyes .
this is a car game , right ?
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
and this video is in real time .
the game starts -- swiss .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
what about longevity ?
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
so the correlation is lower .
so , look at what happens .
it really changed the dynamic .
so i just started playing .
and then we said , okay .
yes , these are the data .
i &apos;m shooting something through the head .
have you ever been discared ?
this is like learning .
because for me , it means memory .
how did he recommend ?
we say in germany .
so you can &apos;t solve that at all .
music is medicine . music changes us .
it turns out it &apos;s really hard .
and you know what i learned ?
these are going to be disgusting .
but what will come to the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
this has nothing to do with science .
and that can make a big difference .
but there &apos;s another reason .
anyway , we need a solution .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
so i listen to that , thank you very much .
they made the channels .
in the presence of maybe two percent .
we started 15 years ago .
how far are you going to get there ?
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
do you know what is neither ?
so the first step in a interpretation .
and it &apos;s still not an interpretation .
that has to be the difference .
if you come to that , yes ?
they can show me , i was there .
that &apos;s the minimum .
we can regain our nutrients .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
on the book and on the image .
this image reminded me of something .
i find them off .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
and what does this mean for the designers ?
i want to prove that to you .
it was a pretty fortune project .
here he leaves the sun .
this is the memory .
these rivers are taking a raw .
a has these benefits and risks .
our magazines are read by millions .
lego made it possible for everyone .
privacy is not the debate .
they were genetically expressed .
i &apos;m the new doctor .
i don &apos;t take the same course .
baseball is full of great statistics .
because we live on a planet of water .
do we really want to go to this direction ?
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
and these are the neural structures .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
oh , my time is over ?
something came to me .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
so we measured his movement .
this is a picture of the object .
apparently it was pretty popular .
you see something fun here .
i really like to like beautiful clothing .
he can only use his eyes .
but the truth is far away .
you can do that all the time .
so this crazy story could be true .
who would ever be ever wish ?
the dutch would have been easy to do .
her father died shortly .
for a year we didn &apos;t have a cents .
we have to increase the complexity .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
here &apos;s her marrow cave .
it &apos;s going to encourage the experience .
but then they really want to go deep .
you want to oriented in the museum ?
that was more concrete .
okay , you really want to know that ?
and i had to go out of the city .
we won some prizes .
who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
it makes light in children .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
no , i mean really serious .
i hold the knife in my hand .
and the goal is very simple .
i shoot my sleeve back .
architects and engineers , the happiness .
we have something that doesn &apos;t rise .
now i see greg moon .
a billion people are going to starve today .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
i fell in love with this fish .
no , no , that &apos;s not going .
and this sounds very different from before .
he was already about sixth .
i started an institute .
they even get funded funding .
the film hasn &apos;t yet been trained .
we need to think about what brands are .
what do you do with it ? &quot;
i call this the bright ticket .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 .
it &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
this is ideology , not science .
and that brought me to each other ...
today 6.8 billion people live .
very simple , so it will come .
it turns out to be busy .
they &apos;re called projectors today .
automatically he goes to the right thought .
that &apos;s how nature presents things .
but it requires a lot of planning .
we can reinvent everything else .
as we think of north .
and it depends on phosphorus .
often in the third , again , forget .
it &apos;s longer than those other two networks .
the stones are color .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
it &apos;s about changing values .
i started with my usual talk .
this is a very sensitive question .
i learned this from my grandmother .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
we haven &apos;t written these app .
and every morning i jump on this .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
the gecko gets very good .
what would you describe ?
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
there are worlds as well .
to ask , what is the right thing ?
people are talking about the urine .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes .
the living bears the spirits .
they gave their blood pressure up .
thank you , but the best part is coming .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
happy productivity . fantastic !
the result of that was catastrophic .
and everyone in this room has to go in .
here &apos;s the olive oil .
bjn sundin .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
risk is not a simple game .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
we have a lot of procedure .
this is maybe opening up .
my brother started staring at me .
these are the apple saras .
i talked a lot about magic .
who could have looked at it all ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who do you actually want to inform with it ?
completely targeted to a certain target .
what do you think happens next ?
they have them . they always have .
so this is a tough foot .
it &apos;s constantly distorted .
they literally moved the lever .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll show me .
most of all , when he died .
so it creates two circles .
the byproduct is clean water .
that sounds initially unusual .
we built unique elements here .
you always lose rare animals .
it &apos;s becoming deeply touched .
he died , broken through the story .
here you can see how the building works .
they drilled each other .
tell them what they feel .
the other one had startled .
let &apos;s make a little footprint .
here you have this little mechanism .
that &apos;s where it &apos;s melted .
the interest is interested in fire .
the question is , what &apos;s coming now ?
students are divided into grades .
these things are logically correct .
and here &apos;s what you &apos;re feeling .
so , for energy , this fell me here .
i tried to understand them .
all of these generations need just a few milliseconds .
and no one seems to raise rain .
that i wrote these crazy things .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
this is just a little less destruction .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t allow the curiosity .
this is also a paradigm shift .
a dalmaink , right .
you can see from the back to the front .
so , from modern to society .
and that &apos;s what they do .
we need to come far , and quickly .
it &apos;s about a new supply of america .
they &apos;re all unlocked questions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they &apos;re the hot countries of somebody .
we &apos;re running through initiation rituals .
now look at this curve .
widespread belongs to our lives .
i meet people in death row .
they were inspired to be inspired by us .
leaders maybe some mutations .
so scott gets this fruit .
we worked up until late at night .
so i followed my gut feeling .
he moved back to the silence .
now we saw the reverse effect .
polite everybody applauds .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
so ... so , not so optimistic .
he shut down the cracks .
let &apos;s start with the truck .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
they had a concept of blue blood .
i believed that everybody could do that .
i never met him personally .
even cats look at this video .
there was jimmy kimmy .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
how would you describe your brand ?
we talk about kitchen , fry .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
no , that was what i thought .
i &apos;m a redundant person .
that &apos;s not the route .
this is a painting of a circle .
the roof was also covered with water .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
and women argued that successfully .
we can support them to be good .
look at what she does .
the main man hit me .
sexual reproduction goes into the picture .
i read them the entry .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
that &apos;s the truth . i believe it .
we &apos;re talking about twins .
it was really deeply profound .
he was shaking his head , no .
this is going to happen next april .
we also got very accurate data .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
the mechanism is from the gap .
but with the right design , please .
we can support them to be good .
by the way , what is information ?
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
there was never before a time like this .
and even lomg thinks about it .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what do they do ?
also , these conversations are interruptions .
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
this is an ecological network .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
the chef had burned him .
you put it like this .
this is such a tragic piece .
that &apos;s what &apos;s just been represented .
what does five milliseconds do ?
i see the dalmaink .
it might be , until it &apos;s invited .
maybe you need to look back again .
no , no , far away .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
156 nations send our television channel .
they tap their internet connection .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
she was not drowned yet .
i &apos;m a human being . i do mistakes .
this is the system that we live in .
but i kept asking these questions .
and that was what i felt .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
you should also want the wishes .
something very strange happened here .
and that was the outbreak of the day .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
it can know how we hold it .
so it creates a feedback .
boston didn &apos;t just have a call center .
this is a humble little app .
the ufer is from one other place .
&quot; they didn &apos;t let them go . &quot;
i lived in parallel worlds .
somebody made an ancient version of it .
and i want to read you the precautions .
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
you can be logical and intuitive .
tell me a little bit about this part .
make it possible -- all of you .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
does anybody even know what that is ?
so this is the reason for this project .
it &apos;s called &quot; i jumped with me . &quot;
let me tell you a little bit about it .
in fact , these kinds of things don &apos;t exist .
we &apos;re going to come back to these people .
we can give ourselves something like this .
so the first exciting pride .
and there are some collaborative staff .
daniel kaneman : sure .
everyone would like to make people happier .
also the dose plays a role .
and why ? intelligent food changed .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
we have masses now in this country .
not even the truth will free it .
because now you can apply a three-sentence .
you &apos;re looking at the timeline .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
thank you , danny kahman .
we get an absolutely flat line .
what does this look like here ? pretty good .
because we don &apos;t want to push around ?
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t have that much .
they lead the process , they understand it .
there &apos;s a lot of things that need to come together .
and then what do you do with the trash ?
bad ? i was completely confused .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and then he can walk away .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
his personal mailing versions of the erosion .
i &apos;m trying to do this for a moment .
it &apos;s got to work only as a present .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
this is a year of water flow .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
so little-open source is open .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
they grow five inches .
maybe i did it with good reason .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
now let &apos;s get another one out of it .
it &apos;s all coming out of our own pockets .
normal people are not accessible . &quot;
as an artist , i think , is very important .
here you see roberto dance .
and no matter italy won the end of it .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
but the game is a format .
thank you . i have a question to you .
he had 20 minutes of glorious music .
well , then i &apos;m going to show you .
that &apos;s just an insurance method .
it should include the two elements .
shake the environment , take less waste .
but i &apos;ll talk about it again .
yes . it doesn &apos;t do anything else than it does .
the goal of all film is transparency .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it was a zacbarvert .
what you need is a new medical culture .
alone , damage and support without support .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
i think our identity is threatened .
many of my climates are very young .
my cousins around everywhere .
we saw some fantastic representations .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
here are two different jewels .
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i put it on my laptop here . &quot;
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
a whole cool piece of cool food .
the difference is then perceived as loss .
in two hours , they &apos;re building up everywhere .
the emergency room drops all the strands .
no insurance can self-assemble .
there &apos;s a lot of great books on this topic .
now , this was a problem for supercomputers .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
you can predict that . why is that ?
what on earth do i do ?
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
isn &apos;t half a quarter ? &quot;
so what can we conclude from all of this ?
so basically a translation of translation .
no tree is carbon neutral .
and on the other hand , you see it always .
the next step was now in this communities .
he had uploaded lots of natural videos .
this is actually just the employment .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
thank you very much , which was incredibly incredible .
so , he &apos;s here . right here .
that really solves the fuel problem .
and ecologist was a catastrophe .
this is one , part of her .
it just didn &apos;t matter , you know ?
in others -- the world of communication .
this is my supermarket . no big deal .
but western governments are also helping themselves .
sleep shortcut is ubiquitous .
i &apos;m going to be tired of how we all do .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
if you burn coal , no .
say , there &apos;s no prediction .
can you play me now in blue ?
no , we find out what &apos;s inside .
and there &apos;s a central point there .
you know , everyone &apos;s eaten .
so it &apos;s more like the norm .
what &apos;s actually archaic models now ?
and the list is to continue endlessly .
so , that was my primate motivation .
supply america . find more .
and the problem is not technology .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we asked around , and nobody knew it .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
monday : color is something full .
it &apos;s got us kind of sales .
and then it looks like this .
do you remember the winds still ?
so , help me make a little bit like this .
imagine mozart .
i &apos;m happy to be there .
the water numbers have increased .
they &apos;re worrying about the bad thing .
man 3 : i &apos;m the museum of museum .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a lip .
in between the instruments have been evolving .
i want to explain a little bit about that .
in fact , it didn &apos;t want to make any viral video .
in this triple , three sentences come in front of you .
you know , three phrase , you know it from school .
you can zoom in very easily and zoom out .
now i add a bass .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
if not , queue today , somebody else will .
this is the machine below geneva .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
they laughed more than they did .
your problem is that you have too little .
third : escalation of expectations .
the official dogma of what ?
they only listen to and then start speaking .
let me show you how they work .
it &apos;s a game called torture .
i call them the next billion .
we &apos;re thinking about energy scarcity today .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
you &apos;re going around and you &apos;re badly .
you have to spread it as far as possible .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
that means something built in the city .
second time . end of the normal time .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
just imagine that for a moment .
raise your hands . let me see you .
maybe we can see drilling as change .
dumall is not much better .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
and let them start with an example .
you know that science is not a company .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so , that really resonated me .
i tried to preserve the body .
life had not changed since centuries .
but there were so many years about aid .
my grandmother never forgotten me .
my fourth technology : predicting complexity .
the third technology : categorization .
it holds a thousand square miles .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
you &apos;re supposed to tell me something about my brand .
it was something that we knew .
but the reality is unpredictable .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
donnerday : confidence is the key .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
i wanted to restore the health of a disease .
now , when you think about a piece of stuff .
what ? that really made me flip .
we &apos;re rejecting smart food .
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
we forced them . puff .
my parents are 80 on the feroes .
and there &apos;s the salmon problem .
it &apos;s the most powerful human feature .
we talk about &quot; drink in information . &quot;
you can jump directly to a certain output .
you can dive into a certain year .
because that &apos;s the thing about it , right ?
shake the environment needs less energy .
this is called the ear model .
now you see the dalmatiner .
and the two last ones are also here today .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
it &apos;s got to go down here , down to zero .
but i didn &apos;t blow up .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
and over time , they can react to others .
our goal was to just say , okay .
and yes , i &apos;ll go on again .
all of them are composable .
it &apos;s all that &apos;s useful .
this will happen in china in a second .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
anyway , they do it in the same way .
the permanent ice is marked with red .
and if not , dance still will dance .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
seriously -- the decline !
well , this cartoon does some say .
here &apos;s a few on the hampton .
so this is how the supermarket is .
i thought i could integrate .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the three words laugh : remember ?
i remember it was yesterday .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
now , i &apos;m checking the court .
i said , &quot; ok , oma . &quot;
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition .
i work in the solar technology industry .
and let me show you a simple example .
but it has an unexpected twist .
so this made sense , it summarized .
yet we seem to be very pleased with this .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
scott talked about man .
and here &apos;s every piece of very well .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
is it about the details or the colors ?
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
no one has to do ecological ideas .
motors , motors -- four possibilities .
i think maybe i &apos;ve heard more hands .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
eeeeee ! no , thank you .
and this is a millionaire concert .
so at this point , we need digital security systems .
so again , the appropriate really good .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
internality comes in many different forms .
so they sit down ; they save the shoes .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
we &apos;ve been here for 130,000 years .
what we want to do is create the future .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in the real world .
there &apos;s a lot of happy coaching .
let me show you from the nearby .
it &apos;s kind of like a potatoes .
bless . damage .
we got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
they were just like the people in this room .
my grandparents would push this number to 70 .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
we need to use more research for more research .
there &apos;s every footprint .
usually i would take the needle out right now .
there &apos;s somebody sitting in the back who didn &apos;t have any childhood .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
let &apos;s do it as if we had a machine here .
what did you believe with these design students ?
that &apos;s going to be a key element of this tooly .
they live with chemosynthesis .
i was totally excited , you know .
now , i &apos;m going to choose the subject of government .
and every night they fly 240 kilometers back .
every morning you fly 240 kilometers of the farm .
how is the food advertising ? &quot;
natural light then offers smarter .
that &apos;s what nobody did in the world .
picasso answered , they just wait .
we always create new tensions and conflicts .
that the theme of ecology is a global thing .
now i &apos;m going to do something more stuff .
they &apos;re all back on their way back .
and they had to remove what we did .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we just signed down .
but here &apos;s what they should have thought .
so you can &apos;t put them together .
what do you do with certificate ?
this is alfred gonzalez .
there can be a consequence of change .
and this is very important in medical research .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for it .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
then he mapped me into the ear .
the rest of the time , they &apos;re occurring .
i start with some simple examples .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask important questions .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
the question is why people accept that .
and i got back to work .
it &apos;s linked to oxygen and silicon .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
and then i wonder : how could that happen ?
first of all , i thought this would be a game .
storytellers need more and more senses .
and trying to do this again with another generation .
today , a lot of people have given the government .
the next week is coming to the market .
she &apos;s got a button ; she &apos;s out of it .
well , it was friday , it was true .
thanks very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the performance .
the first is a classic , apple .
it &apos;s the way i &apos;d like to be .
these things have a positive impact .
no one wanted to do something to do with the film .
what do you think the answer will be ?
on the left , you see a little boat .
so i think we need to be leaders .
so we have this awful simplistic idea .
so two pairs , every parent .
ladies and gentlemen , their relatives .
it &apos;s the only test of survival and success .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
it was march beyond the imagination .
but the best part is -- in a second .
so every concert is a different concert .
so not saving , quoting , avoiding .
and everything is packed or content .
i could paraphrase my house directly . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
they &apos;re supporting other people from their mistakes .
and i put them on the treatment .
you know how to call a 4000-odd ?
notice two things on this curve .
and i have to say , there was power .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
at 16 , i started illustrating books .
that our contribution to the system is to vote .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
he haven &apos;t come out of other countries .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
i never want to make a difference in life .
so i spoke a few months later at a conference .
this is how they communicate -- this is how they &apos;re running their fingers .
i want to show you something here first .
and of course , it did , but then it clicks .
it was summer , and i had cracks .
why are we doing that ? why are we doing that ?
and they &apos;re not only going to die of masses .
what happened is that we could do that .
they don &apos;t invest in power .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put it on .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
anyway . that &apos;s what i want to do .
technical circles are the same .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for 9 / 11 .
i &apos;ve highlighted it here .
at the beginning of the tribal society through language .
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
so it &apos;s supposed to add out of the outside of people .
we don &apos;t invent identity , we invent them .
it was a lot of los angeles , and i was in the bule .
and i &apos;m going to summarize this for you .
now everyone &apos;s trying to see something from this pattern .
he came to me and hugged me .
all the ones that were so began to share .
but it &apos;s definitely not a optimal situation .
i &apos;m so sorry . do you do it crazy ?
the land on the land would roll it .
so smartphones , a huge theme everywhere .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
we want to do something about the death penalty companies .
there are some interesting developments .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet , you have a realistic level of realization .
so , the theme of the day : financial saving .
in fact , no , this was not the mistake at all .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
and we need to improve much more on this device .
it emerged four and a half years ago in italy .
and i would argue that this is good .
this is a problem that many players have .
the last three of the five i put together .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
memory up , triggered the rest .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
well , what is the brand of marry ?
i want to help you calm down .
both of them are survival , both of them .
as i said , amanda is our elephant .
there were no cancers .
did you take all your vitamins all this morning ?
so that was a highly colored experience .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
all of these windrings are scores to be close .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
the only thing that they had was their head .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
i &apos;m wearing jeans almost all the time .
this is a dead turtle .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
i have something that i want to show you .
how would it be to live longer with good health ?
we don &apos;t want companies to patent companies .
and that &apos;s what i found incredibly exciting .
they have reversed the flow of the water .
so , we can &apos;t do these things at all .
in the countries where people are getting to money .
and what does it look like ?
we understood that the weather is global .
and in that head , the memory was remembering .
you saw it waiting for the news .
this is a completely unsustainable pattern .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
everyone in my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
that means we have to get phosphorus back .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
there seems to be an inconsistency .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
now they understood the benefit of the prototyping .
that &apos;s the u.s. for hundreds of years .
i think first about the curiosity is curiosity .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
these were the first calculations six years ago .
but maybe you can still agree with them .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
not everything is supposed to be composable .
if you fall in love , efficiently ?
and we see that it comes through .
because we don &apos;t feel effective money .
yeah , so what should be biohacking ?
here are some people who test it .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
there are the ones that are much more spatial .
the corporate headquarters are right there .
i thought he would have kidney stones .
and feedback on my doctor .
and we also saw this in mobile phones .
we want to cut the number of crops .
the swiss is othrubber .
the dutch writing was an interesting step .
people seem to think about politics , politics is sexy .
but what happens to &quot; consequence &quot; is different .
i was not familiar with the label .
no apple ever sits like this .
good night , south thylacines . &quot;
now , he &apos;s got a tractor in the scene .
and they also feel their movements and their movements .
if your job is dance , dance .
so we accumulated about 50 of the magnets .
these are footage over a six seconds .
but the dutch is not always that bad thing .
in our own countries , we would never do anything like this .
they become rare because we catch them .
so you don &apos;t often miss the animals .
all of these things are inevitable .
we have access to exponential technology .
i remember if it was yesterday .
and from me , a figure will be in the book .
saying , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
so every pile was a little bit different .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
i put my job on 95 .
so i think the basic facilities are very simple .
i said to my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
we found that it really moves strange .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything to do with the project .
the answer will probably be &quot; no . &quot;
you know , how many people are looking at this tedtalks ?
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
this is something like our fight .
so they can remove the whole movement .
here are the results that we just got .
but how do you do that in practice ?
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
i don &apos;t want to do it by not dying . &quot;
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
that &apos;s the problem i try to solve .
it &apos;s not about how happy lives .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
... also , the dose is playing a role .
probably many of you here know the trick in this room .
yeah , they &apos;re right . we &apos;re going to fix that .
and i &apos;ve got all kinds of little props here .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
well , i understand that . i do that .
the marshmallow needs to be on top .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
think about how we should measure our success .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
these blocks don &apos;t bring us any money .
i can put the sequence during the sequence .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
for nathaniel , music means seelian health .
is great , then we have a business model .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
because actually this person is not interested in prove .
because we can &apos;t live without that lifespan .
he &apos;s just kidding it and not himself .
why do i have to afford this little car ?
a phrase with his own breath .
it &apos;s not spoken about interpretation in the beginnings .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
and in my adolescents , i said expected .
it &apos;s kind of a vaccine system .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
or they didn &apos;t have a photoolic tography .
and this brings us to a big question .
they virtual reality and they don &apos;t have computers .
yes , what do we do now ?
and the world in which we lived like this .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
if you generalize it , this is what happens .
and that was not a difficult diagnosis .
i was a 20 obsessional student .
well , really good , maybe an all-star .
wealth , not debt affects the result .
she had the last word in every family street .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we use this word with these verbs .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and that worked . it worked out for scott .
i met the decision to go to the united states .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
in 2010 , it was viewed by 23 million .
and that was an experience in decourage for me .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
or are they more like a downtown ?
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
so what are we going to see in the film ?
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
i want to tell you how we found that .
and that &apos;s the planning behind the exxon .
i learned that , in a moment , everything is different .
each ice berg has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature &apos;s nature .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
look , dr. kekean has changed his way .
it &apos;s nates , and it &apos;s just nates .
we have the passion of a diy innovator .
this is moore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
we want to create mass incarceration . &quot;
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
now we &apos;re doing this with drilling machines and machines .
this is the site center for service and information .
and we want to put this on a global scale .
we have all the navigation systems in our cars .
but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
all right , let me show you something more of it .
here we were , and this is the painting .
emc : &quot; they &apos;re welcome transparency . &quot;
there was a lot of crazy things going on .
from avian age to the machine age .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same disabled movement .
but will we make the best of our game drive ?
8,000 gamers played the game for eight weeks .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
you would expect extra billion players in the next decade .
but one of them is worse than the other .
but do you know what you don &apos;t have a right ?
i thought we &apos;ll put the pokerry in the same way .
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
and so i met a little unusual decision .
so my two passions were flying .
you do something that is actually a little different .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
i don &apos;t know who you know this image .
i &apos;ll just agree , that &apos;s logical .
i think it appears to be a comparison .
the question of death penalty is an interesting question .
the kid in me is really excited about this .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
today , i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
the underwater part comes from a stone age .
when i say reality , i mean photo reality .
at the moment , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
and how was it successful ? what was it successful ?
a little bit more about you , that &apos;s not you .
it was &quot; forever , forever . &quot;
tuesday : adaptations are completely overwhelmed .
the dog ! i was linguistic .

i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
but the phosphorus is not going to be replaced .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
we wanted to develop a means of language learning .
i might have another 40 years in me .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
if you want to make hyperlinks between the images .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a great loss .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
this is the kind of teaching teachers .
now there &apos;s a whole lot of studies to do .

we see this in all sorts of areas of human life .
and then it was like three months .
it &apos;s right , morality , patents .
the main problem here is as similar to aids .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter about reality .

politics don &apos;t change ; government is change in change .
but what this image is , is a problem .
there are some places that we can apply to .
we called it the digital water .
because they have special skills of processing .
so here are some natural fireflies .
the second factor is the services we use .
it changed my way of making films completely .
it &apos;s hard to reconcile the destruction .
so you could feel comfortable with selling him .

geh and jellyfish cohen .
so they go off and they start to invent them .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .

so we &apos;re going to start with a wind dryer .
he says , &quot; do you want to make up the line . &quot;
imagine a soundtrack of sound .
it &apos;s a totally denial of mistakes .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .

so , climate change becomes terrible for them .
i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times website .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
but the volume is much larger than ever before .
it grows in the winter , and it grows in the summer .
not just bad , but the worst of all times .

we repair them , repair them .
and the world in which we live now looks like this .

child mortality has declined about a tenth .
this is also where it comes back .
maniok is something that is half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .

we walk into the poor of placebo industry .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
where &apos;s the biggest interest in what &apos;s really going on ?
and also , the energy episode is very important for them .
we went back to the titanic of titanic .
because artists have a local relationship to the gap .

here &apos;s the current version of this one .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
and this was sort of the first of people developed toys .
as a result , we &apos;re building more powerful social relationships .
you never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen so flat lines .
i take this hand . and here &apos;s the knife .
and the film is called &quot; the phenomenon of life . &quot;
well , in this field , there are not many thousands of goals .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines .

now we spend three billion hours a week playing online .
the biggest difference between them is around time .
we tried to get the point of automation .
bg : a energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
and i say , &quot; shake you not a self .
with pivot , you can dive into a decade .
but for many people , this is a little bit more radical .
so i used to channel lots of fish in my life .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
in fact , the notes are very vague and unprecedented .
because we don &apos;t make things free .
there &apos;s something more likely to be my glasses .
as i said , two-ending has just started .
this is a interactive filtrate .
and trust ! for you despite that .
i &apos;m still going to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and everybody knew it worked like this , right ?
i would continue to do this work that i love .
and the question is , are they good news or bad news ?
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
here is : &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
the next step was to find the apps for it .
we still know one where all the twin places are .
so you &apos;re just going to google projectors .
what other metamorphobiorphobic have you running through ?
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other budgets .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money looking at great .
this constant feedback is not true in real life .
i &apos;m going to do it for you , and then i &apos;ll explain it .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
a research mester , a research mester of natural design .
i &apos;m also going to resolve what &apos;s in there .
you don &apos;t know anything in this gold glass . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great dunes .
in the future , most crime are going to play online .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
now he &apos;s on the red list of endangered species .
30 years ago , this would have stopped .
but i really think we &apos;re going to do something else .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of this communities .
the cell community began to abstract information again .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital physical .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacine .
&quot; don &apos;t do it as an untrue .
i didn &apos;t know how to use that .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s being put together .
it &apos;s also urban designers and titans who are very interested .
there &apos;s not even him online . there &apos;s no market .
this doesn &apos;t work for memory at all .
our steps in digitization of life were exponentially .
this is star night , probably never seen this before .
in the course of this discovery , i learned a lot .
when i was a kid , i always recorded comic books and so on .
when we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing now .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
we albered only around the world as well .
many talk from 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
i was pretty obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
so when clones say , there &apos;s no soul .
this is the most difficult part of my talk .
i can &apos;t play like this today in 20 years .
both cases , they gave me , they took me .
so much testosterone , but no response to that .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
i &apos;m just going to keep the diameter in my axes .
1m is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
a manhattan project ? how do we come to the target ?
that &apos;s how the weighs to think .
these are spaces that can react to people .
well , how do people die in such a hack ?
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle there .
i sold cane animals all over the country , worldwide .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can rotate that around .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio did not know that .
no , that throw away is exactly the right one , yes ?
many of them are covered by faces .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
in both cases , surgery was operated , and it was going to give them good .
she didn &apos;t have a treatable brain damage .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
and the fish also had the fortune to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the numbers of language .
it was the missing cruise against drugs .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
there &apos;s more to that , there &apos;s still deeper .
but we only know very little about where the things go .
ok , imagine how extreme self-motivating self-motivating .
i know what people think when they see that .
ask the questions , ask the evidence , ask the evidence .
i said , &quot; chickens ? &quot;
everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
it used to happen in the village .
this is what happens to be the genetically engineered machine age .
there &apos;s a political composition in our country .
they sent them to the beatles machine .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental disconnect .
it could take place inside of a magazine .
... the crowdsource of crowdsourcing .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
i &apos;ve been working in a coal mining plant -- dangerous .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
so , there was root he and he said , right ?
that means that go back to the dropout .
so , like a human being comes with certain kinds of things .
and of course , as design does , impact on perception .
for the bottom two billion , but it &apos;s a disaster .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious ambition .
anwalt : i &apos;m a lawyer .
we have an abstract abstract language .
another example is called virtual reality .
but in fact , it was a major part of this night .
we had to worry about the lawyers &apos; forests .
it was called the automatically interior stone .
dotinotar is a certificate .
well , because you don &apos;t know that it was different .
what are they going to consume ? what are they going to be ?
he took a famous photo . how was it ?
it slows down for one of our big problems .
we see the process that self-feed itself .
eighty ? yes . alive ? yclients .
here &apos;s a short video of what we &apos;re doing .
but together , you can make something special like this .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
because the images eat it for them to feel real recommendation .
squeeze , and whums , you &apos;re in this museum .
the idea is to cross a digital security system .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and this is actually a conservative estimation .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain it .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
in fact , the progressing society is progressing energy .
this was not a movie , not a hd , it was real .
i wasn &apos;t there for a long time ago .
because you know , this is a fun process .
have you seen a climateen tree before ?
there is exactly the same thing that i just described .
when you get far away , get together . &quot;
supply america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
frost , the man will be clean every day .
this is a organism that we described in 1996 .
so i &apos;m going to step back , and i &apos;m going to get another way .
i filmed in war places -- difficult and dangerous .
so we should better figure out what the goal is .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
if we &apos;re building cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
in other words , play is our adaptability .
can you imagine something that comes out of taboo ?
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds across their pain .
you can just call some names and people will understand .
diphere , tubes , child paralysis ...
this is a variant thing made .
well , the energy episode is over time .
and it was an experience that couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
it caused immense jew in the control room .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s this kind of cranking cock .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
and that &apos;s how he &apos;s flying his elderly .
and then there &apos;s a lot of simulations of simulations .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the azily years .
because the music is the extension of our body .
he lived only nine-year-olds for three years .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
a baby needs about a sixth of wind .
so i know a couple of things that didn &apos;t have .
that &apos;s a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide around the world .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone from here .
it &apos;s like asking someone to touch the sun .
please follow me , because the circle will be again .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here .
this is an idatic debate . it has to stop .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face it .
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
i have a friend who drives a passenger .
it &apos;s not just a nice noble pete .
and because we get older , the wind gets bigger .
that &apos;s the time period where you fall in love .
and we &apos;re still very , very , very strong of stories .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and the predictions that they read are serious .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change .
it &apos;s my big , life-long love and fascination .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
why do they advertise us if we can &apos;t buy it ?
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
a few years ago , i started to develop livelihood .
the brochure describe it still as untouched .
my grandfather was the prohibition in prison .
she was a pocket , strong woman , she had an impact .
so , in some sense , the technique stops us .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it realistic ?
but what if you want to see the paintings ?
but my logical side didn &apos;t like it either .
i just want to say a little bit about salt rescue .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . heartful wish .
we also brought into design schools .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to address justice .
my uncle died from alcohol diseases .
my grandmother was strong , but she was located .
in fact , we &apos;re a number of root community community .
what is this new condition that takes the world slow down ?
let &apos;s call the animals , it costs a lot of money .
if one neighbor helps the others , we strengthen our communities .
ohhhhh , wwwww !
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing galleries .
50 percent of their decisions were hit within nine minutes or less .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and my talk today is mainly suspended by these cognitive action .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
open the card , jump with a click .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a lot about transparency now .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
you could also use ordinary design -- technology to spread .
one of my friends has made it -- richard bollingles .
imagine this imaging dots could actually start flying .
i like to smile , and i say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
these are the kinds of questions we need to be faced .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
and i can tell you , it was a change .
we need to start changing the real world into a game .
and this is an economist . so he &apos;s logically logically .
i mean , how much do we remind our memories ?
the more money you make is satisfied .
that all of our survival of survival is linked to every single one .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
and yes , i have a task , as you might recognize .
secondly , the same photos should have the same lighting .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
for example , this person would be completely logical .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to be .
i have . the first picture is a picture of my family .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing going on in the movie of statements .
and the film is going to be called &quot; the phenomenon of life . &quot;
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
just that i think it &apos;s more like it , not true .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll be happy . thank you very much .
but it turns out that this isn &apos;t all .
i mean , we wonder : why are we fighting ?
these are many deaths through masses , 20 an hour .
so , there should be better at the beginning of my death penalty .
because they &apos;re the ones who are also experts for taste .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
i mentioned it to miguel , and he got it .
so the brushing of the trees also better the system . &quot;
and then instantly , that &apos;s unfair .
and also , what you would think in the mind today .
and we &apos;re going to replace oil by other energy sources .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t do it .
like algae -- and other fearful things .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
it was completely exclusive that it could fail .
so that really resonated me , and i wanted to do more .
and immediately , i see a different pattern that &apos;s there .
yes , this is what you see down there .
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , it &apos;s efficiency .
we &apos;ve been using ourselves over three years now .
and if possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the strange ames .
i know now that it was the bottom of the ocean .
and that was the first time i learned this .
i studied a woman , and she was in breathtaking .
and all the time i collected more and more knowledge .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 , if a bat hits 300 .
in 2010 , we had just connected under two billion people online in 2010 .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our justice system .
and the illuminating path through the rest of the book .
&quot; because she had been holding her this morning , &quot; he said .
we have the capital of the techno-philanthropy .
this approach is what we &apos;re doing in a new way .
since that time , we &apos;ve been preserving all kinds of recognition .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
now , your life itself won &apos;t become happier .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re always lost .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
here &apos;s a picture of an ordering in kentucky .
he has a feed of 15 to one .
i can say the channel is a man .
we &apos;ve moved forward in the same way called bird age .
this is 20 meters of sea level , like greenland .
this is the audience we just finished recently .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
but if you can , if you &apos;re in a foreign policy .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
and all of a sudden , he seemed no longer human .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
or would you like to be more powerful , more power .
and i don &apos;t mean only less successful , even though that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
my great-grandparents died as they were 60 .
now , where should we go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
that &apos;s the kind of thing that you &apos;re all in the suburbs .
and of course , it can never be more in germany . &quot;
one government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
and the more i talked to , the more i should tell .
and i celebrate , i see a little kid like a little kid .
obviously it &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
if you &apos;re happy , you attract other happy people .
players are in the spheres of social networks .
how can we transfer these feelings from play into reality ?
this is how it became the same , bad team under the best .
the fact is that this uncertainty should worry .
so people have really thought about creativity in the west for a long time .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
one of them was that the phone was never broken .
the first thing we can tell is the structure and the function of function .
a few months earlier , and i had just forgotten everything .
even who kills someone is not just a murder .
for example , the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
and the next interesting phase was about another billion years .
and this video was actually already sent in january .
each of these subjects , of course , are many smaller decisions .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing the time .
today i want to tell you about circles and openings .
they &apos;re interacting with their environment and their experiences .
they can lead their friends and neighbors . thank you .
you know , there was no mandarine in paradise .
yes , i &apos;m very excited to be able to be with you .
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting is the vision of vision .
i apologize to me that i have to get so far away .
secondly , what economists call peropera costs .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
so it has nothing changed , and yet everything has changed .
we just crossed the 7-billion-dollar brand .
then let &apos;s put this analogy in the future .
so , if you can do the lights again .
it was a store called the draeger &apos; s .
are you so far ? you see a little bit nervous .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
the things that are only used to be used in technical systems .
so the device you see there doesn &apos;t work .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
they did it by serving the country .
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
welcome the fear . welcome the risk . welcome the risk .
second , when he &apos;s right , he &apos;s got no soul .
there &apos;s only the second best , just the fire department .
they can shrink them , where they go and stand .
an amazing error . one of nine unguilty .
i want to give you two , maybe three examples of this .
very rarely , you actually become a roller of a rolling iceberg .
this is somebody who &apos;s safe from 10 .
we used to get used to the fact that things happen linear .
i had a 14-year-old poor black boys as a mando .
they &apos;re inside , they want to end up in the end of the gangs .
and then people could eat this , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
because that &apos;s where the ownership of government is happening .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what do you do ? &quot;
and then we started negotiating insulating .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
i play a little bit of what these sounds might have .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re asking you to ask people for a moment .
but also our perception of self , as they deceive us .
and other examples are the ambitious systems , intelligent systems .
how many doors have the house where they live ?
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells even good .
and i think that &apos;s what i feel like , and i feel like we should teach that .
and i guess a lot of you have done this .
some people were disappointed that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
i sent them home without talking to my doctor &apos;s office .
the cost of solar energy was in the last year 50 percent .
we need to join the machine inertia of government .
there &apos;s a direct feedback system for this .
the monuments of software takes place in the rule for a few years .
and sure enough , we can find fast foods .
cats look at cats looking at this video .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
and what happened was that i needed a experts .
it looks pretty much like an old-fashioned language .
i just wish i could see my kids grow up .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
it has sight of life , one after another .
and i talked about funding a expedition .
we &apos;re talking about the flood of information flows .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineer collective .
this is already in the first year half of its advertising .
now how do you start talking about the language of music ?
so they go around and they do art installations like this .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
i was shocked , and i was crushed into the internal .
i went through the emergency room for my way home .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
i say this because i think identity is very important .
because all these new technologies are self-assembling by themselves today .
because her life depended on whether they made the job right .
and these people know something that we lost from the eyes .
i knew she had come to give her a point .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure in something , we do with it .
a typical wal-mart offers you today 100,000 products .
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so what i &apos;m telling you right now is what is truly awesome .
for example , the previous example , it was about finding some details .
he said he didn &apos;t say that . he will ask questions .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought in .
if it wasn &apos;t moving even more , you &apos;ve buried them .
would you not want to make these changes in your genes ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
again , what potential we &apos;d like to call &quot; potential ? &quot;
i &apos;m saying , we &apos;re ready for our own episode game .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , two reasons .
if we looked at how feelings are with variation .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
there was no christmas trees . we did all this .
and we should not do that . our healthcare system is mimic .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
the program that i use here is a little experiment .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
depending on a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals ?
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not so sure .
does it impossible to say how the photograph was actually put together .
the words , as long as his friends , spoken his own .
and we found that in fact there was a context .
do you know how many decisions you make on a typical day ?
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
so the driving force behind is the cybersuperpower .
i didn &apos;t cut two years anymore with my wife &apos;s wife .
the pilot gave the machine to the hudson river .
the epiphany is the death of life .
that keeps us going to be able to do this , and let &apos;s move on .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
it rains about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
you see the person who &apos;s wondering what &apos;s going on inside the inner .
most of my activities , i put two hips on my own .
as it turns out , dna synthesization is very difficult .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we think about our future as an unpredictable memory .
well , the memory itself is a storyteller .
what it ruined was the memories of the experience .
we &apos;re going to meet in the next few days a few days .
there &apos;s a increment-and-a-terror there .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
a fishes , but also a bird reserve .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love story .
the first one that was more like a passionate monkey .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he deceived it .
because music is a language and language is a language to communicate .
and most of all , first of all , is what the right thing is .
but i &apos;m just doing it a little bit more curiously .
i started thinking , i should just invite the project .
we can , of course , first of all , look at the waste .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
just to precisely precise times , they &apos;re overlocked .
when the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
so you can ask : how happy is the living self ?
most of them are completely ignored by memory .
don &apos;t please tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
did a single audience ever see somebody on masses ?
it &apos;s the question of if you can get it to zero .
you can test it for my talk in their rooms .
but , of course , the sum is very , very diverse ideas .
and she asked him , what &apos;s your hobbies ?
so also , in every store , you can get the things back .
so the question is , how do we go with these windmills ?
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
so , for example , protecting the environment , less car .
and life lived in the coast of british columbia .
so , if i put them next to each other , that &apos;s what they &apos;re interested in .
do i look as though i could write a song ?
she said it was like a thunder of air .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious to look at what we need .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
you put a blue on a green one , and you can make light .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
these images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast .
yet , we &apos;re still coming to the galapagos .
more and more people came in , just because they were angry .
it was the fear of terror that shaped their lives .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
we have a lot of cells that are no longer available to themselves .
you make the errors now , and you pay a lot later .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
but where would the next aed to help this patient help ?
you have to make 62 different decisions to design your car completely .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go like that .
almost as if we were preparing our lives for a long time .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego room .
i was the only one who could talk to the aircraft .
so the records were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
think of that as a point of view , as a flying point .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
this is a fascinating adventure that you can do .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the coming years .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
they evaporate their judges . they almost never do it .
usually , most people start to orient themselves to the task .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
if you walk , yes , everybody destroys the floor .
if we overrun it , we can cut a little bit back .
the most powerful mountain workers is the head of massachusetters .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a book .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be worse .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
because by marine protected areas , we &apos;re basically putting the past again .
i want to close with a story that really excites me .
sometimes i lose the equilibrium . a story to end .
i found that technology should make magic and not kill .
so now we have the time-consuming renewables .
so today , evolution can happen in the time period of microseconds .
this is a rare glimpse .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
we could , of course , reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
autocolors , outside of the cars -- i have 56 possibilities .
they &apos;re not even coming out of the museums .
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
i really like your kind , sergey brin . now .
i became the miracle of not dying of this day .
it &apos;s called eyeballs , and you can see the description .
this is the average size of a greenland iceberg .
i mean , what does anybody do with so many outputs ?
and as common term , we can use the word sexual sexuality .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think it &apos;s already .
we all need to believe in the last things that we can &apos;t see .
we call it miguel . in fact , it &apos;s called miguel .
because he doesn &apos;t know where to go from , first .
then the same thing happens in a good conversation .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
we take images of these mini-great-grandchildren all down to detectors .
economists call this a parasite assessment .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what &apos;s going to make us modern progress .
the way to maximize is to maximize choice .
we can shift from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
this is a whole book , an example of non-billboard data .
and of course , we all share the same adaptability .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the fda line .
there are cases of accidents , like the one in faotar .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
innovation , creativity , and development don &apos;t just come out of our heads .
i want to help you with a very specific aspect of curiosity .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
ceos are a little bit through . but here it &apos;s going to be interesting .
because although it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
one of the evidence here , by the way , is that men are not pigs .
this deputy ran over to the older black black .
but i don &apos;t know how eminent people will be .
you &apos;re walking around the block and it &apos;s taking it as a revelation .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back in speed room .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
the first of these are a contradiction of complexity .
they invest a lot of their time in the construction structure of structure .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little will it support .
you &apos;re usually just thinking and some of them are not going to come .
now , he mentioned the mineral needs of physical lankton .
i take the breath of the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
you feel that &apos;s the actual truth behind the exception .
but the question i want to throw up is : why not ?
and the best part of this is perhaps what &apos;s expected to us in health .
this is technology supporters that are there today .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so difficult , so painful .
wr want to help people who were convicted .
and that means free , which means open and productive .
how did he get to look for this particular kind of help ?
let &apos;s jump to the moma , again in new york .
tempt is going to be part of the show , which is pretty tricky .
we &apos;re making androgen , and we &apos;re talking about androgenes .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this is scandals , and we should be ashamed .
and this is the value of this experience , this is so simple practice .
but while you &apos;re talking to different people around the world about these possibilities .
they have a renewable energy consumption of five percent .
and they did it with this so-called lead-maps .
but key is when i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so i was busy doing when of course , or intuitive .
and these are just the biohacker , the individual people .
it means that we &apos;re reaching a cultural impact next to scientific achievements .
this struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
he invited the king of sidewalk to the dinner .
but somehow we &apos;re creating this problem from this problem .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half-year .
but instead of getting into panic , he just stopped .
how about tears that we can &apos;t even predict ?
if you look at people who have them to do it ...
and guess what we found in the attack ?
imagine that every single one of the people is being controlled .
okay , let me take you a little bit of blood for you .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
new investments to create good paying jobs .
six : a social decline . speaker : 65 deaths .
and i hope you &apos;ll be able to play with me like this and play .
what that means is that the player &apos;s sure three of 10 beats .
a long time ago , there was gray whales -- 500 years ago .
in many of you will say , the nuts are crazy ! that &apos;s good .
the x interpretation of a piece is this comparable .
from my eye view , i saw the master &apos;s going up and down .
fireflies in a glass of glass , i always found very exciting .
for example , this picture has about 10 billion points , i think .
so i decided , when i was 15 , i was going to be a diver .
here i am a little larger here . we &apos;re looking at the center .
and within a few years , lego went into every household .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
by the way , i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer .
and i want to show you my outcome for this week .
56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t come from court .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-regret .
i asked him how he became such a fish experts .
there were numerous recovery shaped shadows .
from that time , an anecdote that you might know .
it doesn &apos;t need to sing a love whistle or a whistle .
and six milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that goes back much further back to the cultures in the pre-industrial times .
so , i think it &apos;s a very ungendered hack .
i think that kind of sechsht , or something like that .
this actually took two thousand really long shape , this networks .
finally , one solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
so , this looks like a basketball plaque .
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i didn &apos;t leave it .
well , in fact , the number of nonviolent crime doesn &apos;t change very much .
i &apos;ve eaten it in a restaurant in southern spain .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
it was always as inspiring , so refugee .
the death penalty in america is defined by irritum .
drew the trash on the side . went home .
alone this airport has a surface of 100 square kilometers .
i like things that are queable . i like special things .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
so maybe you should be asked a little bit about this . &quot;
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine machinery .
here you can see a clip from this attacking code .
we &apos;ve got his bed in order to see it out there .
we degrab a man who has value for our society .
we put a games to emerge from the real world .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is , it &apos;s the question .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
this is indeed the forecast of man and machine .
a few . probably about as many creative people there are .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
they produced the highest construction in the lowest time .
it &apos;s about five tons of tons on the planet .
i grew up with a cave portion of science fiction .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building shran , not intensive .
so here was finally a company trying to do it right .
the component is always going to be more to the friend that you live with .
and i &apos;m not sure they really stay iron .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little trip out of it .
and i think one of the things that came from my mind was a very good code .
in fact , nasa showed that there are many of them out there .
they like to increase the paralysis and send the satisfaction .
now , i asked myself , how can i actually get this up ?
it &apos;s an independent area . they &apos;re all controlling mineral .
in contrast , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view of the world .
somebody had broken in and had broken the system .
photos like this : an assembly along a much road road road .
the biggest fear they had pirated , raped and death .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to get into all these extensions .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange street .
but this time , it &apos;s a very good medial opportunity .
i &apos;ve brought seven underpants , and that &apos;s all .
but a lot of people are caught in a very strange position .
our gut is a wonderful forgotten environment for these bacteria .
well , the two species of self are pulling two terms of happiness .
well , life itself lives its continuous lives .
there &apos;s a massive wave of happiness under researchers .
it &apos;s just a bundle calories . it &apos;s mite .
the modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
ah , the majority . i like to see this as a doctor .
my inspiration comes from an event that is 2,500 years behind .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
now , what does this have to do with placebo effect ?
smallpox . the pox have killed billions of people on this planet .
it &apos;s the renewable energy as they are often called .
this is a fish swimming in the southwestern corner of western spain .
so , as i said , how much competing was these diagnosis ?
the notes have the function of the letter of a script .
then these are the interconnectedness of the suburbs of industrial cultures .
that means you &apos;re navigating on sound and rhythm .
so this is just a application of many that you can do with it .
and then we worked in this way a codes of protein .
at the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to lhc .
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
that &apos;s what we call our lab , perceptual design .
54 percent of deaths cut through boxes .
basically , the emphasis had become the building block of our time .
how about a new sentence , never before voted hearing .
how can a judge someone turn into something he &apos;s not ?
in many areas , people had to be scared of lynb .
so , programs that can rotate on the former nuclei .
for example , the fish had been taken on a glacier of glue .
opportunities that were not allowed to be excluded .
so a couple of years ago , i went to do that .
finally , in the process of writing , we should welcome the fear .
an eighth , played marke . how is your brand ?
why is it important to start ? what is the red ?
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free .
and i said , &quot; how are you communicating ? &quot;
well , in this night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
and the critical indicator for this is the extinction of languages .
and i had to explain to the journalists that there &apos;s no test to this test .
and this is called androgene receptor .
we &apos;re going to become a collaborative nature , heart disease .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to look at as a ph.d. .
right now , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
and soon i wrote an article about intelligent food transformation .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
so i offered a $ 10,000 price for the winner .
one day this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
there was no piano of the time when there was no piano .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
even if they were shooting themselves , they would have emissions .
most people know the most people know this from software .
this is actually live in the internet . you can test it .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nunvunveils .
but nothing was invented to let me go again until now .
and the best part is that they connect with magnets .
some of my favorite passive passions have happened over the last five years .
i looked in the rage , and it was a little pink .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular tonight .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
so the dramatic numbers come in at the prisons .
i &apos;ve given some talks to germany over the death penalty .
a child in india says , &quot; today i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
this is my lane lander . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
what is the relationship to the thought and feelings about you ?
and if the dangerous ones are , then really bad things can happen .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
if we did not take any phosphorus and abandon it .
this piece of 50 years old became the magic thing for me .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours per minute are uploaded .
if they could do it for the ones , they could also help me .
and just disappeared all of these companies , one after the other .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned each other as adults .
remember , it &apos;s free , nobody deserves us from it .
so if we do something to the cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
and so , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go to the house .
if you just have one of them , it would be a very different world .
specialized skills and percentage of skills and their combination to success .
people here have contributed to the development of this miracle .
and somehow , we need to make changes that go zero to zero .
we still find other strange things about what their rights are .
this is the current dream of most perceptions that we have .
this is our youngest tags down there on the lower right .
by the end of march , the lhc will be refunctional .
and that &apos;s the message that i took in medical students .
you know how to call a 3,000-pound baseball baseball baseball ?
i think that in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
if somebody lies , he &apos;s not just a liar .
and that &apos;s why i think the ted community should be the ted horse .
and she &apos;s spreading , of course , organs .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say , thank you ted .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
well , finally , the film has a very big momentum .
in fact , this is just a period of two / 2 / two weeks .
these people will be connected to the film in forever -- forever .
so all these green areas , these are the richest environments .
one is called jazz , and the other is called &quot; sassination . &quot;
so unfortunately , we have a piece of god to virtual .
i went to the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
in the short time here , one of them was clear : ted has an identity .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good percentage to actually lead the experiments .
in my opinion , mass incarceration changed our world .
this is all reality today , and it &apos;s going to be much more possible in the future .
so this allows us to play together with bonding and trust and with each other .
here &apos;s what you &apos;re talking about , the more you need , the better .
people said , don &apos;t you have a fear of never succeeding ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding from me , but i can live with it .
and what i learned is that absolutely errors are completely unbelievable .
i love this : &quot; watson does unlock human enemies . &quot;
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very seriously .
three months later , i moved , and the adventure went on .
it &apos;s about making scarce flow overflow .
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gray and stuff like this .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
we want to use this as a possible impulse for the flyglow .
and the question was , how could you connect technology to this ?
for example , i don &apos;t want to give the same rights as a human being .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s concert .
the man should have come from the monkeys or a common ancestor .
loud and quiet signs , f and b , etc .
how were his living circumstances , like society and politics ?
on september 10th , the machine was running for the first time .
we &apos;ve distributed livelian children , and they &apos;re playing with it .
and when i listened to her , she did keen sounds .
and i was good , i finished with claude to laude .
but if i ask you , how about this woman ?
you collect information about the piece in the secondary literature .
there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they can all be engaged .
but how about the image you &apos;re linked to all your images ?
you say you don &apos;t die the names .
but she does something that no other regime technology does .
because the categories tell me how i can put them apart .
so i sat down , and you played the tedtalk .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
we should be able to rotate everything we want .
and i tend to look at my shadow as a shadow .
hence studies have been done to see if that &apos;s the right thing .
and then you can see what kind of tremendous speed there is there .
the natural mice comes out of asia where all of japan comes from japan .
because a good engineer has either built cars or nuclear power plants .
that was the first beginning of a musical printing .
you can only have nuclear missions if you &apos;re not there .
you &apos;re fine . the question is , how is it going to get us ?
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
the officials of all western industrialized societies .
&quot; do you remember the patients that you ran home ? &quot;
we live on a planet that is 70 percent covered with water .
if you just dive the building of apartments against the cities .
that &apos;s how you can just apply those logic .
often the music class is that you learn how to read the notes .
that &apos;s just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
eight : tsunamics warning . 9 / cyberattacks .
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
bruno guisi : mark , mark , come back .
just when it doesn &apos;t seem to be there , maybe the most necessary .
so we don &apos;t have to control the people , we don &apos;t have to be too bad .
now , there &apos;s all this rubbish before the big unveiling .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
they knew jealous bits and bytes that they had to attack .
it was when italy won the football world champions .
in our observations , we &apos;re getting into all sorts of uncomfortable areas .
and she was much worse for b than in the memory .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who has more liquids ? &quot;
we don &apos;t just tell stories if we &apos;re doing it to tell stories .
a deception becomes something , because someone is perceiving it .

and because we have nothing more important than our survival , the first ingredients of all the information is part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i got most of the feedback , or where i had the biggest success , those are the ones where i was interacting with things directly .
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend a lot of time thinking about the creation , because if you think about the whole time , you won &apos;t be listening to me .
you have to realize two things : to be a medical fact , amputety and to be the other social opinion whether i am disabled or not .
the basic idea of this company was to transfer the analogous phase of optical fiber and jumping with digital product .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to put the data on an usage -- like we saw it at stuffes .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable , which has a memory of self in a living itself , has very little impact on this story .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and when that &apos;s so poor , people also make mistakes of time .
and it &apos;s going to allow people to measure their blood pressure to send it to their doctor , and to share it with others , for more than 100 dollars .
so the first case : all the zones of atoms that are made up of the metal are still there , and at the same time , the same atoms move out and down .
if i think about creating flow , then i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibilities .
but recently , dna evidence shows that the etrates , the later the roman empire , the same dna as the old lydier lyrics .
how do you increase happiness , very different depends on how you think , and whether you think of the memory , whether you think about the memory , or whether you think about the living self .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a column -- they dig it without the whole complex .
we &apos;re going to turn it on , and we &apos;re expecting the first data in june june , or juli , and put our journey down to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
we want to create the world of the inventors , the inventors of the world , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .
imagine this device in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the pounds of disease and 1.3 percent of the public health workers .
so one day i decided to go to visit the filimestone , and i asked the head of the game , &quot; this model works , that you offer people all of these possibilities ? &quot;
the head of the congress came to the stage and said , &quot; professor romer , i thank you for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
we need to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time machine and go to the future , we will be happy to have this .
so again , i went back with a small team on unknown terrain , and we shot &quot; havatar , &quot; with a new technique that didn &apos;t exist before .
and then we haven &apos;t done that , but that &apos;s me , you know , i think , has been a pretty good idea that people are quite convinced about it .
i mean , it can be strangely thinking about that a thing at the same time is at two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they developed them .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes us from a &quot; uh &quot; -- to a &quot; ta-day &quot; moment .
but the bullets go back quite beautiful . and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not even able to do that .
i was seventh 10 when i took on one of his classes , and i played the last four baloppers from chopin , a late piece of work .
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at everything for you , everyone knew that you had this physical genius that helped you .
on nine people that we &apos;ve committed , one that we have defeated for innocent , who have defeated and taken out of the death cell .
so an organism could learn , for example , a certain fruit didn &apos;t eat , because it was bad , and it made it sick , the last time it ate it .
i personally find out that it &apos;s easier to create a place than find a place , because you don &apos;t have to go in with your ideas in your head .
it &apos;s about how to encounter people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and make them a satisfying experience .
finally , this older black man came in with a very concerned concern in the courthouse and sat directly behind me , almost on the defense bank .
there &apos;s this airplane out of hundreds of thousands of little bits , which are working together to make their flight . &apos; isn &apos;t that visible ? &quot;
one day -- this is a actual report -- this came in , &quot; mite rats in my garbage . can &apos;t tell if she &apos;s dead .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults wanted to know me , she turned to me , she turned into a box of kite and was placed in my hands .
we &apos;re going to have a process that could potentially require 100,000 years , and we can prioritize it for a thousand years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years .
there &apos;s a number of people who have much more &quot; uh-oh , &quot; moments than others , and under the worst , they &apos;re frozen woods .
this means we &apos;re going to look at our first , before we see it , again , to bring it back to our devices in our seats , to say , okay .
his job is to create the conditions that are less than a billionth of the universe after the universe existed -- and this is up to 600 million times a second .
but they also maintain a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to more and more , through bigger creativity and print cooperation .
and many discussions that i had , over the last six years , were similar to the discussion i had in the last three years .
a saint of pension , when you make the power full of water , the pressure is enough , so i think it &apos;s four to six to six seals .
and what happened to me about jacques cousteau was the thought of it was a completely unknown world on earth .
and our european network is basically only made up of louder rotating plants of large power , wherever the wave is all around europe .
a process that everybody knows how everybody knows it ever tried to do anything -- so in other words , everybody here -- not always reasonable .
and every year we ask the students , businesses and services , services that can create within a decade of the mild life of largely people &apos;s lives .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral skull of the universe is far apart , but it &apos;s increasing injustice .
and finally , saturday , a unique , unique style , is a great way to tell the world about a word without saying a word .
they didn &apos;t count , because he was in love with memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had got to get .
i think that the molecular biology in general now , in general , is generally speaking , biotechnology , everything you &apos;re counting , synthetic biology and so forth .
how would it be to make the oppressed , wherever they are , to give you a voice to make attention and change , for the first time ?
i love to find every opportunity to find a different colorful , crazy outfit , to wear , and in the last time , to photograph and blogger .
i used to tell my wife when a person is doing a moral job of doing this because we should try to replace it by literally doing it .
and it turns out that if you make it a little bit more concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people more .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people we love to preserve salary salt , but they prepare to prepare for it .
so we take something very complicated , we turn it into sound , we put a sequence of daughters , and we produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
no , it just looks a lot better if we show that we &apos;re constantly trying to eliminate the dangers , the others can do when they fire .
now , in egypt , the emergency room in april in april 2011 , the headquarters of the egyptian police police , and they found a lot of action .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of programmable work , numerous parallel and searching , tony came back to the first seven years .
so this is what was going to be a problem for this reactors , which we fill in our fill and will reduce the waste dramatically reduction during this process .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point of view : we &apos;re going to digitize biology and now we &apos;re trying to get the digital code into a new phase of biology by building new life and building .
but this is what i &apos;m holding at night -- one of the things that kept me at night . we &apos;ve never had scientific progress as much as we &apos;ve never seen before .
according to burris the premier in january , and since -- and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing -- there was 900 million calls from that film .
yes , that &apos;s a giant debate right now , at the moment of coal-fired power plants , because we don &apos;t , or ganeys , because that &apos;s not the point .
a lot of our friends thought that we were beautiful to do this , and we were going back to cheese , and all the images of the walls were on the graffiti .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst errors only happened in the first five years , which i would argue , but is total nonsense .
but these apps are like little digital memories , that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government who are paying control and receiving taxes .
when i was a student at stanford university at stanford , i went to this very , very exclusive investigation of life , at least he was really exclusive .
in a country that was just going to be a yearning crisis behind the congress was chosen to change this constant change in 124 / 7 .
it seems like we were pretty abandoned from the other parts of life , but in fact , to be part of the biggest , the basic mechanisms are quite our cells .
but the logic of deception allows us to do it as if the first sentence of naught was wrong , as if you were to adopt the opposite of the opposite , without any evidence .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert when i can have the experience that i &apos;m working on for a long time to reexperience how new experience .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing , listen to that . &quot;
well , there &apos;s plenty of marks and eighth marks , these things that come and go , but there &apos;s an eighth , marke is a pretty strong thing .
and if you &apos;ve already gotten to say that the dryer is high complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the data is a science for itself .
if i tell you that someone is living on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self .
well , i did a couple of people in the company , no one could give me a decent answer , until finally i ended up with the lightning biologists .
basically , you get every round of sidewalks in every single way , and as you try to form words , these words are being checked over a dictionary .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine in which i feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little less likely to talk to you about it .
but then another interesting step , very interesting , when things became completely different , because these cells started to communicate and exchange information , so that cells have come from cells .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference , we say , in the climate .
they stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see is fluid and these density , margins .
we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are design components of the future .
ladies and gentlemen , which gives me enormous trust in our future , is the fact that we have more than today than individuals to confront the big challenges of our planet .
so a app that &apos;s written in a couple of days , and then spreading away is a kind of bug in front of the government .
what that means is that if you were meeting somebody , and you would tell them , oh , his father is a two-me-man , how much would you know about his size ?
and when you laugh , you realize how important this lie is , and how much time you need to learn to know what artists can tell us very well .
how would it feel would be to live in a world where the german state of people made , especially if injuries were unlikely to be many jews .
and because the government ultimately determines its power out of us -- remember , &quot; we think people ? &quot; -- how do we think about how this change happens .
are you reliable , stable , soil , safe , secure , sacred , holy , considerable and just like the dalai lama or yoda ?
this is ayhuahuca , who heard many of you have heard the most powerful psychotic paragraph from the repertoire of the shame .
and a lot of times , i &apos;ve been working with sexy people whose gender is gender -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female physicians .

we got to talk about music . and a few days later , i got an e-mail , that nathaniel was interested in my own class .
and since we &apos;re tired of the media campus , for example , the virtual reality in our v.r. lab , we can actually tell the whole time .
i said , &quot; well , you know , you &apos;re the thing , and i know both of these book , if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not entirely my fault , right ?
because it does as much meaning as everything else that i &apos;ve heard about when it was about explaining the absolutely crazy enforcement of creative process .
so it &apos;s so far . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there at the time , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment ever since 27 -- in the diameter .
and i &apos;ve argued that we might be able to create a new form of cambrian explosion in which there might be massive new education based on this digital design .
the reason that it was better than anything was worse than anything bad was worse , it was possible for people to make experience a pleasant surprise .
and i handed out that if i doubled my efforts to the perfect doubt and never again make a mistake that the voice might be silent .
so these are just a few of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but also the last six days can be . or the last six years .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan them to find the different places for the puzzle .
but also , it turns out , because it turns out that we &apos;re using this whole time to actually change the way we &apos;re capable of actually changing the human being .
i can give you the sound of the legs that the bach has , on the modern wing of modern wings , which can &apos;t be a barockckckckckckckness .
already from german &apos;s german to the english , more knowledge can be given to more knowledge , once you turn it around , or in order to get poetry .
bg : now we need one of these scalable , generative things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to use .
if you &apos;re also playing , you &apos;re looking at some nuanced here , looking at the top of your mouth , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows surprise .
you have to imagine that if you &apos;re going to do something of the classic socket , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , just an hour .
i &apos;m a wall animal . to work on every day , i have to stand up at the same time and swim myself , and i &apos;m really unpleased and really unpleasant jellyfish .
so they invented , according to herodling , the box game and agreed a national strategy , and one day you would eat , and the next day you would play .
the other note says whether we &apos;re using the zero emissions , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest .
the movie studio , i sold this as &quot; romeo and julia ship on a ship . it became a movie episode of evidence , a passionate film .
so far , in discussions , it &apos;s always tried to do these insulers who have their own backyard , which has a small web that has nothing to do with our connected and nothing to do .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin where we could actually form the electric rate of the island in the three very closest .
that means that the interpret has to translate these impacts of the emergency language into another language , hearing , concrete , non-concrete music language .
it &apos;s intuitive that it &apos;s not just an apple factor for apple , an elementary factor , elementary trajectory , if i just want to make technological devices of technology .
a lot of journalists called me with the question : &quot; what are you going to do , the one who tells us whether caster is female or male ? &quot;
well , what i &apos;m hearing is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want to do huge fields with a thing that &apos;s wrong .
but it might also be used to get people out of their chairs , and to get them to play together some kind of game to control their health .
and imagine , i have even as a five-year-old child with dr. p.m. and so trying to stop this practice , natural success without success .
bg : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. 10 billion dollars a year spend more than you do -- this is not so dramatic .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us work and interact , and the expectations that we &apos;re forming are the real nutrients of creativity .
and since there was no video games or these transmitters with computer generators , the whole language of media landscape was in the landscape , i had to create images in my head .
as you knew in the village , who &apos;s had what &apos;s going on , and when this is what &apos;s happening today about this extension of ourselves through these mobile devices at a global scale .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i was so hands-on and so i would be able to worry about my patients without having to contact him .
i got a fine ticket , because i &apos;m not on my way to the road , but there &apos;s often a disability that doesn &apos;t drive all the time on the road .
and so i look at myself as one of the people in common with most experimental quantum physicians who need a good logic to bring the complex ideas together .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream about a kind of solution .
jacques cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world of wonder that we could never imagine before .
and if it drives us , of course , to us , to the nike , for nike and mauribs and the whole textile industry .
in each step , we &apos;ve made these pieces of pieces so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process of what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
unlike the 20th century entertainment of the 20th century , the participation of the community is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or doing something new .
my wife , my children and i have moved into the garage , and these hacker and programmers and conspiracy , and archives have taken over our house .
we can take a step further and then look at the data and then see that circular disease and cancer are suspect , but not for everyone .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the healthier , the chlar , the chief , the fish , the fish , the fish , they &apos;re broken together .
over the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has doubled more than doubled the inflation of the average income average income average population in the world has tripled .
one of the areas that we &apos;re looking at is what we &apos;re looking at , in our culture , in today &apos;s united states , is the fighting over the beginning and the end of life .
now , this is good , aside that paul talks about vaccines and talks about vaccines and says , how valuable they are , and that people should just stop calling them .
the second fda is a contemplating of experience and memory : it &apos;s basically between his happy life and his happy life or happy with his life .
you go up into this capsule , you sweat this dark , hostile environment , where there &apos;s no hope on rescue , if you don &apos;t make it back .
so you can also realize that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only about this decline , to be able to see the idea of a hundred percent renewable .
it was executed in the cell , and it recognized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and so we just had a cell with a new chromosome .
and these scientists just documented the various topics that these ceo could be busy , and how much time they make decisions with the issues that are related to the issues .
everybody thinking , &quot; titanic &quot; and avatar , &quot; and would have run out of me anywhere on a tuesday on a weak .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and you should do it , because these love story , as romantic as well as romantic as is always , is also intrinsic .
my first memories are from this boat -- the steady virtue of the motors , the clap of a threshold on the bug , the broader and empty horizon .
and when you manipulate the velocity of this rose , you &apos;re actually able to exploit the rotor , and eventually , even the centrifuge explosions explode .
it &apos;s the living self , the doctor &apos;s pride -- you know , if the doctor asks , &quot; does it hurt now , if i put them here ? &quot;
now , if we go on and on for animals , we say 40 years or younger years , we see that accidents are even the major tower thing that people should worry about .
we should call them what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re creating a commercial , an ecologically ecological capital that enables them to do exactly this production .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use iron carbon that could just be brought to production , converted to carbon dioxide into the fuel in order to make this process .
so when i started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell these story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
when people take this candy seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything on the head , everything we believe , for example , in politics and so on .
it depends on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and the opposite is as if the opposite of the first sentence was already proposed and predicted .

it looks something like this , who has no willingness to do it , can &apos;t be moved to his actions and the main responsibility for responsibility , and it &apos;s therefore unsustainable .
since i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and that &apos;s why my palette will have much more nuanced emotions , emotions and emotions than today .
it &apos;s also in such an artistic aspect of biological materials , and , yes , electronics , combined , and combined it in a pretty different way .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat ocean , is as fascinating as we can imagine .
and then the size of the semantic connection and the feet that &apos;s out of it , is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic network .
i &apos;ve done a survey recently with over 22,000 americans and the average number of decisions that are typically a typical day of americans .

the food that was cooked by a chef or a cohesive has to be cooked , not just chewed or receptacle .
they should talk about these innovation strategy , and they would be smiling from the ridiculous occasions that are made for these innovative innovations .

and then we have a d.c. burning at the top , and then we put the laser out the laser rhim and then tried to focus on this camera .
of course , the chance of restorative instructions are very small to think that you might not be numerous , so the instructions are not going to actually do that .
that is , instead of remembering us individually , we &apos;ve been defaulting , widely spread in maths of memories that we can relate to our personal memories .
and yet the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , which is remarkable clean coal technology that changes you see here , everything .
and so i sent it home , i suspected a quiet in my voice that tried to tell me , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
what do you believe that the average performance for a cardiologist or a nurse or a nurse , a beef , a rescue , should be a rescue assistant ?
this is a people who don &apos;t see cognitive between the colors and green , because the sky is dependent upon the forest that people depend on .
and my love of science came to me in my surroundings , because at the time in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea .
we see many , many gigabytes of digital photos here , the enveloping and continuing while they can remove , on any vertical basis .
this tribe , the codes , 17 varieties of ayas huahuasca , which you all see in the big distance in the forest that appear to our eyes as a kind of a species .
and i was confused , because i thought that whole concept , the idea of advertising , is to present your product as many people as possible to let it look as many people as possible .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the apartment that you have , because you have a job that you can explain to another one .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have come to this distance of earth , to realize that they &apos;re not at all .
that our system also has a pricing , it &apos;s because we &apos;re going to do 20 percent with oil and a price level of rising on the other things .
we have only used to two years of phosphorus , and now will be used by phosphorus global mining much more in the environment than in all atoms .
we projected that 10 years from now , the recognition of the civil rights rights rights rights rights is going to be as high as the adoption of the election legislation .
and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s grown up on the internet , and the knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you just have to build the systems right .
and so far the isolation of isolation , if we &apos;re talking as a species of species , there will be isolation and the change in the environment that could produce natural evolution in a natural way .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science . but i &apos;m going to think now , i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve got to have to do a director , a leader like a ship or something like that .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species and converted into a completely new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
well , i hope that you agree that people are human resources that we can apply to real life , and that games have a huge meaning for change .
now , all of these random reviews are made of , leadership , all of the programs , and charitable people , who are the other ones that are the next . &quot;
these are two very different units , the heritage itself and the memory itself , and the two is part of the decline in different terms of happiness .
if this device has a rarity , or dna sequenced , it &apos;s not known , it prevents the health agency and prevents a pandemic .
now , when you calculate it , people used to buy six times a glass collector , who they had six choices when they had 24 choices .
but it was a pretty abstract debate , at a break , when there was a break , octavio said , &quot; paul , we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve programmed , we went to the beach promaneuver in venice , my kids got involved , my dog , and we created this .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the old greek historic historians , you may know this story . the story about why games were invented .
but i think , in this framework , and with intention , i &apos;m going to make a little disappointment , i &apos;m just going to put the needle in there and go from the stage .
and from my view , the scientific method is to explore things , see if it works , if it doesn &apos;t do it , it &apos;s a great achievement of humankind .
a lot of arguments . fishing scores the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take a big disadvantage . a big disadvantage .
and because they &apos;re much more physically working than us , and because they &apos;re only three to six months of life , they &apos;re in their weight , in the energy consumption of a little tripling billions of people .
so , when you take the system , as i was taught , and all the miserable health outpermitted to sex , there &apos;s no longer any left .
i think that the remarkable thing in the last decade , the last decade , over the last decade , is that we are changing from a physical world to a digital world .
so gender is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some sense , you can be spread across the entire bandwidth .
and by the way , we &apos;re walking around and circulating and mixing ourselves so much that you can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for evolution to find statements .
of course , the stories that i was looking for from the science-fiction section : &quot; terminator , &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
and in this scenario , imagine that in a case , the sperm contribute to a chomosom that hits the chromosome of the cell .
not only from darwin &apos;s work we know that the ability to survive human beings and survive , the battle of the human spirit is determined to change through conflict .
and i was in the middle of the eighth years after berlin , because i wanted to do renewable energy , and that &apos;s what was happening in carlboard .
they believed that creativity was a kind of divine spirit that came from a distance , unknown source of people -- from unknown , unknown reasons .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for publishing drugs for people like you and me , if you think about it , no sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
armstrong was twittering about us , and then in december , it taught us the time-magazine , when one of the 50 best inventions that was really great at 2010 .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people use things that we &apos;re designing .
they were the notion that people who had the political power to do this political power , because of the bloodline from the grandfather to the grandfather and so on .
i &apos;ve let some people take the number of books that have been published in the last five years , and they gave about 40 to about 40 , and there was a lot more .
she came from a man , a african-americans , sympathy , obrau , homeless , who had just had two juries .
and i went back through the same torture of shame and self-doubt , and i felt unhappy and went to work until it happened and again .

it &apos;s that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally , are they define who they are , and that &apos;s the deep and profound quantum mechanics .
penetrating optimism is the desire to do something immediately , a hillside star with believing that we have a founder of hope .
well , very briefly , another reason we cannot think about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life and indeed we live .
suppose you have a blind gut mind , and you &apos;re going to be accumulated to an operator whose average performance is 400 to blindness in blindness terms of blindness .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re probably going to go home four hours more time , but you &apos;re going to have your employer or somebody who &apos;s going to come up with the four hours .

well , i &apos;m sitting here now , on the deck of the titanic , in a dive boat , and you can see the things that are pretty similar here , and i know that the band is playing there .
the film didn &apos;t make any money , in fact , he was just playing his production cost , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience was all over the world like hypnotized from the magic that went out .
if i know something takes three seconds to do it in the present tense moments , i can do very well wait for the time in three seconds , by working with three seconds .
and what you can do with it , and you can just get it to the society and ask , okay , what you know , what you want to do , what you want to do to do with it ?
we put six different flavors there , or 24 different flavors of flavor , and we looked at two things : first , i would keep looking more people standing there and try them ?
and then the analytical technologies , the same engine of science can enable the change to prevent disease , could also give us super-consumed adopting , hyper-hyper-capacity -- the memory .
now , this is a trick that i often teach little kids to be interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about disappointment , even though it &apos;s a very simple way of doing it .
we actually created six months later a reality in which i found myself in a russian diving boat under four kilometers of the north atlantic , and looked at the real titanic through an eye .
now , the notes represent everything else as an accurate record of the composer of the composer , but just a scaffolding , i &apos;m now turning this framework to fill it back up with meaning .

and it &apos;s become a product of software , but there &apos;s also electronics in the electronics , because there &apos;s also a whole crystal scene that make electronics , with electronics , all sorts of different things .

the only real disability is a broken spirit that got broken , no more hope . he finds no more beautiful . he finds our natural curiosity , natural curiosity , our inheritable ability . and our ability to imagine . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and i also changed my thinking in the course of time , if you had asked me 15 years old , whether i had my prosthetic limbs from scratch and bones , i wouldn &apos;t have had a second delay .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture is going to be like in this case , you know , this days , if you drive the roof , you get images of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;

but i have to understand in the core , in the nature of understanding when information is going to be made out of information and information from information , so again , i know how to do things , or i can make things more intuitive or intuitive .
the model is already being jumped in the womb , and it &apos;s cultural , so it works in the world at jung and old , and it &apos;s used by us all the time without most of the ones we know that this model is there .

and when these tools become more tangible , and an awareness for their movements , each other will recognize each other and perceive the enemies of our gangs with them , then we can deal with the research and new entertaining interactive species .
if you &apos;re going to -- if you fall slightly into the ears -- i &apos;ve run a couple of friends in the last night in the hotel room , and some people i don &apos;t know , and there &apos;s a woman almost powerful .

but the question is very simple , if you &apos;re completely independent of any of those fossil fuels , or uranians that are being trained anywhere in the world , and then you &apos;re getting them there , then you &apos;re an island of island .
a lot of them are fathers who are forced to make their families go back to work -- sometimes it &apos;s all-out mothers who have to earn enough money to make food and clothing .
and then it goes back to the front , because the back won &apos;t look at the front , and now , again , look , please look for you and see if what you &apos;re looking at , that &apos;s what you want .
if we don &apos;t get this wish that &apos;s going to be buried between long-term short and short term in the united states , between the united states and china , between poor and poor and poor , almost all of those two billion lives will be much worse .
we &apos;re working in a system where every single day , in which a type of medications is either a wrong or false dose , where hospital infects are always becoming more and more affordable and more devastating or more .
bg : right . now , you &apos;ve got to fill in the reactor , so there are a lot of people , and there are a lot of controls that can go wrong , and that thing is where you open it and make it open -- or out there . that &apos;s not good !
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma host , the smallest genome of a species that can replicate themselves in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do this with a smaller genome .
now look at this interesting statistic that recently published by a researcher of carnegie mellon university university , the average young man in a country in a strong game culture is bringing 10,000 hours to play 10,000 hours by 21st century .
i &apos;m an old house of house , so i &apos;m also involved in the theme of curiosity and the curiosity that will change our curiosity , and why we might lose curiosity and we need to restore curiosity and so on .

most women , like i -- i think i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromosomes , but i think i probably have the typical typical -- most of the women as i actually speak to androgens .
if you give someone a chance to activate their own inner forces -- the human mind is so comprehensive -- if you can do this , and open someone in a critical moment , you &apos;re very good teachers .
that means that you found that you could communicate a common language , you could communicate with each other , in the same cave or in other areas , cities or villages or villages , and so you could create a society .
we need solutions , either one or several of the unthinkable scales and unimaginable reliability , and even though there are lots of directions where people are looking after , i really only see five of these big demands .
now , when i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of them are registered . some of the science comes from science , some more , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes out of the music .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve just been involved in a couple of years with biohacking , and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve started to do , because i just wanted to know and make it more important , and what i &apos;ve learned in the study of theoretical theoretically .
and i left the medical school with the impression that i knew if i knew everything and knew it , or at least as much as possible , as close as possible , as i could make the courage to make the errors .
and then , if i go a step further in this kind of natural future where i &apos;m going to make voice , voice per , language , per capita , no more mouse , and i have to control the cursor , i &apos;m even faster and faster .
that means , i &apos;ve actually left you now in a way that you don &apos;t see any pattern in the middle , but i &apos;ve got it in a very short period of time , again , to see this dog in this image .
in the moment , where i turn my hand away from you , so you &apos;re moving from the back , this finger , my finger , just from where he was , in a position where he &apos;s so extended .
not to burn the eventually a little bit better , and to burn it in the charges of the fuel materials for a whole bunch of circles , but first of all , how do you create circles ?
the first thing that i saw was this idea that your brand of recognition had separated two , but the other day the murder -- the morgan is an eight-hour / marshell .
in other services , like the production of fertilizer , 105 : 55 : 55 : 600 ; elderly : 05 : 55 : 55 : 85 or air traffic or traffic , the play for much smaller improvement .
we &apos;re seeing this here , when i &apos;m looking at things , i can confuse them like the right side of the right-hand side , where i don &apos;t know what sales are and psalt , or i can make them intuitive by showing things .
this is what it turns out , if you offer a placebo in a white pill in a white pill , in the form of an aspirable trajectory , that &apos;s just a round , a white mushroom that has a specific effect .
the cohlands of evolution is the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a degree of power in the form of electricity plan , and so we have refrigerators , climate change , we can make modern materials , we can make modern materials and so many things .
we took the light off , we turned it into a vacuum and cleaned the entire air and cooled it up to almost all the time , in the metal alone , the metal was free to act like it was always wanted .
but because this isn &apos;t happening here , we can push it down , and people like mccarthy can walk around and messages of fear and illiteracy and illiteracy of illiteracy platees like rah and larry king live .
together , the intact cultures together in the world form a web of spiritual and cultural life , the earth filled the earth , and probably for the earth as important as biologically as you know , as biosphere .
for example , if you take this kid in the north part of the amazon , the people of the amazon , the people who believe that they were growing mythological river from the middle east and the sacred snake .
some bacteria have figured out how to keep up from penicillin , and they &apos;ve written these information together with other bacteria into the dna , and now we &apos;ve got a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because the bacteria communicate with each other .
and i want to say something that &apos;s a feminist for a little bit radical , and i think that there might be different kinds of insights that could apply different kinds of anatomy , especially if people think of a group .
let me introduce you to me now , the one that was carried by amboo boxes over 19 years ago , a spinal cord injury that the result was that it couldn &apos;t run for more and 19 to now .
something interesting happened in &quot; abyss , &quot; to solve a narrative problem in this movie -- and that &apos;s how we had to create a kind of liquid water creature -- we used in computer animation , cg , back .
and dr. kean said , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they don &apos;t ever get anything else , and even if they get a little support , if you can only get children , then they can get very much . &quot;
when we get to these really big sticks -- with over 100,000 base pairs -- they &apos;re not going to just grow this in ecoli . it &apos;s going to grow up to all the modern molecular biology , and so we turn on other mechanisms .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an outsider , a newly delit , new image -- and not just okay , but something that you need to be grateful , maybe a gift of the booth .
and so , i think , from the city , a very different view , a very different impression , because i see negative and positive zones of a city , and so on , this way , and a different kind of virtual map , virtual map of a very real city .
but that &apos;s the most important thing that can happen , because this is the group forced to help enable patients to help patients , because that might be used for obesity , or it could cause the patient .
as i said before , i &apos;ve been able to admit myself over the years to some pretty awful situations , but nothing could prepare me , nothing to me , anything like this , and as dangerous as these guys could go into a room .
and that &apos;s very amazing , because you think that this technology that you &apos;re looking at , you &apos;re looking at that there &apos;s actually a guy in the future , but in fact , it &apos;s the future where we &apos;re looking at our archaeological roots .
and because i was born without waving legs , and my feet were looking for them , and i had just had a few toes on this one and a few toes on the other side of the brands , that strangers had to get the bad news .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was talking about 20 years ago when i first told me that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of attack .
when we &apos;re in a game world , i think that a lot of us turn into our best version , right now , and currently we &apos;re ready to try to solve the hard problem , as long as it takes for the misery .
and since i &apos;m just one of these little devices , because the things are always supposed to be more intuitive , always , natural use , friendship and you have to look at what is actually meant for people , which is , of course , use friendly or intuitive .
you &apos;re not afraid you &apos;re going to take your hand for a long time , and you &apos;re never going to get something and you &apos;re going to die on a pipeline -- your mouth is filled with the aspiration of the road ?

they took these photographs from the forest floor , they tried to see the face , or they saw the character , and they concluded that this was the visitor of the devil , and the five miserable mixture with the spears .
i used to write my synthetic dictionary , but i was involved with the work of the writing , and i noticed that i never checked in my life , which means &quot; disabled . &quot;
geris oeconomies of africa , and with that sentence , i would like to conclude , and again , to give the hints , designers need to think differently to come up with new solutions , and in this sense , thank you very much for your attention and attention .
and i know it &apos;s definitely that for me -- in my situation -- it &apos;s very dangerous to catch this dark , this dark fact kind of downstairs kind of downstairs -- particularly in the circumstances that i &apos;m in my career .
the older black man stood up . he saw the deputy , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come here to tell this young man , you &apos;re not going to lose your eyes . you &apos;re not on your own . &quot;
so , the problem of cooperative online worlds as the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to support jet jet at the edge of an episode that we prefer to spend our whole time in these worlds .
later on the day i went to this site with miguel and i asked him , &quot; one place that seems to be so different when every farm i &apos;ve ever been on , &quot; how do you succeed ? &quot;
last year , i showed these two slides to show that the arctic ice caps , which had three million years the size of the bottom 48 states to 40 percent .
in urban communities everywhere -- from los angeles to philadelphia , baltimore -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men are either in prison , either in prison , in prison , in prison or in ubiquitous terms .
immediate after this election between the 21st century and 24th , 24th , a delegation of about 30 famine scores to the two places that were interested in most of the world in getting into the town of the town .
the last example that i have today has to show is a musician sequencing for trips , which we &apos;ve recently developed and recently in the fatal as a voice , such as leadership , hatred and stuff .
and we started making pieces , starting with the fifth of the five , seventh letters , contains this annual to make 24,000 letters to bring them back to 25,000 .
and they empowered us to tell the story of the neuromarketing , as we tell the story in this movie , that you use mris mris to prepare the fun centers of the brain , both to make advertising and films .
this is how i started thinking , and so i think , with safety in the past months while i was working on the book that was soon going to appear -- as the dangerous , dangerous , scary , strong expectations of my expectations .
both in my profession , robin and my side , as a ceo , i &apos;m a volunteer man of generosity and generosity in the big scale , but i also look at the next of love and mutations of the individual .
suppose you &apos;re living in a certain remote area , and you have a beloved person with a heart disease and your households and your doctor overlocked this doctor into a cardiologist whose average performance is at 200 times when they &apos;re in 200 .
but when i was doing it with my phones , and i asked him why he did this intervention -- it was high-risk operations -- his answer was that in his country , these kids would treated very bad , and so he had to do it .
and of course , when something is intuitive , and as i can take on this , i could actually influence and shape things like this , that they use a friendly way , so they &apos;re intuitive , so they &apos;re intuitively intuitive because they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re easy to use .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- the ones who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t make any mistakes , the people who have the sleeping bag and without the limitation , the bad results and the good results .
it has three big problems . the cost of the cost of highly regulated countries are highly regulated , and the question is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human work that the fuel is not used for weapons .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid to have a real gasoline , and it holds millions of people from bloom .
now , deciding to decide not to buy a glass collection is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our tactics -- but it turns out that decision-making decision-making issues also affect very conspiracy .
i don &apos;t have to hack out of these things , because in the same corner , it &apos;s always going to be a different crazy , colored , colored , affordable , just waiting for me when i have a little love in your heart and search .
so this is one effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision that we make less happy with the outcome when we have the opportunity to choose between ourselves .
this is a photograph that i took on the northern end of the baffled islands , when i went to the inustite jail , and this man , aolya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , when an tyranny of the memory of the memory itself , and you can think of the memory itself as a kind of a vibrant self that doesn &apos;t need the experience of living itself .
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the morning , i do all kinds of weird things , but then i go up to other people , and i listen to all these things , because i don &apos;t want them to belong , or frankly , they go .
in the rich world , in the upper world , we might be able to use pockets and use less abundant , but in the average , the number is going to increase every year , and so it &apos;s going to be more than doubling , the number of services per person will be provided .
i met these guys from grass , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to extract any light on any given surface , and then draw with a laser pointer on it , which is only the negative level .
so what that means when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and especially as we see in the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a number of possibilities .
so there are big challenges here . there are challenges in transmission , and for example , if we say that the energy of the country is outside the country , you don &apos;t just need to have the technology to deal with the risk of where the energy comes from .
but , as we think , the only way that biology has a huge impact on the cost of food costs , or the limits of the repository of their availability , is when we look at co2 as a footprint , and therefore we &apos;re working on these cells .
i started working with scientific literature about how these centrifurious refugees are built in nates , and found that they &apos;re structured in what they call the kaskage , and each box contain 164 correctly .
now the fascinating thing is that the daycine , which are in the liane , mao inhibitors are exactly the same kind of thing that &apos;s necessary to ask the tryplane . so , they ask themselves .
this is a problem , because the global warming is frozen by the arctic ocean , in which there are large amounts of frozen carbon that , when it &apos;s suppressed by microbes .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the target of the attack was actually too slow , and unheated -- obviously in the attempt of trying to make engineers desperate , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get behind it fast .
so perhaps the more technological change in this technological change , because the fact that there was always a different truth , which is that any person in society can do something very special and very powerful , and there can be a human ability to adapt to the human ability to adapt our scale .
my good friend ray of mine has shown us that every tool that &apos;s going to become information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law is going to make large numbers , and the price performance at exactly 12 months .
the first project that we did as an international group , as we became aware of our own self , o.k , there &apos;s us now as real scene here , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people that are always there .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents you never had to walk , and never be as moving as other kids could or that you could never have a independent life , and since they just left me . &quot;
what if we could turn this situation , and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going from one to another , we would start to go from many things to many things , and detect pattern , which pattern would be hidden ?
this is what we feel so guilty about the earth that we &apos;re saying : there &apos;s no biodegrade , no bioluminescence , no alternative prosthetic progression , and all of them , that allow our own excrement to go back .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i was doing something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in terms of individual organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is being led in both dead cells .
that was worth it for me to eat this year in the clean space , because they checked the mask of the difference between a single atom , and this piece of metal is just as much as the difference between metal and all of them .

he spoke in a very hot , and he was talking about yo-yo and hillary clinton and clinton about how the dodgers would never do it in the world . and that &apos;s because of all the boxes in the first feather of beethoven decline .
every time we think of orbiting and landscape , we &apos;re either protecting rouses , and the old scaffolding of the noble wild , which is a simplistic thought , or even the sidewalk and saying , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
i wanted to go back to the routine , and the emphasis of the life of a unknown front -- a grandmother , a grandmother and two daughters that have been linked to every single day as 20 years since the stories that were coming together and close to each other , we still end three in the same bed .
but we don &apos;t even know if we listen to someone as something like this , because we &apos;ve been able to know this kind of thing for a long time . somehow we have the perception so emphasizing and collective light and collective creativity , and of course , sort of , feel that art and end up with the end -- always lead to the seal .
and what we did was actually use a new kind of network that was used throughout the world -- this is a mobile phone web -- and anonymity and anonymously made from this network that are collected from the neothest of the grain to understand how the city works .
and then the renaissance came together , and we had this big idea . and this big idea was this : let &apos;s put the human individual in the center of the universe -- all of the gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no room for myth , the feminine feminine of the gods .
in our desire to protect people who are at the heart of the arts and them , harsh truth about their medical prediction , or even a prosthetic arm to the quality of life , we need to keep them out that we don &apos;t miss the stone for that somebody is actually disabled .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that can overcome the problem of decision-making -- reconstraints -- you &apos;re going to overcome the overwhelming alternatives ; concrete -- you &apos;re doing real categorization -- we can better deal with categories , fewer possibilities of complexity .
because we have this self-deception , this sense , to be great , tribal sense of the highest nature , not one of these kinds of real things , something that is so uncalculated as a organism that exists in an organism that &apos;s accessible to some of us .
and that &apos;s when you &apos;re all talking about your feelings and the queues of labor and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about , the government , the government , in the core , in the words of tim lo &apos;o , &quot; what we &apos;re doing in common alone we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
so this seems maybe first seems to be a bit abundant , so i repeat it , so that if we can solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , i think we need to be able to play for at least 21 billion hours a week for the next year .
and our goal was , we wanted to get to seventh down to nine-percent , and then the rest of these , the rest of the last , the last 10 , 20 percent , 20 percent renewable , which is going to be very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work out of batteries .
but what &apos;s going to be 17 is 17 margian partner who were willing to get these control , who wanted to do business with someone so remarkable and how i &apos;m going to play , and who ended up being able to tell us stories that we don &apos;t normally have stories -- the stories that usually would never support .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never simulate any reasonable simulations , whether it would work , but since there &apos;s modern computer , you can simulate it , and you can see that there are , yes , with the right materialistic approach , it looks like it &apos;s more functional .
but the process of the process and the heavy climbing it was surrounded by it when it turned out to be the gene out of it , where it wasn &apos;t as a physician , and it made it back where it came from . he realized that there was no internal crashing , elders had to be elevated .
this curious event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called biography , pray pray , love -- that , unlike all my previous books from whatever the world went out to the world , and a great mega-lapse , international action thing .
a continent will always be exaggerated because the assumption that in sub-saharan africa there was no religious belief . of course , there was a voodoo and odoo is simply the overseas of this very profound religious thought during the tragic pora of slavery .
but in fact , we &apos;re seeing it more and more and more , if you &apos;re willing to confront yourself , and the important ways are going to be articulate , then there &apos;s a rise to the numbers of the numbers , there &apos;s a healthy cost , and there &apos;s a improvement of decision-making .
and one day , he observed me in one of my practices -- these were simply tired and gnad -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so powerful , powerful and you &apos;re going to be one day , one of those vaccines of the fears .
and the wind and the sun and the load continues and came to the conclusion , a very exciting outcome of the result of the conventional conventional system , which after 20 years after about five cents a mile of kilos per kilowaters , it takes about four cents an hour , about four cents a four-cent .
and the problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can be just a holistic problem , which things like simple things , so a simple problem to throw out a question , a question , and how can you do it differently or how to do it better .
borders of croaching plants , skull floods , harmful advance of monodies , chemicals on earth , beds on fish , and all the time , the agricultural industry simply asked , &quot; if we feed more people , how awful can it be ? &quot;
not through the latest harbor residential rescue and ktrap inventor , but through fruit land , not through pump , not through fresh water , not through fresh water , but through forests , and not through fishers and boats and boats , but through fish in the sea .
so this is one that has more artistic direction , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and philosophers in collaboration with scientists to sit down with these technologies and ask questions , and to process the creatively , there &apos;s a creative museum , and there are all kinds of things .
and they remove the out-of-the-box co2 that leads to the temperature of temperature , and this temperature has increased several very negative effects . effects on the weather , and maybe even worse , indirectly , that the natural ecosystems can not change like this , and so all these systems are collapse .
the chief beatles are things that are forgiveness , like the prince , tied , time-fed , decrease , and love like the flynn , and agile , professional , magical , magical and mystic , as gandhi .
in other words , she was not fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t reached the house , and she didn &apos;t get the poem through them and pass it through them , and she said it would keep on moving across the country and -- as she said , in a different way .
maybe this may be a modern contribution , and if you were better than me , that would be awesome , but my core statement here is that we need to work on all five of those five , and we can &apos;t give you any of you , because you &apos;re all concerned about , because all problems have significant problems .
and where you can see how far away we &apos;re away from what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , and how sad are we , at least on earth , can you see that , for example , there &apos;s a program to be a four-year program here , you want to be here , you know ?
in my 20-year medical records of 20 years , and journalism , i created a personal medical study about medical error and false procedures for my first article , i wrote the first article for the torture of my torstar &apos;s &quot; white coat , &quot; black art , &quot; to learn .
so , with the total transparency of transparency , what the new thinking is , what the old thinking does not say that in the laser tower , and not a beef of meat , or other phenomena , i just want to do that , and i just want to do the cold .
now , not exactly what i hoped that i was hoping , but i went up -- the stairs , the passenger , the passenger pig , the real firemen , who were at that point , at that point , were quite ready to get the bedroom in the room to get a few shoes .
i had to repeat individual practices often repeatedly again with these thick , elines -- in various colors -- you know what i mean to build my leg muscles . and i hated these bands more than anything else . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
but we wanted to go even further , and we wanted to build a whole bacterial chromosome , and it has more than 50,000 letters genetic code , so we thought we could build it in the size of the virus that we could understand the size of the virus that we could understand the size of the bacteria , which is a single component of a living cell .
and from a conversation that morning , with dean kamal , one of the innovators of the country , i want to share with you -- he gave me the permission -- his permission , his engineering , &quot; the slingness , &quot; and the many of you may have heard . it has the size of a refrigerator in the home .
&quot; clouds &quot; clouds , &quot; something that would call my friends at autodesk &quot; in automation , sensors and sensors , robots , 3d printer , the printing of our planet to democratize personal , synthetic biology , vaccines and digital , digital food , nano-engineering and artificial intelligence .
look at this amazing demonstrations : voodoo acinity in a wall , the light bulbs , without burning charcoal , an amazing assumptions of the mind of the mind , so that it holds an extreme state when it comes to an extreme condition .
this was the most surreal form of a sad√©ju , which i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i got around a corner , i knew what was going on in the stream of the light bulb , because i was filmed with monk film , when we turned around the film .
in this picture , i &apos;ve had a busy as a center of desperation in all directions , because if you look at the tree of the tree of life , all the existing existing existing existing on the two of these evolutionary corners , they live in evolutionary terms , it has survived the strength of the environment and demonstrates .
and so this premise with this premise with this premise , for example , brian degger &apos;s tried to do it in england , a minimum collision , then a steam costume cap , a hot coat , and , yes , has painted , and then bacteria can do it .
and then , from the do-it-it-engineered website , and i said , &quot; o.k , we have to meet really , really , really , really , real , and then two organized events , a second of london , and short on the u.s. , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco . &quot;
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- you want to get zero toward zero and the number of people depending on the number of people who use the service of every human being in the average , the average energy for every instant , and the co2 , the energy that will be emitted per .
and the realization of president lobo , was that the wisdom of the debate that i thought about was a way to get the foreign investors to come and build this city meaningless for all the partisa in duras many years and years of fear .
i read this list of my friend according to me , and i had to laugh at the first time , and it was so ridiculous , but i just came to the court , &quot; and i couldn &apos;t speak more , and i had to stop reading , and i had to find myself in the first time that we had to overcome this case , and to make an emotional shock shock shock .
a group of ara , who i &apos;ve learned a while ago , who &apos;s a student who &apos;s a student who wants to convey the public who wants to convey more what they learn in college , and they &apos;ve done so on behalf of small shareholders and trying to explain what &apos;s called n.n.
there &apos;s a 175 address in my supermarket when you don &apos;t count 10 different olive olive sticks and 12 bars that you could buy a large number of salad in your own dessmile , in fact , that the fact that there &apos;s not a 175 bike in 175 for you right now .
and this was really , really , really , very bitter , and then you get into the phase of it , and then you get into the phase of it , and you get the picture through a picture where i asked me , 10 years , a thousand years ago , the last one , lovely , lock-approximately , of course , whether it &apos;s really great to be that .
first of all , what i &apos;m going to do is show you as quickly as possible , is the basic work , which is a new technology that we have as a piece of microsoft , a very precisely a year ago , and that is seadragon . and it &apos;s a environment where you can either be able to visualize local data , or large amounts of visual data .
the first one , if you &apos;re going to be a child when you &apos;re a baby , when you &apos;re a baby , is that you have to take care of what kind of failures you have , right ? and depending on whether your parents have no longer allowed you to play more or less in the game , and you stop playing more , some more , sort of , your curiosity will be bursting your curiosity .
i mean , most of the moments of our lives -- and i have the error -- you know , the psychological presence is about three seconds long . what it means is , you know , there are about 600 million of them a month . in a month , there are about 600,000 . most of them don &apos;t leave behind them .
bill gates bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we just need 10 million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s reasonable , you &apos;re only in the 1000-million .
and this really works , this is what &apos;s going to be done in academic , and then we thought , well , o.k , which may we get too , then have a webcam that picks up the pipeline , the lens , then you have a microscope , which is about four times the volume .
if i show you 600 magazines , and i put them up in 10 categories , or i &apos;ll show them 400 of time , and i &apos;ll show these 20 categories in 20 categories , then i believe that i have more choices and i &apos;ve given better selection than i have given you 400 of them to the 400 if i gave them 600 to 600 .
friday friday &apos;s friday , friday , friday goon friday friday . here we go . there &apos;s a way to go to the kim , the knees . friday friday , friday friday friday . friday &apos;s friday . you don &apos;t think we were going to have this conversation without talking about this conversation , i hope to talk about .
i think one of the most significant things -- not the only one , but a significant exchanger to this depression , and even suicide , is that people have learned that their standards are so high because their standards are so high , and then , if they have to explain that experience , they have to be able to blame , they would be their blame .
the neolithic revolution that brought us to agriculture , and at that moment , we were underpinned the culatrics , the poetry of the anesthesia through the prosthetic director and archaic hierarchy and hierarchy and hierarchy , and only 10,000 years ago .
and that &apos;s when you focus a laser on a space , and you can catch a little particles in it , and you can catch little particles in the air , or in the liquid , and then move in that focus , so that &apos;s where the laser is started , so it &apos;s kind of like a cheetah basically like an intrajectory principle .
well , it would be great if we could put that paradigm on the other side of the possibilities or strength , even in a little bit more dangerous , we could delete . so we could put the forces of very many children , and invite them to put their special skills in the society .
you know , when michelangelo shaped the moses , it &apos;s called the end of the hammer , and he took him on the hammer and he waiting -- you can still see a little bit of untended under -- and she said , &quot; chnon parli ? why don &apos;t you plan ? &quot;
but if you &apos;re now in 2011 in 2011 today , a new color printer buy a new printer from the leading printing presidential printing press and printing a page , then it has this side helpless batch on every page on its side , in a pattern that clearly tracks you back and forth on its printing back .
my colleague , at mit , assaver biderman , could tell you much more about the true and the many other wonderful things that you can tell , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part of the second that we first discussed in the beginning , and that &apos;s the confrontation of our environment .
now , the problem -- the problem is , even the problem is that even those of us who have the sympathy for the harnessing of the inorgency , they look at orginig and colorful , but they sort of look at the past the past , while the real world is reforming . our world is continuing .
and then i tried this in my lab at my lab , and i tried to do a little bit , and then i got a little bit like that , and then i bought some hand-packed bay on ebay , and i tried a little bit of ngo , and i was trying to do an aerial analysis , so that &apos;s the way that / na fingerprina prina prince , and i did even go home .
and if you were to choose a different vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between the two of the self and you need to think about how you &apos;re deciding this conflict , and it &apos;s not really obvious , because if you think about it in the sense of time , you &apos;re going to have an answer . and if you think about it in the sense of memories , you could get a different response .
in the early 800s , i got a really astonishing job when my professor asked me , if i was interested in taking haiti to go to haiti and film the secret societies that were the foundation of the stupidity and tons of cousin , and the poison that was used to make sure that was safe .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me how i &apos;m going to go with drilling , and i &apos;m going to give you something to you : this sentence never fits for me , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable asking people to do this , and i think , everyday life , why i understand why .
and if i do this now , for example , in the orientation , i think as a super-centered , selected as a selection , in which case it all comes up to me , i can look at it in the detail , and say yes , i can send it anywhere , or buy somebody , or buying somebody else .
i recommend all of you to read the book , or look at the film , so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness between these two men , but also how the music has made that connection , and how it helped the instrument when this game is allowed to get the alongside , the middle of getting the road out of the street .
so here at the bottom of the picture , you see this is the lab in the lab , so it &apos;s a kind of a garage called a garage with everything else &apos;s labeled labeling , which has a group in paris , which has been completed , which is quite successful , and it &apos;s kind of interesting , because i want to cut a project .
no biologist would claim to claim that 50 percent or more of all species die just before the extinction , because it &apos;s not easy . and yet , this -- the apocalyptic scenarios around the biodiversity -- barely the biodiversity -- barely what makes us think of the most optimistic biodiversity in the area of cultural diversity .
bg : well , we haven &apos;t yet begun to a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting openness rules for everything &quot; nuclear &quot; -- there &apos;s a big interest in the name , and there &apos;s a lot of people who were in russia in russia , india , china -- and i &apos;ve been here , and i &apos;ve met the empowerment of energy , and how this fits the energy field .
the computer visions have given these pictures together so that they have the real room where all the records of the grassroots i in the canadian rockies were made in the canadian rockets , and you can see elements of stabilized by stilas or panoramoric , and these things were all set up in each other &apos;s relationship .
and then , if you look at the software that we &apos;ve just seen on it , you &apos;ll also understand why ninety ninety-nine percent of our software , or not at usable , is ipad ipad , in many cases , or in many cases , it &apos;s intuitive , even though it &apos;s more classical .
the result is that -- we call it patients &apos; patients &apos; lab . it sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift is changing the power of someone who knows something about someone else &apos;s choices -- you know , the name probably doesn &apos;t know anything too much of somebody who knows , and is probably not too sick and is not in the best constant to make a decision -- namely the patient &apos;s name .
and this idea was when i was in the middle of my life in the process of presenting , pray , love . i fell in one of these crafts of doubt that we all fall when we &apos;re working on something , and you don &apos;t think of it . you think it &apos;s going to be a disaster in the middle of it . the worst book that was written in .
we also have one of these same gaggregate in the same size , as it says in half , to actually look at the full dynamics of the web , so in half of the grid , in which it looks like this in the back right now , the giant battery is here , the big batteries here , the whole judge is surrounded by which we simulate the web .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical creature that was believed that it was believed that it was literally in the words of an artist &apos;s studio -- about the dobby , the doorstep , the artist , and the artist , in a certain sense , was building the invisible assistant to the work , and the work would make the work out of the work .
now , if i want to close to you today , it &apos;s that the amount of data we consume is bigger than the sum of its parts , and instead of overlapping information , i want to think about how we can use information , that pattern and so forth that we don &apos;t have the most visible .
so we &apos;ve done a study that i did with shlomo and alessando acro , we &apos;ve done a study on people -- all worked for -- and these people have been in a collection of a collection that they &apos;ve collected in their curriculum for their curriculum .
well , interesting historic footnote : when the mosquito charges they brought this use . the language changed over the centuries of allah allah , allah , allah , allah produces a moolar , mentolds , mentolds , still fighting to fight sticks and flames . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ;
now , what you need now is , if you want to win a race , actually like this one -- something like this -- something that &apos;s happening in real real time , some thousand sensors that have sensors from the car that keep this information on the system and then you &apos;re going to use it to make these decisions and then make these decisions back to the car and make things happen in real time .
i was frightened not because of it , but i was afraid i could lose him to fall into a circumstance , and that i could destroy his relationship to the spirits , if i started to destroy tons of glorious and pearer and other exciting forms of dagoggogy .
so , in fact , the fact that you remember the 20th century , 300 years from now , not for your wars or technological innovation , but rather than a era where we were against and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on either side of the planet , either passive or acceptance . so this is not the change .
i had written this piece of avatar , which was the measurement of things in visual effects and computer generic effects in a whole new way , with real , realistic human expression that had been made , and the figures were made . and the main number of things should be cry . and the world should be cg , and the world should be cg .
i &apos;m probably hearing , probably the two girls are still there , because i &apos;m likely to hear the generation of the generation that &apos;s funded for this bad metric , because i &apos;ve been studying hundreds of thousands of disnectful engine already started to go into cardboard boxes , technological engineering school , today , i think , today , today , that &apos;s what i believe .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a question of questions , after one of my lectures , one of the reports of the story . &#91; unclear &#93; , he said , he would have heard a symphony , and it was absolutely gorgeous music , and at the end of the recording , there was an awful cycle of the sound .
do you know ? i think to allow a blown person to think that he thinks he or she &apos;s like the vessels , like the advance and the essence and the source of all , creative , unknown , mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious is a little bit too small to ask for a much of a human mind .
but my dream here is that if you can do it economically , and at the same time , the co2 is also saying , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t want co2 , i wish that it &apos;s going to accept it almost every day , but i &apos;m going to accept it , because it &apos;s cheaper than the cheap way . &quot;
it &apos;s actually the kind of choices that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who has two mirror reflections of two different surgeries , and then you &apos;re supposed to choose which one &apos;s chosen , the memory is the remembered , the memory is less , and that &apos;s what the surgeon is going to be chosen .
you know , all of you know the healthy ones , if you give a secret of the best price , even though that one is swallowing away and then you hit the best friend and the best friend will resonate with it , and a horrible discussion , if you will , at the end of a bad conscience , you will make a sense that you will never make a mistake like that .
you know , one of the great people in travel travel , and one of the joys in the ethnography research is to live with the people who are still remember the old days , and the past is still feeling their past , and they &apos;re still in the rain , they &apos;re on the rain , they &apos;re touched by the rain , they &apos;re feeding in the leaves of the plants .
if you ever have the opportunity to work in your urban center , in a urban center , like our scott silver lining , as part of the program -- in fact , they all do -- you see that people who call the government , because of many different problems , including problems , including a thoroughly , including a rat in their house .
in fact , the beautiful thing is , if you do this , agriculture , biogas creates biogas , on a hectar country with fifth inhabits in favelas , it can actually wait about a hundred dollars worth of farmers and wait for the facility to cheer and produce a chickens and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables .
we &apos;re at the threshold of the threshold , amazing events in many areas , and yet i really think that hundreds of years ago , we have to go back to the enlightenment to find a time when we fought progress in progress , where we have these things done more of the trips now than we have now .
so by using color , by contrast , by contrast and heroes to the single images of the individual images , photographing photographers , looking like depth fields , depositing deep colors and colorations that we let the boundaries between the different borders and let them look like a single picture of each other , although an image can actually contain a picture of hundreds of old levels .
if i put a room in a room full of colleagues , and to ask their sovereign support , and to tell you what i just told you , i probably wouldn &apos;t be able to reach the second story until it really would be unpleased , somebody would forgive you a joke , they would forgot the rest of the talk and forgetting the rest .
now , if you &apos;re one of those things that don &apos;t accept the biological evolution , this would be a very good time to take your hearing device , take your personal communications device -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can take a look at kathryn &apos;s -- that &apos;s what it &apos;s about , because nothing else is going to do in this talk , you &apos;re going to do for anything else .
a few years ago , the laser prize was given to shinya yamanaka for his research into a adult , a fibroad blade , and the manipulation of just four genes to bring them into a pluripotent cell -- a potentially potency to be able to get into any body .
and in order to show the dimension , i &apos;ve got all sorts of batteries that are made by batteries , the cars , computers , cell phones , toys , towers , everything , and i &apos;ve used with the electronic energy that uses the world , so i found that all batteries that we now produce less than 10 minutes of total .
now let &apos;s take a step back to the big bang over 14 years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first indiances of living beings , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first root organisms that may be as much as a billion or a billion years ago -- and then the human species that formed in 130,000 years .
this is a reconstruction of cathedral notre notre , including the computer with flickr , and they just put an emergency mr in flickr and they &apos;re going to get images from men to t-shirts at the university and so on . and so on , every day , this orange represented painting was discovered as a model that was discovered as this model .
and yet , here in this country , in the united states of south , we &apos;re building people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted , getting higher , when the victims are white , when it &apos;s black . 22 times higher , if the victist is black and white -- that &apos;s in the same state of the world , in their bodies , their bodies become more robust .
i was traveling at a young age 6,000 miles from chimp you in west china by southeast tibet , and only when i went to la hata , i saw the face behind the statistics of 6,000 monuments that were turned into seed and turned 1.2 million people , and millions of people who had been fed by the cultural revolution during the cultural revolution .
and so the idea is that , now , if you have all kinds of problems , you &apos;re going to invest in something that you &apos;ve only got later -- and that &apos;s why the investment is not so clear . in fact , the ipcc is not necessarily the worst and there are people in the rich world , looking at ipc , and saying , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not a big deal . &quot;
we put the chromosome on the chromosome of the microbes in it . in fact , these two socks are far apart from each other , like mice and mice , and we gave some extra genes so we could choose this chromosome . we were able to destroy it all around an enzyme , and it was a very astonishing cell , and it was quite amazing than we could put it in a cell -- and we &apos;re going to raise our very large numbers here .
margaret mead , the great anthropologist anthropologist said , before she died , it &apos;s her biggest fear that while we were moving towards the fact that we were going to move an aircraft , generic , we were not just moving the entire bandwidth of the human imagination in a way that we had a memorized , but that someday we were forcing a dream of a dream , and forgotten to forget that there was ever other possibilities .
and i &apos;d like to show you a little bit of the original database of noah , and this is from a early prototype of photosynth synth synth synth synth that we &apos;ve been working in the summer to show you what i think it &apos;s really the point of view that technology , which is the photosynthetic technology , and this is not necessarily the way that if you look at the environments we &apos;ve looked at the website .
in other words , sugar pillars have shown a measurable effect , placebo effect , and that &apos;s because the person thinks about what &apos;s happening to their pharmaceutical pharmaceutical or a kind of painful management -- for example , if there &apos;s only enough effect , there &apos;s a measurable effect in the body called the placebo body called the placebo effect .
if one said no , it was the vettup of cattle , which has been completely crushed for 10 years , i &apos;ve been doubling it for two years , whether i &apos;ve mastered my great engineers to actually turn it into a hostile thing , because all the colleagues of my father have always given me to say , you &apos;ve got the money to pay for the window .
i had recently met an encounter when i met the extraordinary american in rudith stone , which is now over 90 , but the whole life was dididious . she told me that when she grew up in the villages of virginia , she was working out on the fields outside , and she said she could hear a poem about the landscape of her landscape .
what it means is that a small child from the people who are growing up in the belief that the mountain is a puppet that &apos;s a pile , or their destiny , will be a very different human , and have a different relationship with this resource , or a place of this place , as a small child , a montana that grows up in the mountain , that &apos;s a pile that &apos;s a pile of stones can be eaten .
usually my role in telling people how wonderful technologies are going to come up with the new technologies that are on the side , and i thought , because i &apos;m here under my friends here , i would tell you what i really want to do . and i try to look back and understand what &apos;s really going on here with this incredible leap , which is what &apos;s going to happen , which is how fast we can bark out .
and that would be their answer to the bjr borne argument that if you use all of this time and energy to solve all the carbon problem , all the other targets , which suffers , the poverty reduction , the malaria of malaria , so that it &apos;s a dumb waste of money waste , is money to invest in money , while there are things that we can invest better .
these people have come online to rigid online , but they &apos;ve made it illegal , for example , for example , they &apos;ve used trojans to claim money from our bank accounts , while we &apos;re doing our online banking , we &apos;re also logists , or our keyboards , who have our credit card information about the keyboard that have collected about how we buy a computer online .
and again , two of their olds came back to montgoma , where they had two old friends of their elders . these older women , johnny carr , who had never organized the montese boomerkyor -- had an incredible african-american -- and american virginia , a white man , a white guy , his clifford , mallemine , malaytah , dr. bathar .
and they set out , and they have two horses , they put two together , and they said , o.k , which we do , and we have cheap , and then we have open source , so open source hardware , hardware , electronics , this device , and they now have the corresponds to the market , and the market are actually the cost of these checkers now , the cheapest fears of these cheapest parts of the world .
and that made me go to another person when my friends were under kwatutl , who believe that these forests include the forecasting place of huk and the genes of the cotton and the hippies and the channels are the channels , the northest of the world , the spiritual world that they would engage in their hair .
a week ago , a week ago , the national academy of engineering engineering engineering for francis huaris and wilold wild and wilderness , two scientists who work independently to encourage each other to encourage the natural process to hardly encourage and to perform a widespread protein in a certain kind of a french way -- which is called the nold nightmold evolution .
and just as we move towards biology , because i want to take this metaphor out of synthetic biology that comes from synthetic biology , that biology is actually an information science , because the na code is a abstract code , which is a abstract code , which is not just like computers , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s dynamic , so , so it &apos;s just real , and it &apos;s not just real .
and a well-known researcher brown , a well-known design researcher at brighton university , has gone so far to say that this mass media , he thinks that the book and the picture is not the internet , so the internet , and so on , and so on , what we call &quot; mass media &quot; today , &quot; that these mass media are generating mass media , &quot; and we &apos;ve captured our online .
in fact , some happy people and companies , for-profit companies and profits , profit profits that gave me a unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never leave the other person again -- the right to buy the rights role in the talk , you know , just didn &apos;t have a lot of content or any content in the world , and didn &apos;t have a lot of content on what was going to be the theme .
now , this phrase from the passage from the passage to the idea that success depends on success , or happiness , is a challenge to prepare , not to be seen by the permission , but as my life would be so successful as if my life would be so successful , because i could fall in a proposition with a proposition of prosthetic , or as i could always relate with my disability .
and when these guys came and looked at these guys and they looked at who was the best proteins in the world , this was not a professor , caltech student , it wasn &apos;t a tech student , it was somebody from england , a chester , a woman who was talking about stunt assistant when he was working in a business class in a business class , and the best mayor cup proteins was the world at night .
of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. p.m. , so i did not want to do the practices that i didn &apos;t want to do with , with the fact that the number of girls in the hospital are going to be in the second floor , but he actually taught me to look at my everyday actors with new eyes . so that &apos;s how a new experience was made , and a new experience of experience .
in the past year i &apos;ve been looking for models for models for this , to do that , i &apos;ve also tried to find myself in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they had better or better , better ideas about how to help us deal with the creative risks , to deal with the risks that are connected with creativity .
so we have a situation like this , where the further advances our science , we need to be able to admit that these categories that we &apos;ve given for the stable categories , which had very simple inherent inherent dna to identify our identities , are much more infected than we &apos;ve gotten as much of anxiety .
so i went home , and i went home , and i went home with my wife , and i told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , if there &apos;s this technology , if you can use your eyes to control your eyes , then we should find a way to pick up an instruction , that he could make a laser so he could be able to do that again , but that would be brilliant . &quot;
and so there are different , but the nice thing is that a molecule has so much energy as much energy as we say , a carbon molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , and you can basically have the pressure of pressure , and the pressure costs , and the costs , the potential , and the potential , so the potential for the country , and the other things , almost like this , is doing other things in your own liga .
from the medical point of view , of course , you can say that my legs , the laser surgery for visually impaired , commodity dients from titan and artificial chicken for aging that allow people to really use all their possibilities , and the limitations that have made them more natural than their destiny , not to speak of social media , to form people , to define themselves in a way , and to define their own way around the world .
&quot; disabled &quot; , adjet : &quot; crashed , helpless , helpless , destroy , destroy , crashes , dishes , discriminate , disgust , confirm , consolation , honestly , impered , abandoned , paralyzed , paralyzed , racy , odorodor-in-hancement , rejected , rejected , eyearted , reed , disposedly , seminated , searching , searchy .
i &apos;m going to leave my closest words to an english scientist . humphrey daday , the way i suspect , when he was using the experiments of his defense , his defense was michael faraday , said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the human development of the human mind that our scientific imaginations are not a mysterious thing that there are mysterious in mystery that our mystery is not a new world ; and that there are no new conquest . &quot;
and we &apos;re going to travel a series of companies in the ethnosphere that we &apos;re taking our audiences from such a place of cultural wonder that they &apos;re going to go from the laws that they &apos;re going to do , and hopefully they &apos;re going to take a place where they &apos;re going to refer to the other side of the central anthropology : that this world has made to exist in a different way of living , that we can actually find a way in a truly global cultural world that we can really emphaside people from all of our well-being .
does one of them have one of them come through the big choice of saldswallows , if they buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what is it that saldressing ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that they could make a decision that would have better . and what &apos;s going on here &apos;s what &apos;s going to be the alternative to make that decision that they &apos;re doing , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to do , and this negative , that &apos;s all the negative of the content that they were doing , that they made them , if they made them a good decision .
and at the end of this amazing initiation , they will suddenly be taken out for a day , and for the first time in your life , in 18 years , you see a sunset of sunset . and in this crystal moment of consciousness &apos;s first moment of consciousness , when the sun begins to strike down on the beautiful landscape , suddenly , what &apos;s going to do in the abstract abstract mathematics , and then , in the abstract fashion , and it &apos;s going to tell you , &quot; and i &apos;m really going to tell you , how do it ? &quot;
in fact , what i found was extraordinary was that he had collected my entire childhood all the time , whether i had won a letter in the second class , whether i had won the p.m. at the top of the parade , whether i was stationally abundant , i was wearing my pencil , or a athlete , or a seventh of my seventh students , and he had this medical school in the medical school to stop the medical school , and the medical school , the medical school from the medical school .
and if you have people who are convinced in front of them , who are persuasive that they have a soul or a soul , or you can also say that they &apos;ve been given the soul of the soul to life , then they &apos;re going to imagine that it would be about as if the soul would be such a soul , not just about matter of matter of meat , of course , of meat , of course , of course , of the meat , of just meat , of some kind of stuff , of the earth , of the earth , of devastating the earth .
so , as an computer scientist inspired by the way of our interactions with real objects -- with my consultants and my colleagues at evaluan kalworthi , i started to wonder : what if we could use computers instead of the computer , like a fingertip of a fingerprint on the top of a bottle , what would be like to do when we could do with each other -- what if we could do with the physical data , and attack it so ?
so , i would like to summarize my talk a little bit about what i would like to summarize my talk and the senses that the properties and the skills that we have made from the voyage of voyage , and that we &apos;ve gone as a little bit as a result of machine in the age of machine that is called cyrus by the name of cynics , and that we can get back to this kind of technological kind of technology , and that we can actually come back to our new products , not actually come back to our future , but to actually come back to us .
three years from now , their families are separated from age three and four years of families and their families are separated in a shadow world of stone , in stone back-sized quarters for 18 years , two at nine years of age of nine , they voted the age pregnancy to six months of age pregnancy at the age of nine months of pregnancy , to make the shooting for nine months of their mother , so they now shrink in the mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s herorphanage .
at this point , javitato javitao said , &quot; what happens when we take an undelayed land of our land -- if we just take a message to a message , part of the american embassy , part of the american people -- and if people want to work under the table to work under the canadian rule , they can work under the united states , or they can do anything where they &apos;re usually going , and they &apos;re going to do anything , and they &apos;re usually going to do it all the way to do ? &quot;
i &apos;d like to end with a poem by a poem poem by a poet named in 14th century haz , and the friend of my friend jacques has told me . and this is a poem called &quot; god knows only the four words , &quot; every four words , &quot; god doesn &apos;t name the god , the god , the god , the god &apos;s boiling god , not just the god forbio , but the one who is just repeating me and he says , &quot; just tells me .
if someone had made a mosquito , and all of these sacred scripts have divided up and divided into all these sacrifices , and who you are all , then my photograph of the emergenre cathedral , suddenly turned out to these data , and i can use them as an output to use in this room to use these audiences , into these different photographs , and use these other kinds of tools , and make a more social experience of the other people .
but also , we have the problem of a growing entrepreneur , and then we have a huge amount of energy , but also , of course , once again , we have the problem of a growing entrepreneur , and then we have six , a small group , that we decided that we start to go back and start to go back and find the next topic of my future , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to say , again , again , that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be able to say , is that people are going to say , &quot; what &apos;s not going to be doing . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t last much space for it to be in the malaria of the acronym or the mumbai or the old tibet of tibet , but still through the ritual , there &apos;s a mystery of light on the planet that doesn &apos;t seem to be anywhere near the idea , but there &apos;s a far known idea that the idea that you can only exist in the world , because you can only exist in human mind .
to make the system evolving so that the system turns out to be able to make the bathtups , which make it easier for people to make it easier for disorders , and make it more powerful , that can actually be observed in any health care , that can actually be used in the healthcare , that can actually demonstrate what potentially potentially potentially potentially be , and make the mistakes for people , and for me , and for the gratification , and for people how to reward them .
i even have a professor with my professor , richard evan , who &apos;s the head of psychedelic , who has been able to meet the psychedelic with the magic in mexico in mexico , and i &apos;m saying that you couldn &apos;t take that as a hallucinating moment when you &apos;re not going to experience the right now .
and then one of the things that happened later was filmed with robert juniz and pe-in-law as many of you will know the story of the story , because from steves , a book about this later , that was filmed with robert juniz , as steve pelog and foxy , as a foxawis , who came along with the juvenilliasts , the juveniler of juillio , who ended up by the most conservilluminating parliament , and ended up by his parliamie parliamie &apos;s early age .
for example , women used the law , says anatomic is more important than the atomic difference , and we said , for example , to use women , the voting , the voting , the concept of the foods , says that anatomic proposal is more important than atomic difference , and we said , &quot; we have a mother and fate and faiths as a difference is not the fact that we shouldn &apos;t have the right to have the right , not the right to have the right to poses , etc .
now , we &apos;re all using email , or many of their competitors or their competitors , but they &apos;re very much larger in the united states , like iran , where they &apos;re going to use foreign cures , they &apos;re more than they can trust each other than their local vacations , where they know that they can trust more than they can trust each other , and that they &apos;re located in the local government , and that they &apos;re not so local , that the local government can &apos;t move their locations .
so i ended up going to be interested in the space and sitting in the trajectory of wedding space , and so i ended up running the people with the space for the space and to do with nasa , and in the wedding guinets and space agency , and they go to the russia . they go to the russia , the biomedial mission , where the biomedical music is going to take root , and then take the space station , and then take the space station and then take all the gramuniformly and take our gases .
you know , coat &apos;s name . i have the rescue to say , &quot; i &apos;ve got the worst nitrogen , &quot; my apartment , &quot; and i have the rescue to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to every rescue of every rescue to the rescue of the doctor &apos;s hearts center , this is my worst mistake , &quot; oh my worst mistake , h , h , h h , h , h , h , h , h , h h h h , h , h , h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h ? &quot;
we had to go back and say , &quot; we had to do the fiber , the whole technique of technology , the human difficulty , &quot; when you go back to the country , &quot; and we had to do it , we had to do it through the jar , the weakness , the whole crack of technology , the ability , the human difficulty , when you can explain it , &quot; if you &apos;re not able to explain it to others , then you can &apos;t explain it in the other seas if you can &apos;t do it , and tell somebody else .
and wherever you look around the world , you will discover that these cultures are not underminded . these are dynamic life expectancy , whose existence is held by existence , given the forces that the capacity of the earth are low , and whether it &apos;s about the size of the infection in the middle of the fall in the fall in the country , there &apos;s a nomadic in the sea of sargassum of asia , or the people who have been living in the middle of the sea floor , and who are now living in the south africa , where they &apos;re living in the middle of the south africa , where they &apos;re living in the middle east of the sea , and they &apos;re living in the sea floor , where they &apos;re living in the sea , where they &apos;re living in the sea , where they &apos;re living in the sea .
if there &apos;s a matter of real time , if there &apos;s no matter what happens , whether there &apos;s a lot of money , if there &apos;s a lot of food , there &apos;s a lot of money , there &apos;s a lot of life going to be , and there &apos;s no matter what &apos;s going to be a lot of real time , there &apos;s going to be a lot of life going to be a lot of time , and there &apos;s going to be a lot of time , there &apos;s going to be a lot of real , there , there &apos;s going to be a lot of times when you get there &apos;s going to be real time when you get there , there &apos;s going to live your life , and there , and there , and there &apos;s no matter of matter , and there &apos;s no matter which is a matter how it &apos;s no matter how it &apos;s a lot of time you &apos;ll be a matter of time you can &apos;t even having a matter how it &apos;s no matter how it &apos;s a matter how you get
so , in fact , the leafy modeling is just about a sickness of amino acids in the middle of the city , but it &apos;s a little bit of a lever , and it &apos;s just crushed in the middle of a left-size , and it &apos;s not just a red cross between the middle east , but it &apos;s not going to have one of the middle eastern , and one of the right whislands , and it &apos;s not just having one of the red ones in it , but it &apos;s not even the middle eastern of the middle eastern india , but it &apos;s not just one of the red soaring down into the middle eastern ones that kind of the red sofumbrellyfish , it , but the fly into the fly into the sea floor , but it &apos;s a rivers of the middle of the middle east , it &apos;s a rivers itself . it is , it &apos;s going to grow up in the red , it
now , in fact , if you look at the shortage of life , the buddhist verages of the world is still a vibration of the world , one of the world &apos;s finance is not only one of the most vibration of the myths we have in favor of the world , one of the most violin , of the most violin , of the world &apos;s southudic table , of all , of which is still alive , that we know that there is just a non-hill in the shorter of the world that we know that we have a non-hill under those who are still alive , still alive , that we know that we know that there are no matter that is still alive in fatheraimmigrant mortality is not only about the most of the most of the most likely to death of those in the world in the sea level of the world , but that the crosant life in the crosons of the
now , in the midst of girls , the six-ray of girls today , they live in less than 10 years ago , and they live in this little sea , and they live in each other about three years ago , and they &apos;re living in a little sea , like this little girl , and they &apos;re living in the sea , and they &apos;re living in a 30-year-old girl , and they live in their little like less than 30 years ago , and they &apos;re living in a sea today , and they &apos;re living in a 30-year-old girl in their little sea , and less than a sea , and less than one of their wider than 30 days ago , and less than 30 days ago , sea , and less than 30 years ago , each other , each other , each other , each other , are they &apos;re living in their little , and they &apos;re living in the sea , and they &apos;re living in the sea , and they &apos;re living than three or less than 30 years ago , and
now , in the middle of the world , i &apos;m a sea level of anomalous desert , or in the middle of the middle east , i &apos;m an accomplishment of the middle east , or in the midwinner desert , or in the middle of the middle of the winter , there &apos;s an ant coloscological desert , or the accurately , or the middle east of the earth , or the middle east of the earth , whether it &apos;s in the accurately , or the middle east , the middle east , is a sea floor of acid colominjuries , or the earth , who &apos;s an acre , who &apos;s an acre in all the germ in all the acuctant in all the acia , or the acia , who is an acoracoracindoors of us , who &apos;s an acoraccream , who is an acocolocolomiranium ,
