seattle ...
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s the singing .
but it &apos;s about .
don &apos;t find it .
yes , hello .
we love innovation .
solar technology is ...
that &apos;s not ...
we were poor .
are they all ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
after a week .
great trick ?
we were .
a few less .
and he says ...
we know that .
ta-da !
wait twice .
here it is .
it goes fast .
they need time .
music as language .
that &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... not yet .
thank you .
what a fish .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
that &apos;s efficient .
wonderful , ne ?
totally inefficient .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much .
get them .
the only chance .
no hospital .
thank you very much .
stephen watts .
three .
that was incredible .
thank you . thank you .
yes , sort of .
it &apos;s terrible .
long , yes .
fantastic , right ?
the sun goes on .
oh my god .
we love entertainment .
we &apos;re going to pick up .
after home ?
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we lose them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
a whole lot .
sounds good ?
the whole environmental discussion .
sounds familiar , what ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
this is great .
that was fascinating .
can i be honest ?
the farm is incredible .
what did they do ?
robert gupta .
this is the system .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
yeah , good day .
lento , slowly .
this is all interested in me .
we can do that .
what do you say ?
not very sustainable .
yeah , milliseconds .
this is our present .
they have similar principles .
yeah , good day .
good work ! yes !
just do your job .
this was the result .
thank you very much .
and she did .
so they meet al .
it &apos;s essential .
they &apos;re all important .
very different term .
unbelievable .
this is actually me .
gear is funk .
yeah , that &apos;s going on .
flying catches .
this is the last one .
can we change it ?
these days are over .
these people make money .
what &apos;s happening here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
do it again .
and that &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know .
centers were built .
what &apos;s happening here ?
but you know what ?
what was the result ?
i was amazed .
it &apos;s generic .
so they knew everything .
you could see manhattan .
here &apos;s the video .
it has sensors .
why not live longer ?
he opens the door .
a few more .
that &apos;s very good .
oh , so , the one .
there &apos;s no normal .
yeah , i know .
pretty good , not ?
but you know what ?
i have a question .
okay . thank you .
i stood up to him .
players don &apos;t sit around .
so they create that .
they &apos;re shopping . &quot;
so let &apos;s see .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
what do these people need ?
i don &apos;t think that .
i thought about it .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
they use their hands .
so how does this work ?
how interested in them are .
that would have been okay .
what are media today ?
you can go in .
so where do we go ?
so it &apos;s true .
how do we know that ?
because you know what ?
it &apos;s not a country .
why do we do that ?
not very often happens .
bg : thank you .
this is a wish .
and i was artists .
let &apos;s call him don &apos;t .
not school management .
and it has to go back .
we can do it differently .
they &apos;re actually going to do it .
and i understand that .
an immense challenge .
there &apos;s no food .
it &apos;s against justice .
but the wrong things .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
i &apos;m a writer .
here &apos;s another example .
i meet children .
it feels great .
i swear it .
i wonder .
it &apos;s not going to do it .
thank you very much .
why should we do that ?
thank you .
here &apos;s an example .
you see it immediately .
not toxic inside .
but i was working on .
or before bombs .
i go in here .
there are two opportunities .
we need energy miracle .
why does this happen at all ?
oh . one moment .
i want to tell you .
what do you want to do ?
that &apos;s what happens today .
and i worked on .
so she was back .
and so it was .
yeah , here it is .
i agree to you completely .
and why is that ?
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what would all be done ?
i mean the soul .
you compare the same thing .
in china , it was different .
luckily , yes ?
but that &apos;s not a protection .
let &apos;s get pee a chance .
does somebody see something ?
and i always had .
very expensive mobilities .
people were playing crazy .
what does the illusion make ?
my building feeling again .
after just one journey .
first : limited .
i created one .
yeah . well . good .
imagine the camera .
jk : both .
but it gets worse .
here you see it .
thank you very much .
be a mentor .
maybe 10 times .
but it didn &apos;t .
the data came in .
this is a great question .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
it has billions of people .
have you seen these guys ?
there &apos;s something else .
here &apos;s another example .
is it photography at all ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
ohhh .
and then it became international .
there were remixes .
let me summarize you .
okay , a few more .
the answer is no .
just further . much fun .
my name is amit .
he had the experience .
it keeps you fresh .
this is a great question .
is that your opinion ?
almost an identical structure .
and it got better .
that was what they did .
it took him very much .
here you see the city .
good day , everybody together .
am i going to like the color ?
ooh , thank you .
some have come and went .
i don &apos;t think anymore .
dk : 60,000 .
there &apos;s an old study .
it &apos;s not designed .
the game is from 2007 .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
he &apos;s called paul open .
so what happened now ?
who will make it safer ?
first , we have the population .
i don &apos;t like this question .
but what do your fish eat ?
let &apos;s call him don &apos;t .
that &apos;s forward .
the work of interpreted .
but where are we useful ?
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
how do we actually work ?
... his own story .
i will never forget that .
so what does that mean ?
now , what does that mean ?
private sphere has to be .
there are online criminals .
we have three main groups .
it was still fish .
he always showed up here .
and then it happened again .
i felt really good .
and many people forget this .
crisis . death . disaster .
it would be inadequate .
it &apos;s not our fight .
it &apos;s not our problem .
we lost contact .
why not think about this ?
we love technology and creativity .
it would be knowledge .
we &apos;re constantly breaking each other .
and this opens a map .
but what do we do with that ?
that &apos;s something like this .
what am i looking at ?
his name is tempt .
will it have my size ?
that sounds crazy , right ?
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
we need to spread the message .
that &apos;s what most of you know .
you also have to understand that .
this is what you see down there .
i want to ask you something .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was destroyed on the ground .
it &apos;s like this .
is it about light ?
i grew up in india .
this is the short-term .
you see the water coming .
i had a good life .
so what happened after that ?
who are these related ?
i wanted to keep healthy .
these changes are in the world .
how about fitness ?
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
but the key thing is ...
he &apos;s working on this .
and then they set up .
what &apos;s actually happening there ?
the oranic tractor .
they really love it .
but i felt worse .
the two smells me up .
woman : overlean technology .
very frightening .
what &apos;s the soul ?
we &apos;re not producing more ourselves .
i can claim everything .
he went down and went down .
what can we do yet ?
this is what the graph looked like .
now , i get to the end .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
it may sound bad .
we were 20 people .
so we &apos;re too many .
you can &apos;t have bones .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
or is it possible ?
there are conflicts of conflicts of creativity .
so what do we need to do ?
they didn &apos;t have books .
this is felix .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
thank you for your attention .
this was the beginning of the journey .
i &apos;m so honored .
and then everybody went down .
they saw the great outcome .
first longevity , second .
well , i was the next one .
frankly -- who &apos;s normal ?
and finally , epic meaning .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
the same thing , just bigger .
who is the most successful ?
you want to feed the world ?
i wanted to support them .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
i just loved two love .
one place is south korea .
again , you have it again .
this is such a natural thing .
my wife told me .
and how did this feel ?
that &apos;s what you can train .
do you make it curious ?
so it &apos;s circle .
so why now hack ?
this happened around christmas .
what is it for a thing ?
so , you know .
they could have done better .
the answer is yes .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
and that &apos;s not anything .
is that reasonable ?
so this is the good news .
it was a huge success .
so you saw something magic .
&quot; yes , he said .
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
but can &apos;t be a problem at all .
then they always say , why ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
it was just not invented yet .
echoes should work yet .
anybody knows what this is ?
for example , this perception in context .
this is a game outside .
this is god , you know ?
but it was very sad .
so let me remind you .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
and it &apos;s the x .
sometimes i get too much .
but they &apos;re doing the job .
and they &apos;re connected to these two people .
her mother moved her alone .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
think of your own decisions .
this picture is from this place .
i see this sign .
and it took 18 months .
tell me about this world .
this is very risky .
and it worked very well .
again , he showed him four .
i learned everything .
and there are hundreds of them .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there &apos;s good news .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
that really made me sad .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
but that &apos;s not so fast .
how can we help you ? &quot;
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
no one had never been a chance .
the story is not over yet .
what &apos;s happened on this day ?
well , then we want to do it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
they come from the artists .
i should not say that .
the power plant can explode .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
she did it for three years .
you can have these clouds .
the data was not available before .
play is not albern .
well , how could this happen ?
is it all about education ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
so that &apos;s what we can do .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
everybody talks about happiness today .
it doesn &apos;t work very well .
play is not just child games .
and that was 19 years ago .
what would you like most of them ?
they create an epic story .
they have so much uncertainty .
the data continues all the time .
nobody said that before .
so paul is a terrorist .
and that &apos;s what he says .
don &apos;t take anything like that .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what should our beliefs look like ?
this is a lot of volume .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
i &apos;m almost never going to do it .
she was back and die .
and of course , this is incredibly treasure .
and again , the representation .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
an autistic student .
when it &apos;s the garbage right now .
so not like detox .
and that &apos;s what we do .
we depend on two countries .
everybody needs a goldfish glass .
let them be ji . &quot;
people were still happy .
it was my first sunlight .
he actually collected fish .
my name is brian goldman .
they share their experiences with others .
the white lines stand for population .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
he showed up on the algae .
this just doesn &apos;t do technological .
there are four and a thousand people .
and you have a problem .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
every waste is nutritional .
and we &apos;re too many .
so the question is : how ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and it was an incredible experience .
we can &apos;t get rid of him .
but there are two problems in it .
i started feeling better .
but , you know what ?
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
that was a lot of thickos .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
we &apos;re in an area .
and that &apos;s what we did .
basically , they do the same thing .
now this is one of the images .
what other marks act like this ?
and then something weird happened .
they can play with different ways .
the whole building was made of water .
italy wins . yeah .
on the morning , the game .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
creativity had to get out .
today , everything is easy to have .
the nurse asked nurse .
i should not do that .
maybe in our cell phones .
and it starts with a doctor .
i &apos;m going to tell you something .
we use the energy of the sun .
this is all metametadata .
because i can claim everything .
it &apos;s always going to be similar .
but slowly it made .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
what are you trying to do ? &quot;
further than we don &apos;t go .
what lessons have we learned ?
and the form plays a role .
they can &apos;t store energy .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
okay , that really makes the courage .
once we started a vibration .
my second mistake was worse .
and you &apos;ll notice a 257 .
we all love baseball , right ?
somehow , kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
this is about five feet long .
they &apos;re going to be free in the free .
because does somebody have masses here ?
and then reconcile it .
under other things , things shouldn &apos;t suffer .
this is the biggest impact .
the movement for reasons to write it .
anyway , not to navigate .
and that &apos;s really in the beginning .
the truth is more like this .
do you want to solve jeans ?
so you can &apos;t do anything .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
her family melted .
thank you very much .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
what else is risky ?
just be you , who you are .
i remember my first fire .
what does a story look like ?
dark . dark . dark .
so i tried to make something exciting .
but very effective , yes ?
but we need the total .
nuclear missions , yes ?
this is completely belong .
let &apos;s keep that quiet .
hmmm , my brand ?
this is scary .
it sounds frightening .
next : nuclear energy .
it &apos;s a very exciting phenomenon .
i wanted to be normal at the time .
and i &apos;m going to show you now .
once the judge saw me .
we can &apos;t do that easy .
so i went to the court .
i got a little scared of technology .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
and there are several reasons for this .
they sell certificate .
it &apos;s not being documented .
why did i go to medicine ?
it can know where we are .
it spreads itself .
all adults were aware of the risks .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i like things that are different .
i went to jail -- difficult .
it didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
this is a child game , right ?
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
and this video is in real time .
the game begins -- swiss .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
what about longevity ?
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
so the koran is devastating .
so , look at what happens .
so the dynamics really changed .
so i just started playing .
and then we said , okay .
yes , these are the data .
i &apos;m going to shoot something through the head .
have you been neither disk ?
this is like learning learning .
because for me it means memory .
how and what did he recommended ?
we say in germany .
so you can &apos;t solve that at all .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
it turns out that it &apos;s really difficult .
and you know what i learned ?
these will be unresisted .
but what &apos;s going to come in the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
this has nothing to do with science .
and that can make a big difference .
but there &apos;s another reason .
in any case , we need a solution .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
so i hear it , thank you very much .
they killed the channels .
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
we started 15 years ago .
how far do you get there ?
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
you know what neither is ?
so the first step to a interpretation .
and it &apos;s still not a interpretation .
that has to be the difference .
if you come to that , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
that &apos;s just the minimum .
we can win our nutrients back .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
on the book and on the image .
this picture reminded me of something .
i find them off .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but maybe this is not the case .
and what does that mean for designers ?
i want to show you this .
it was a pretty fate project .
here he leaves the sun .
this is the memory .
these rivers are taking the rivers .
a has these benefits and risks .
our newspapers are read by millions .
lego made it possible for everyone .
privacy is not about the debate .
they were genetically armed .
i &apos;m the new physician .
i don &apos;t take the same lost .
baseball is full of great statistics .
because we live on a water planet .
do we really want to go into this direction ?
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
this gave you a evolutionary advantage .
and these are the neural structures .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
oh , my time is over ?
i &apos;m going to get a little bit .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
so we measured his movement .
this is a picture of the object .
apparently it was quite popular .
you see something fun here .
i really like beautiful clothes .
he can only use his eyes .
but the truth is far away .
you can do that all the time .
so this crazy story could be true .
who would ever be a wish ?
the netherlands would have been too easy .
her father died shortly after her birth .
for a year , we had no cents .
we need to increase the complexity slowly .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
here &apos;s your margin .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
but then they really want to be deep inside .
you want to orient in the museum ?
that was more concrete .
okay , you really want to know that ?
and i had to get out of the city .
we won some prices .
who doesn &apos;t want to healthier children ?
it makes light on kids .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
no , i mean really serious .
i hold the knife in my hand .
and the goal is very simple .
i shoot my sleeve .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
now i see greece moon .
one billion people are going to famine today .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
i loved this fish .
no , no , that &apos;s not going .
and this sounds very different than before .
he was over the sixth of sixth .
i started a institute .
they &apos;re actually getting funding .
the movie hasn &apos;t been given yet .
we need to think of what marks are .
what do you do with it ? &quot;
i call this the top density .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 .
this is not necessarily something bad .
this is ideology , not science .
and that brought me around .
today , 6.8 billion people .
just like that , it will come .
it &apos;s busy about shopping .
the hot projection today .
automatically , he walks to the right thought .
that &apos;s how natural things are done .
but it requires a lot of planning .
we can reinvent everything else .
as we think of north .
and it depends on phosphorus .
often in the third one , again , forget .
longer than those other two networks .
the stones are color .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
it &apos;s about changing values .
i started with my usual talk .
this is a very sensitive question .
i learned this from my grandmother .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
how do i get you away ? &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
and every morning i jumped on it .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
these are more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
it &apos;s very good .
what would they describe ?
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
there &apos;s also world record .
to ask , what &apos;s the right thing ?
in the people over the uranium .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes .
the living beats the spirits .
they gave their blood pressure up .
thank you , but the best is coming .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
happy productivity . fantastic !
the result of that was catastrophic .
and everybody in this room has to be in .
here &apos;s the olive oil process .
bjins in sundles .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
&quot; risk is not a simple game .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
we &apos;ve been running a lot of procedures .
this is probably going to be available in public .
my brother stared me .
this is the apple saras .
i talked a lot about magic .
who could have looked at this ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who do you actually want to inform it ?
completely on a particular goal .
what do you think happens next ?
they have . they have always .
so this is a hard ngo .
it &apos;s more constant .
they literally put the shirt .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
i hope you &apos;re going to show me .
most of all , if he died .
so there are two circles .
the product is clean water .
it sounds very unusual for the first time .
we built unique elements here .
you get rare animals .
it will touch them deeply .
he died , broken through the story .
here &apos;s how the building works .
they went through each other .
tell them what they feel .
the other one was strong .
let &apos;s make a little interplay .
here you have this little mechanism .
he &apos;s collected .
the interest is to make firefies .
the question is , what &apos;s going on now ?
the students are divided after grades .
these things are logically correct .
and here you feel it .
for energy , i noticed this .
i &apos;ve tried to understand them .
all these generations need just a few milliseconds .
and that &apos;s where nobody seems to climb up .
that i had written these crazy things .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
this is just a little less destroying .
and the curiosity is not learning .
this is also a paradigm shift .
a dalmatiner , right .
you see from the back to the front .
so from the modern society in the computer society .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
we need to come far , and it &apos;s fast .
it &apos;s a neutral of america .
they &apos;re all wired questions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they &apos;re the healers of somebody .
we &apos;re walking through ritualistic rituals .
now look at this curve .
jokes are just too easy to live in our lives .
i meet people in death row .
they were inspired to be inspired .
maybe some mutations .
so scott gets this anger fruit .
we were working until late the night .
so i followed my own feeling .
he moved back to the silence .
now we saw the reverse effect .
caves have all the audiences .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
so ... so , not so optimistic .
it switches the bloodges .
let &apos;s start with the truth .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
they had a concept of blue blood .
i believed everybody could do that .
i never learned it personally .
even cats look at this video .
there was jimmy kimsky .
let &apos;s think about atoms .
how would you describe your brand ?
we &apos;re talking about cool , fresh .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
no , that was what i thought .
i &apos;m a redundane person .
that &apos;s not the route .
this is a painting of a circle .
the roof was also covered with water .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
and women argued the successful .
we can support them to be good .
look at what it does .
the main man winds to me .
sexual nutrition comes into the image .
i read you the contract .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
that &apos;s the truth . i think it &apos;s me .
we talk about twenty of it .
it was really unbelievable .
he was shaking his head , no .
this is going to happen in the next april .
we also got very accurate data .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
mechanism comes from the gap .
but with the right design , please .
we can support them to be good .
just to say , what is information ?
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
there was never been a time like this .
and even lomborg thinks about .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what does it happen ?
and also , these sources are interrupted .
how will you feed the world ? &quot;
this is an ecologist network .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
the cookie had checked him .
you &apos;re like this .
this is such a contract part .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been represented .
what does five milliseconds take a million seconds ?
i see the dalmatiner .
it might take , until it &apos;s invited .
maybe again , you have to see a look behind it .
no , no , far away .
and this picture was recorded by atlas .
156 nations send our television canal .
they helped their internet connection .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
she was not yet trunk .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
this is the system that we live in .
but i was interested in these questions .
and that was what i felt .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
you also test what wishes .
something very strange happens here .
and that was the outbreak of this .
i learned some very simple things .
it can know how we hold it .
so it creates a backwards .
boston doesn &apos;t only have a call center .
this is a small app .
the ufer comes from another place .
&quot; they don &apos;t leave them . &quot;
i lived in parallel worlds .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and i &apos;d like to read you the suggestion .
there &apos;s another aspect in history .
you can be logical and intuitive .
tell me a little bit about this part .
make it possible -- you &apos;re all here .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
anybody know what this is ?
so this is the reason for this project .
it &apos;s called &quot; i &apos;m with me . &quot;
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , circumstances of these kinds of circumstances don &apos;t exist .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
we can make ourselves something like this .
so the first exciting primate .
and there &apos;s a staff of staff .
daniel kahman : sure .
everybody would like to make people happier .
the domain also plays a role .
and why ? genetic food .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
we now have masses in this country .
not even the truth will be free .
because now you can apply a three-sentence .
you &apos;re looking at the timeline .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
but it &apos;s not just the words .
thank you danny kahman .
we get an absolutely flat line .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
because we don &apos;t want to shoot genes around ?
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
they do the process , they understand it .
there &apos;s a lot of stuff that needs to come together .
and what do you do with the garbage ?
bad ? i was completely confused .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and then he can walk in .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
his personal tone of the saerodynamics .
i &apos;m trying to do this for an example .
it just has to work as a present .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
this is a year of water flow .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
it &apos;s a small virus of bacteria .
now this level of intuition is very important .
so litta is open source source .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
they grow five inches .
maybe i did it with guilty reason .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
let &apos;s get something else out there .
it &apos;s all coming out of our own bags .
normal people are not available . &quot;
as an artist , i &apos;m very important .
here you see roberto dancing .
and no matter , italy won the end .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
but the game is a format .
thank you . i have a question to you .
he had 20 minutes of music .
well , i &apos;m going to show you .
this is just an insurance method .
it should recontain the two elements .
shake the environment , make less waste .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to talk about .
yes . you don &apos;t find anything else than discover .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
a language is expression of human mind .
it was a hockey .
what you need is a new medical culture .
alone , damaged and without support .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
i think our identity is threatened .
many of my mandatory are very young .
my cousins all over the place .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing representations .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
here are two different jets .
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i have it on my laptop . &quot;
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
it &apos;s a whole cool thing .
the difference is then perceived as loss .
in two hours , they &apos;re building up everywhere .
the emergency emergency moved all the strands .
no insurance can create .
there are lots of great books in this topic .
so this was a problem for supercomputer .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
you can predict the predictions . why is that ?
what do i do ?
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
isn &apos;t that half or a quarter ? &quot;
so what can we close from all of this ?
so basically , a translation of translation .
no tree is carbon neutral .
and further , now you see it always .
the next step is now within this communities .
he had invited a lot of natural videos .
this is just the workforce .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so , he &apos;s sitting there . right .
that &apos;s really the greenhouse problem .
and ecological was a catastrophe .
this is one , part of her .
it just wasn &apos;t before , you know ?
in other areas -- the world of communication .
this is my supermarket . no big .
but western governments are also helping themselves .
sleep lack of lack is ubiquitous .
i &apos;m going to be tired like all of us .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
if you burn coal , no .
say , there &apos;s no prediction .
can you play me in blue ?
no , we notice what &apos;s in there .
and there &apos;s a central point .
in fact , everybody &apos;s eaten .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
what are now archaic models ?
and the list can continue to continue .
so that was my primate motivation .
providing america . find more out .
and the problem is not the technology .
it &apos;s the average performance of sleep .
we wondered , and nobody knew it .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s got us in a certain way .
and then it looks like this .
do you remember the winds ?
so , help me do a little bit .
imagine mozart efficiency .
i &apos;m happy that i &apos;m there .
the water &apos;s huge amounts .
they worry about that we &apos;re bad there .
man 3 : i &apos;m the box guy .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a lift pen .
inherently , the instruments have evolved .
i want to explain this a little bit a little bit .
in fact , there was no viral video that was going to do .
in this three-sentence , three sentences come out of it .
three sentence , you still know from school .
you can zoom in very easy and zoom out .
now , i add a bass .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
if you don &apos;t , do somebody else today .
this is the machine below geneva .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
they laughed more than they do here .
your problem is that you have too little .
thirdly , escalation of expectations .
the official dogma of what ?
you just hear them , and then start to speak .
let me show you how they work .
it &apos;s a game called the afternoon .
i call them &quot; the death billion . &quot;
we &apos;re thinking today about energy nappies .
that &apos;s what it is . thank you .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
you go around and you kind of amplify .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
that &apos;s what &apos;s built in the city .
second time . at the end of normal play .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
just imagine that for a moment .
raise your hands . let me see you .
maybe we can see vibrations as change .
dumb is not much better .
people listed . people fighting .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
you know that science is not a company .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so , this really got me around .
i tried to preserve the body .
life had not changed for centuries .
but so many of the years of aid .
my grandmother never left me to live his life .
my fourth technique : predictions for complexity .
the third technique : category .
it summares a thousand square miles .
you &apos;re on two because of it -- very simple .
you should tell me something about my brand .
it was something that we knew to do .
but reality is always unpredictable .
the summer was a happier summer -- 2006 .
donnerist : self-trust is the key .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
i wanted to rebuild health after a disease .
now , if you think about a piece of time .
what ? that really made me go out .
we refer to foods of food .
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
we &apos;ve forced them . puff .
my parents are 80 on the ferences .
and there &apos;s the laughing problem .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drinking information . &quot;
you can jump directly to a particular copy .
you can go into a particular year .
because that &apos;s because it &apos;s done with it , right ?
shake the environment , it needs less energy .
this is what we call osile model .
now you see the dalmatiner .
and the two final ones are here today .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
this has to go down to zero .
but i didn &apos;t let me discourage .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
and at the time , you can react again .
our goal was simple to say , okay .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go again .
all of this is composable .
it &apos;s all in it . it &apos;s useful .
that &apos;s going to be compared to china in a second .
the phosphorus problem is much critical .
in any case , they do that in there .
the permanent ice is red with red .
and if not , dance yet , your dance .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
my mother asked us to touch their hand .
seriously -- the bottom line !
now , this cartoon makes some exceptions .
here &apos;s a few on the hampton .
so this is how the supermarket is .
i thought i could integrate myself .
we still think they &apos;re originally originally .
the three words said , do you remember ?
i remember it was yesterday .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
well , i went to the court room .
i said , &quot; ok , oma . &quot;
we &apos;re in the middle of this overwhelming point .
i work in the solar technology industry .
and let me show you a simple example .
but it has an unexpected waste .
so that made sense , it was fit together .
yet , we seem to be completely satisfied .
we &apos;re more than that , we are citizens .
scott signs of human being .
and here &apos;s a piece of play very well .
it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
is it about the details or the colors ?
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
no one has to give you ecological ideas .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
i think maybe i &apos;ve heard more hands .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
eeeeeee ! no , thank you !
and this is a million-one company .
so at this point , we need digital security systems .
so again , the passengers are really good .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
internality comes in a lot of different forms .
so they put it on ; they save the shoes .
this is about a percent of the population .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years here .
what we want to do is create the future .
i don &apos;t get to the real life of this feedback .
there &apos;s a lot of happy coaching .
let me show you it from the near .
it &apos;s kind of like a potatoes .
commend . damaging .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
they were just like the people in this room .
my grandparents took this number to 70 .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
we need to use more research for more research .
there &apos;s every footprint .
usually i would take the needle out .
there &apos;s somebody who had no childhood .
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
so we would have a machine here .
what do you believe with these design students ?
this will be a key element of this believer .
they live with chemosynthesis .
i was totally excited about science , you know .
now , i &apos;m going to choose government .
and every night they fly 240 miles back .
every morning you fly 240 miles to the farm .
how is the feeding ? &quot;
natural light gives you smarter .
that &apos;s what no one has done in the world .
picasso answered , just wait .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
that the theme of ecology is a globally global .
now i &apos;m going to do something else .
you &apos;re all back to your way back .
and they had to remove what we did .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we just signed down .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
that &apos;s how you can &apos;t get them wrong .
what do you do with certificate ?
this is alfred gonzalez .
there can be a range of changes .
and this is very important in medical research .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
then he told me to the ear .
the rest of the time , they &apos;re deleted .
i start with some simple examples .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
the question is why people accept that .
and i went back to work .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silicon .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
and then i wonder , how could this happen ?
first of all , i thought this was a game .
the storyteller always needs more senses .
and the whole attempt to another generation .
today , a lot of people gave up the government .
next week , the market comes down on the market .
she &apos;s got a button . she &apos;s got a button .
well , it was free day , that &apos;s true .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the performance .
the first is a classic , apple .
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
these things have a positive effect .
no one wanted to do with the film .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
on the left , you see a little boat .
so i think we need to be leaders .
so we have this terrible idea .
so two pairs , every baby .
ladies and gentlemen , their relativity .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
it was probably the imagination beyond the imagination .
the best one is coming -- in a second .
so each concert is a different concert .
so not saving , save , avoid .
and everything is packaged or content .
i could be in front of my house . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
they support other people from their missions .
i put her and made me care of the treatment .
do you know how to call a 4,00th ?
notice two things in this curve .
and i have to say , there was power to me .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
with 16 , i started illustrating books .
that our contribution to the system is voted .
there had to be another piece of lever .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
he &apos;s not coming out in other countries .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
i never want to be a little bit different in life .
so i talked a few months later on a conference .
so they communicate -- this is how they run their fingers along .
i want to show you a little bit here .
and of course , it did , but click .
it was summer , and i had excellent .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
and they &apos;re not only going to die at masses .
what happened is that we could do that .
they don &apos;t invest time in power .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . i sat down .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
anyway . that &apos;s what i want to do every case .
technical circles are the same way .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for 9 .
i put him here in particular .
at the beginning of the tribal society by language .
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
so they &apos;re supposed to come from the outside to the people .
we don &apos;t invent identity ; we invent them .
it was a lot los and i was in eggs .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
now everybody &apos;s trying to see something from this pattern .
he came up to me and got me .
all of them were like that , they started sharing .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
i &apos;m really sorry . does it make you crazy ?
the country on the land would roll them up .
so smartphone , a giant subject everywhere .
and we want to make this material available for everybody .
i &apos;ve learned very simple things in my work .
we want to do something against death penalty companies .
there &apos;s a couple of interesting developments .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet , again , a realistic level .
so the theme of the day : funding .
in fact , no , that was not the mistake at all .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
and we have to do a lot more about this device .
it was born four and a half years ago in italy .
and i say that &apos;s good .
this is a problem that many players have .
the last three of the five , i put together .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
storm this one , lifting the rest .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
well , what &apos;s the marke gerry ?
i want to help you to calm .
both of them are survivors , both zones .
as i said , amanda is our elephant .
there was no cancarpe-gathering melting .
have you taken all your vitamine today ?
so this was a very strange experience .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
we have 20 percent in germany .
everywhere , these windmills are ringing , almost too .
information is a difference that makes a difference .
the only thing they had was their head .
so for him , they were just bloody .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
this is a dead turtle .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
i &apos;ve got something that i want to show you .
how would it be longer to live in good health ?
we don &apos;t want companies to patent .
and that &apos;s what i found unbelievable .
they have reversed the flow of the water .
so , we can &apos;t wear these things at all .
in the countries where people get to money .
and what does it look like in there ?
we understood that the weather is global .
and in this head , the memory was happening .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is a completely unsustainable developmental pattern .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
everybody in my tender neighborhood is gone .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
well , would you choose the same vacation ?
there seems to be a disagreement .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
now she understood the advantage of prototyping .
this is the u.s. for hundreds of years .
i think first is the curiosity .
the flamingos eat the gardens .
these were the first calculations six years ago .
but maybe you can also vote them even more .
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
not everything should be composable .
if you &apos;re in love , efficient ?
and we see that it comes out of paralysis .
because it doesn &apos;t feel real money .
yeah , so what should be biohacking ?
here are some people who test it .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
there &apos;s a lot of spatial .
the corporate headquarters is right here .
i thought he would have done nick stones .
and back to my doctor .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
we want to reduce the number of ugges .
the silence is obey .
the dutch of dna was an interesting step .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
but what happens with &quot; options &quot; is different .
i was not familiar with the eticket .
no apple has ever looked like that again .
good night , sweet threshold . &quot;
now , he &apos;s getting a tractor in the scene .
and you also feel your movements and your movements .
if your job is dance , dance .
so we chose about 50 of the magnets .
these are images about six seconds of six seconds .
but let &apos;s not always be a bad thing .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
they &apos;re becoming rare because we &apos;re going to catch them .
so you don &apos;t often overcome the animals .
all of these are unavoidable .
we have access to exponential tools .
i remember it was yesterday .
and from me , a character is going to be in the book .
tell you , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
so every tribe was a little bit different .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
i put my job on 95 pounds .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i said to my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
we found that it really moves strange .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
the answer will probably be , &quot; no . &quot;
do you know how many people look at this tedtalk ?
because otherwise our problem is even bigger .
this is something like our camping .
that &apos;s how you can get the whole movement .
here &apos;s the results we &apos;ve just got .
but how do you do that in practice ?
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
i want to do it by not die . &quot;
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
that &apos;s not how happy is alive .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
... that also the doses play a role .
probably many of you here are in the hall of this trick .
yes , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s raise that .
and i have all kinds of little paper here .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
well , i understand that . i do that .
marshmallow needs to be on top .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
these blocks don &apos;t bring us a money .
i can make the sequence while they &apos;re running .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
for nathaniel , music means sean health .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
because in fact , this man is not interested in prove .
because we can &apos;t live without these likelihood .
he &apos;s just faking them and not himself .
why do i have to afford such a little car ?
a phrase with his own breath .
over interpretation is barely spoken in the early class .
because the notes are the only connection directly to him .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
it &apos;s kind of a coincidence .
the whole thing is a game , i have to tell you .
or they didn &apos;t have any photo tography .
and all of this leads us to a big question ...
they virtual reality and without computers .
yeah , what do we do now ?
and the world we lived in that way .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
if you put it together , this is what happens .
and that wasn &apos;t hard to diagnose diagnosis .
i was a 20 unbelievable student .
well , really good , maybe an all-star .
wealth , not debt , influenced the result .
she had the last word in every family argument .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we use this word with this deforestation .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and it worked . applause for scott .
i met the decision to pull into the united states .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
and that was an experience of humility for me .
and finally , we should get transparency .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
or are you a download tribe ?
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
so what are we going to see in the film ?
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
i want to tell you how we found that .
and that &apos;s the planning behind it .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
every ice berg has its own individual personality .
you &apos;re not talking about god and nature of god .
how could it be that we do this ?
look , dr. keplan has changed his thinking .
it &apos;s natance , and it &apos;s just natation .
we have the passion of a diy innovators .
this is moore &apos;s law last hundred years .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
we want to create mass content . &quot;
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
now we &apos;re doing this with drills and machines .
this is the news center for service and information .
and we want to put this on a global level .
we have all navigation systems in our cars .
but at the same time , we know that &apos;s not possible .
you knew it was a trick , right ?
well , let me show you something more about it .
here we were , and this is the painting .
emc : &quot; welcome transparency . &quot;
there were a lot of crazy things .
from the bird age to the machine age .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same with disabled movement .
but will we do the best of our game drive ?
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
but one of them is much worse than the other .
but do you know what they don &apos;t have right ?
i thought we &apos;re going to use the powder .
there &apos;s a connection to respect each other .
and so i met a little unusual decision .
so my two passions came up with me .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
i don &apos;t know who you know this picture .
i just agree that this is logical .
i think it &apos;s important to reconcile the one .
the question of death is an interesting question .
the kid in me is really excited about this opportunity .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamics .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
today i &apos;m going to tell you about unexpected discoveries .
the underwater part comes out of a stone .
when i say reality , i mean photo-reality .
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
and how did it be for you ? what &apos;s successful ?
a little bit more about you , not you are .
it was &quot; in eternal , forever . &quot;
tuesday : adaptation is completely overwhelmed .
the dog ! i was loud .
do you want attractive and self-conscious ?
she didn &apos;t breathe and was blue .
the people in the side are coming in now .
but now you can &apos;t count my finger , right ?
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and some of it has worked and maneuverable .
so we walk away , and where do we walk ?
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
we wanted to develop a tool for language learning .
i may have another 40 labor years in me .
now , you know what the answer is on this question ?
if you want to build hyperlinks between the images .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not perceived as big loss .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
this is the kind of curriculum .
and fortunately , there &apos;s a lot of studies now .
and we &apos;re learning to trust and the rules of the game .
probably one of those numbers have to come close to zero .
and i said , &quot; yes , very much . &quot;
you can say things that have influence around the world .
... you could just show the slide short .
just like , i think we &apos;re playing games today .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the need doctor .
and i went over and i just heard about it .
you also show yourself in other places .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
these results were reached by several weeks of hard work .
this player is short before an episode .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
there &apos;s a program that might be familiar with some of you .
i &apos;m very grateful for recommending here .
you probably know that he was in 1835 here .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of it yet .
my mother lifted to nightmares from the boat .
these are the people who form my world view .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the border .
we see this in all possible areas of human life .
and it was also after the three months .
it &apos;s right , morality , patenty .
the main problem here is like aids .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any exception about reality .
there &apos;s a nettable example of this .
then i say , heart failure , yes ?
and we often invent how we want to rebuild .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing kids to the world .
his gangs work has changed after that .
i said , &quot; i promised , oma . &quot;
it &apos;s kind of worthy and strange programs .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is change .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
there are some places that we can apply to us .
we called it the digital water pathelion .
because they have specialized skills of processing .
so here are some natural light bulbs .
the second factor are the services we use .
it changed my way to make films , completely .
it &apos;s hard to overcome the destruction .
so you could feel that you could sell it .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
that means the ants weigh much more than we do .
and we can now look at this .
gee and equals acre cows .
so , go out and start to invent them .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
this is an idea to spread away .
so imagine just two other little changes .
how many would you decide for a good memory ?
and that &apos;s the way the message is .
so please listen to , if a music is played .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any statement about what &apos;s true .
the first two sentences that are logical .
in fact , we know something else is the case .
this should actually not be a joke , but right now .
and then you do that once , and then you experience the sentence .
we can continue these things to play on different examples .
what we love is , the humble thing .
they moved to a natural concept .
so these women met , and they just went .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and we &apos;ve designed an ipap app .
darling and sponsors were saved .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzles .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you zoomed in . you can really go into it .
you can see in all these mutations here .
how much money is needed to reconcile that ?
think about it . this attack is generic .
and if you don &apos;t , you don &apos;t do anything .
so we &apos;re starting with a wind-gram drum .
he says , &quot; go to the conversation . &quot;
imagine a shame airplane .
it &apos;s a completely denial of miserable .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to develop ourselves .
this is another look at the tree of life .
they shared the kingdom in two .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
we had no child paralysis yesterday .
and i &apos;ve used a while to figure this out .
we repeated this practice with the same students .
you have to be ready to take risks like this .
&quot; look at your bones , pink .
there &apos;s no overpopulation problem in trees .
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
and the third area that explains actually from itself .
i &apos;m looking forward to the conversations with all of you .
every big picture is the beginning of a cloth .
you wouldn &apos;t like famine , and you know what ?
or are they more like a downloaded tribe ?
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
this is the consequence that we need to ask ourselves .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
wednesday : you &apos;re in your inner child .
game is the chart that keeps us .
if you have something to give it , you give it now .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
they teach them to open themselves .
antony : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
and here are two patients . these are their records .
i mean , this is a real cognitive view .
i think that &apos;s true for every human being on the planet .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
so , a climate change will be terrible for you .
i just show you the new york times website .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as a designer .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
but the volume are much bigger than ever before .
it grows in winter and shrinking in summer .
not just bad , but the worst of all times .
everybody knew , your genius was something laughing .
we restored them , repair them .
and the world we now look like this .
but these are all roads in the u.s. s.a .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
child mortality has dropped around a tenth .
that &apos;s also where it comes back .
manifest is something that has half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s not an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
and you know what my answer is on all that ?
we walk into the arms of placebo industry .
in the nuclei sector , there are other innovative companies .
where is the biggest interest , so what really do we do ?
and also , the energy source is very important for them .
we went back to the core of titanic .
because artists have a local relationship to lie .
and at all , you have a lot less than i do .
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
i &apos;m never going to play more like this right now .
it &apos;s the form of real behavior , yes ?
and less useless or user friendly is it .
how can i make something more friendly friendly ?
i don &apos;t see why that shouldn &apos;t be that .
so how do we work if we look in there ?
each society is preferred by a primarily medium .
and these interactive portraits are true to each other .
we &apos;re now focusing on top of the fourth generation .
you may have heard that we have built watermarks .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
you get a model that comes from the whole earth .
the grandfather of this old manual .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
so in other words , i first want to do what i want .
and i see the same process in combining photos .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it was nearly 200 million times a year .
they had 348 different kinds of marines .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction to that .
paralysis is a sequence of too many choices .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
he described one of them as very ordinary .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
at a point , the screen is filled with leaves .
so the pydy-movement movement has done it .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
this year it was nearly 50 million times .
but what about this day , this particular day ?
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
we should put the baker in the cage .
are you eight and monthly like 007 ?
the living self has no voice in this election .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
and in the world , everything was a sense of me .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
zip , in a moment of headlines .
you can see almost great for less than 50 dollars .
so gender can come up in many different variants .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
and no , it &apos;s not limited or san francisco .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open you doors ?
here &apos;s the current version of this contract .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
and these were kind of the first people of developed devices .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
they never get a task that they can &apos;t solve .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen so rare lines .
i take this hand . and here &apos;s the knife .
and the movie is called &quot; the ultravital . &quot;
well , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
well , we set up the mayor hole .
now , today we know everything about where our things come from .
france makes a tor . italy makes a tor .
how do you judge people because of their characteristics ?
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressive .
he stays every fifth hope out of my consciousness .
is it affordable for others or is it true to us ?
so i say , let &apos;s start the world changing games !
edward cakinva is a national scientist .
right now , we spend three billion hours per week playing online .
the biggest difference between you is the transition with time .
we tried to get to the automation .
bg : a energy breakthrough is the most important .
and i say , &quot; look , don &apos;t you yourself .
with pivot , they can dive in a decade .
but for many people , this is a little bit too radical .
so i &apos;ve been channeling many fish in my life .
i understood that this is exactly the nature of art .
in reality , the notes are very , very unprecedented .
because we don &apos;t do the things that are free .
there &apos;s a bit more to my glasses .
as i said , it &apos;s only done by two .
this is an interactive trick-filmmaker .
and mooling ! well for you despite the alleviation .
i &apos;m going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and everybody knew that it worked like this , right ?
i &apos;d like to continue to do this work that i love .
and the question is , is that good news or bad news ?
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
here &apos;s &quot; look at your fingers on every light . &quot;
the next step was to find the apps for this .
we know one more than everybody &apos;s announcement .
so you &apos;re just going to the google project .
what other metamorphans did you walk through ?
so we don &apos;t have a budget like others .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
this constant feedback is not in real life .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
a research mester to the theme of user interface design .
i &apos;m also going to solve what &apos;s in there .
you don &apos;t know anything in this goldfish glass . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great dust .
in the future , most crime is going to play online .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
now it &apos;s on the red list of dangerous species .
30 years ago , this was ridiculous .
but i really believe that after us , something else is coming .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of these communities .
the cellular communities started to abstract information again .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
this is great . here &apos;s the digital physicist .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacine .
&quot; don &apos;t go , &quot; it &apos;s untrue .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the brick .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still put together .
also urban designers and designers are very interested in .
there &apos;s not even online . there &apos;s no extent .
it doesn &apos;t work for the memory itself .
our steps in the digital life of life were exponentially .
this is star night , probably never seen this before .
over the course of this discovery , i learned a lot .
as a child , i always drew comic books and so on .
if we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
that &apos;s right now our goal .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
we were just going around like this .
many talk about 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
i was quite recently obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
so when claim says , there &apos;s no soul .
this is the most difficult part in my talk .
i can &apos;t play like this in 20 years .
both of the cases of mine , i sat down .
so much testosterone , but no response to it .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
i &apos;m going to just hold the knife like that .
1m is the highest thing i saw .
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
that &apos;s how to think about the weighs .
these are spaces that can respond to one person .
now , how do people die in such a hack ?
the first story is by charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and you can see this green point there in the middle .
i sold the whole museum in the entire country , all over the world .
this is my meat , and i can turn it around .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
no , that &apos;s the right thing , right ?
many of you are covered by facial expressions .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
in both cases , surgery was surgery , and it was going to be good .
she didn &apos;t have a treaty of brain damage .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
and the fish was also lucky to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
it was the miserable cross against drugs .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
there &apos;s more behind it , it &apos;s still deeper .
but we just know a little bit about where things go .
ok , imagine how extreme self-motivated .
i know what people think when you see that .
ask questions , demand evidence , demand them .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
everything in life is beautiful is not efficient .
this is how it used to happen in the village .
this is what happens so genital machine age .
by the way , there &apos;s a political composition in our country .
they put them on the beatles machine .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental disorder .
she could be able to find out within a time learning framework .
... it &apos;s the crowdsource of crowdsourcing .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
i &apos;ve been working in a coal mining -- dangerous .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there was drunk and he said , that &apos;s what ?
that means to go back to the criminal rates .
so , like a human being goes with certain things .
and of course , as design is measuring influence on perception .
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
it &apos;s just breathly ambitious .
lawyer : i &apos;m a lawyer marke .
we have a abstract abstract language .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
but it was actually a lot of fun in this night .
we had to worry about the lawyers .
it was called the automatically &quot; automatically . &quot;
inotypar is a certificate place .
well , because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
what will they consume ? what are they going to do ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
it slows down for one of our big problems .
we see the process that feeds themselves from themselves .
marker ? yes . alive ? yale .
here &apos;s a short video about what we &apos;re doing .
but you can combine something special like this .
it &apos;s really about combining different realities .
because the images eat it for you to recommend .
so , like , and wling , you &apos;re in this museum .
the idea is to overcome a digital security system .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain it .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is great . i love the placebo industry .
in fact , the advanced society is based on energy advances .
this was not a movie , not a hd that was real .
i wasn &apos;t there for a long time with miguel .
because , you know , that &apos;s a fun process .
have you ever seen a climaneutral tree ?
there &apos;s the same thing that i &apos;ve just described .
if you come far away , go together . &quot;
providing america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
frost , the carbon man will be clean every day .
this is a organism that we described in 1996 .
so i &apos;m going to step back and see another view .
i filmed in war -- difficult and dangerous .
so we should better figure out what the goal is .
we can actually do the same things in fact with less energy .
if we build cities , that &apos;s actually a big thing .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
in other words , play is our adaptation joint .
can you imagine something that comes out of taboak ?
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
you can just call a few names and people will understand .
diphly , tube , child paralysis ...
this is a variation of a thing that was made .
well , the energy source is over time .
and it was an experience that could not give me hollywood .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
it was caused by juggling jews in control space .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a pig .
it &apos;s this beijing , humbling taste .
the gardens eat the physical lankton .
and so he &apos;s flying his elderly circumstances .
and then there &apos;s a whole bunch of simulations .
but it wasn &apos;t like this for years .
the musician is the extension of our body .
he &apos;s only lived in nine-and-a-half years .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
a baby needs about a sixth of wind .
so i know about some who didn &apos;t wear .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be disappeared from here .
it &apos;s like asking someone to stop the sun .
please follow me , because the circle will come back .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s happening here .
this is an icontic debate . she has to stop .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
but then i thought , you know what , we &apos;re honest .
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la ah palma .
&quot; well , these are about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
bruno sanusi : thank you . thank you .
i got a friend who drives a passenger .
it &apos;s not just a nice snowl .
and because we &apos;re older , the wind gets bigger .
this is the period of time you fall in love .
and we &apos;re still very , very strong to stories today .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and the predictions that they read are seriously .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
and i don &apos;t expect to change that ever .
it &apos;s also my great , life-long love and fascination .
and what i was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
why do you get around us if we can &apos;t buy it ?
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
a few years ago , i started to develop lifespans .
they still describe it as untouched .
my grandfather was during the prohibition in prison .
she was a tape , strong woman , she had impact .
so , in a way , we &apos;re going to refuge the technology .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it realistic ?
but what if you want to see the paintings ?
but my logical page didn &apos;t like it .
i just want to say a little bit about salatinian rescue .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . heart happiness .
we also brought litta to design schools .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to prepare against justice .
my uncle died of alcohol disease .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also full of love .
in fact , we &apos;re also one of the majority community .
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
let &apos;s call the animal beginnings , it costs a lot of money .
if a neighbor is helping other people , we &apos;re strengthen supporting our communities .
ohhhhh , wwwwwwww !
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing galleries .
50 percent of their decisions have been hit within nine minutes or less .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and my talk today is maintained by these cognitive actions .
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
open the map , and jump it with a cliff .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a lot about transparency .
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
you could also use ordinary design -- technology to spread .
one of my friends made it -- richard bollingling .
imagine making these imagery really could start flying .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
these are the kinds of questions that we need to face .
i was fascinated by the elephant and beauty of biology .
and i can tell you it was a changing experience .
we need to start changing the real world in a game .
and this is from an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
i mean , how do we touch from our memories ?
the more money you deserve happiness is more .
that our survival is associated with every single one of them .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
and yes , i have a task , as you might recognize .
secondly , the same photos should have compressed photos .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
for example , that somebody who is completely logically logical .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , it sounds interesting . &quot;
yes , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to get out of it .
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of stats .
and the film is going to be made , &quot; the shorter . &quot;
i &apos;m jessi and this is my suitcase .
only that i think it doesn &apos;t like it .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
i hope you &apos;re very excited about this . thank you very much .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why do we fight that ?
these are a lot of toes through masses , 20 an hour .
so there should be better at the beginning of my death rate .
because they are the people who are experts for taste .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
i mentioned this to miguel and he did .
so the more painter , the more the system . &quot;
and then immediately , i &apos;m going to think that &apos;s unfair .
and also , what you would think in the mind today .
and the oil is we &apos;re going to replace through other energy sources .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t do it .
like algae -- and other terrible things .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
it was completely exclusive that it could fail .
so that &apos;s got me right , and i wanted to do more .
and immediately , i see another pattern that gives you a different pattern .
yes , that &apos;s what this looks like down there .
it &apos;s not a resource efficiency , it &apos;s effective .
we &apos;ve now been using over three years .
and if possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the odds .
i now know it was the reason of the sea .
and that was the first time i learned this .
i was looking at woman printer , and she was in breathing .
and the time i collected more and more knowledge .
we &apos;re talking about 300 , if a bat is 300 .
in 2010 , we just had two billion people online .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our census system .
and the lighting away through the rest of the book .
&quot; because she &apos;s been holding it tomorrow today , &quot; he said .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropes .
this is what we &apos;re doing for everything we &apos;re creative .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone here in this audience .
well , you &apos;re not going to be happier .
and the answer is really easy . they are lost forever .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
here &apos;s a picture of an org in kentucky .
he has a feeding of 15 to one .
i can say , the canadian is a man .
we &apos;ve moved to this before , called bird age .
this is 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
this is the audience we just finished recently .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
but you can , if you &apos;re in a foreign foreign foreign .
then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat them good .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t seem to be human .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
or want to be fitter , more power , more power .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though that &apos;s heard .
my great-grandparents died all than they were 60 .
well , where are we going to go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
this is kind of all in the submersible phase .
and of course , it can never give you more in germany . &quot;
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
and the more i talked about , the more i should tell .
and i celebrate , i wonder like a little kid .
obviously , that &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
when you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re pulling other happy people .
players are in spiders in spiders of social nets .
how can we translate these emotions from the reality in reality ?
that &apos;s how it was made out of the same , bad team under the best .
the fact is that this uncertainty should worry about us .
so the people in the west really thought about creativity .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
a sequence of that was that the telephone was never broken .
the more than its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
a few months ago , and i had just forgotten everything .
even who kills someone is not just a murder .
the invention of language was a small step in this direction .
and the next interesting phase was about another billion years .
and this video was actually finished in january .
each of these topics , of course , is from many , many smaller decisions .
there are many others , but i &apos;m missing time .
today i want to tell you about circles and openness .
they &apos;re interacting with their environment and their experiences .
this trick can lead your friends and neighbors . thank you .
you know , there was no mandarin the paradise .
yes , i &apos;m very excited to be there .
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting is the vision of vision .
i apologize that i need to be so strong .
secondly , what economists call an opera scale .
and i think that &apos;s what the world looks like .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
so it has nothing changed , and yet everything has changed .
we have just crossed the 7th annike .
and then let &apos;s put this analogy in the future .
so , if you could do the light again .
it was a store that was called dragger .
are you so far ? you see a little bit nervous .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
the things that are being used are being used in technical systems .
so the device that you see there is not working .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean cosmic technology .
they did that by serving the land .

very rarely , you &apos;re actually going to have a rolling pollination of a wheelchair .
that &apos;s somebody who is sure in the rest of six to 10 .
we &apos;ve used to that things are linear .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black boy than mandela .
they &apos;re in there , they want to go to the end of the gangs .
and then people could eat that , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
because that &apos;s where the actual government is happening .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what &apos;s your weather ? &quot;
and then we started negotiating insulers .
the conventional system looks everywhere in the world .
i &apos;m explaining what these daughters might mean .
that &apos;s why you help with , ask them to ask people .
but also our perception of ourselves , as well as they fake us .
and other example are the ambitious systems , intelligent systems .
how many doors have the house in which they live ?
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells well .

i sent them home without talking to my doctor .
the cost of solar energy last year was 50 percent .
we need to get to the machine agency of government .

it has eyebrows of life , one after another .
and i talked to them to fund an expedition .
we &apos;re talking about the fluctuation of information .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineer of engineering .
that &apos;s the first year , half of his advertisement .
well , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
so they go around and make art installations like this .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
i was shocked and cut down to the inside .
i went home through the emergency department of my way home .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
i say that because i think identity is very important .
because all these new technologies of today are feeding themselves .
because your life depends on whether you did the job right .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
i knew she had come up to give up .

a typical walmart gives you 100,000 products today .

what would you like to do if you could only have one ?
again , what potential would we want to call , because now ?
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epiphany game .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , two reasons .
if we looked at how feelings interact with income .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
there was no christmas trees . we did it all .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health care system is .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
look at guel , farmers like miguel .
the more you heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals ?
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not so sure .
makes it impossible to say how the photo was actually collapsed .
the words , so long his friends , motquito his .
and we found that there was actually a context .
do you know how many decisions do you make in a typical day ?
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
so the driving force behind it is cycles -- superpower .
i didn &apos;t spend two years with my wife anymore .
the pilot took the machine after the hudson river river .

it turns out that dna synthetic synthetic is very difficult .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we think about our future as a predictable memories .
well , the memory itself is a storyteller .
what it had been ruined was the memories of experience .

there &apos;s a vacuum adolescence there .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
a fish up , but also a bird reserve .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of history .
this first one , which was more like a passionate monkey .
he &apos;s very happy about it , because he faked it .
because the music is a language , and it &apos;s a language to communicate .
and the first time is to ask questions about what &apos;s the right thing .
but i &apos;m going to do it just a little bit more curious .
i started thinking , i should just put the project out .
we can , of course , look at the waste problem .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of platform .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take you away .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
just to precise newspapers , they agree with them .
if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
so you can ask : how happy is the living self ?
most of them will be completely ignored by the memory itself .
please don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have any consequences .
has a single one in the audience ever seen somebody at masses ?
it &apos;s the question of whether you can get this on zero .
you want to test it after my talk in your rooms .
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum of many ideas .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
so , in every store , you can get the things back .

you have to make 62 different decisions to design your car completely .
well , don &apos;t understand me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just like that .
almost as if we were prepared for our lives .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my ego space .
i was the only one who could talk to the airplanes .
so the records were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
think of this as a screen , as a flying point .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
this is a fascinating adventure where you go .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the coming years .

there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe this is an artificial kind of way to read a book .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will only be worse .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
because by marine protected areas , we &apos;re basically going back to the past .
i want to end with a story that really excited me .
sometimes i lose the equilibrium . a story to the end .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
so we &apos;ve removed the timeline again .
so today , evolution can happen in the time of microseconds .
this is what he hears a rare calendar .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
we could , of course , reduce 10 percent , but what does that do ?
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
car colors , outside of the cars -- i have 56 options .

i really like your kind of , sergey brin . now .
i became a miracle that was not going to die on this day .
it &apos;s called eyemen and you can see the description .
this is the average size of a greenland iceberg .
i mean , what does somebody do with so many outlets ?
and as general term , we can use the word interactive sexual sexuality .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
we all need to believe in the last thing that we can &apos;t see .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , it &apos;s called miguel .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to do first .
and then the same thing happens in a good , speaker conversation .
i have to tell you : i think that was a big mistake .
we take pictures of this mini-button in detectors .
economists call this a parallel improvement .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
the way to maximize is to maximize choice .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
this is a whole book , an example of non-visual data .
and of course , we all share the same adaptation .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the fatar .
there are accidents in front of us , like the inootar .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just coming out of our heads .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
because frankly , every project has his own marshmallow .
ceos are something about average . but here &apos;s interesting .
because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of opinion .
here &apos;s one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
this deputy puty ran over the older black black .
i don &apos;t know how emphasis people will be .
you &apos;re about the block and you take it as an openness .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the pace room .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees of our next living relatives .
the first one of these is an aspiracy , complexity .
they invest a lot of their time in building growing growing growing growing structures .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , as little as the supporters are supported .
usually you &apos;re just sitting there , and some people don &apos;t .
now he mentioned the mineral needs of physical lankton .
i take this breathing to the audience , conscious or unconsciously .
you feel that &apos;s the real truth behind the origins .
but the question i want to throw out is : why not ?
and the best part of this is perhaps what we expect in health .
this is technology support innovation that has today .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
wr is to help people who have been convicted .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
how did he come to look at this kind of special kind of help ?
let &apos;s jump fast to moma , again in new york .
tempt is going to be part of the show , which is pretty defeated .
we produce androgene , and we &apos;re talking about androgenes .
and if you make it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this is scandalous , and we should estimate ourselves .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple practice .
but while they talked to different people in this world about these possibilities .
now , this is a renewable energy percentage of five percent .
and they did this with so-called lead-maps maps .
but crucial is when i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so i was busy working on when what is natural or intuitive .
and this is just the biohacker , the individual people .
it means that we &apos;re reaching a cultural impact next to scientific science .
this has struck me when i wanted my jeans .
he invited the king of sisters to dinner .
but somehow , we create it from this problem .
and that &apos;s also what i had in the last half-year .
but instead of asked in panic , he just stopped .
how about both tears that we can &apos;t even predict ?
if you look at people who they have to do it ...
and guess what we found in the angular code ?
imagine that every single one of people is controlled .
okay , let me get a little blood for you .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
new investments to create good jobs .
six : social case . speaker 7 : 65 dead .
and i hope you &apos;re going to play with me like this and play .
and that means that the players are sure that the player is safe by 10 beds .
a long time ago , there was grawale -- 500 years ago .
in many of you will say , those are crazy ! that &apos;s good .
the x interpretation of a piece of a piece is this comparable .
from my eye angle , i saw the masters and go down .
light bulbs in a glass , i always found very exciting .
for example , this picture has about 10 billion points , i think .
so i decided that when i was 15 , diver .
here &apos;s what i do . we look at it right here in the center .
and within less years , lego moved in every household .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
by the way , i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a lawyer .
and i &apos;d like to show you my output for this week .
56 percent of all rape accidents don &apos;t come in front of us .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-replicating .
i asked him how he became a fish experts .
there was the nuclear research facilitatoes .
from that time , an anecdote that you might know .
it doesn &apos;t need to whistle a whistle or sing .
and seal 10 milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
this goes back to a lot of back , in the cultures of industrial times .
so i think it &apos;s a very yellow hack .
i think kind of , like , you know , shit or something like that .
this actually took two thousand really form , really , this networks .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
so , this looks like a basketball plaque .
and , if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i didn &apos;t leave me .
well , in fact , the number of violence has not changed very much .
i first ate him in a restaurant in south spain .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity , from our humanity .

alone this airport has a surface of 100 square kilometers .
i like things that are special . i like special things .
this is my brand in my little , broken industry .
so maybe you should put a little bit on this interview . &quot;
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leaders .
here you see a section from this angular code -- code .
we &apos;ve got his bed to see it outside .
we degrade a person who has value for our society .
we &apos;re doing games to get the suffering of the real world .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have a trust system .
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : it &apos;s .
the secret is that the game of the key is to these skills .
this is actually the real melting of human and machine .
some . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
they produced the highest construction in the world .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons of tons on the planet .
i grew up with a caves of science fiction .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building siv , not intensive .
so here was finally a company trying to do it right .
the component is becoming more to the friend , with which you live together .
and i &apos;m not sure if they &apos;re really going to stay egg .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can do a little bit of a little flight .
there was , in my opinion , a very good code .
in fact , nasa showed that there are many of them out there .
they like to increase the paralysis and their satisfaction .
now , i wondered how can i really get this over ?
it &apos;s an independent area . you &apos;re controlling all minerals .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view .
someone was broken and had founded the system .
photos like this : a construction station along a lot of bicycle .
the biggest fear they had , raped and death and death .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to get all of these extensions .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange landscape .
but this time , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
i brought down some submits , and that &apos;s all .
but a lot of people are caught in a very strange position .
our gut is a wonderful friendly friendly environment for these bacteria .
well , the two species of self throw two terms of happiness .
well , life itself lives its life continuously .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness in research .
it &apos;s just a bloody calories . it &apos;s mimic .
the modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
ah , the majority . i like to see as a doctor .
my inspiration comes from a event , which is 2,500 years back .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
smallpox . the smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
it &apos;s the renewables that they &apos;re often called .
this is a fish up in the southwestern corner of spain .
so , as i ask , how do you know , is this diagnosis ?
the notified notes have the function of the letters of a writing .
then these are randalities of the pre-industrial cultures .
that means you &apos;re navigating sound about sound and rhythm .
so this is just a application of many that you can do with it .
and then we &apos;ve been working as a cost-like cooperation .
on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to lhc .
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
that &apos;s what we call perceptual design .
54 percent of the deaths of deaths went through drilling .
essentially , the concrete farmer became the building block of our time .
how about a new sentence , never agreed to vote before .
how can a judge someone turn into something that he &apos;s not ?
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lyncs .
so programs that can do the fastest nucleus .
for example , the fish had been taken on a glorious flight .
possibilities that wouldn &apos;t have been allowed , have been encouraged .
so i took a few years ago to do that .
finally , when we &apos;re supposed to write the fear of welcome .
an eighty , it was marke . how is your brand ?
why is it important to start ? what represents red ?
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely limited by constraints .
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
well , in this night , everybody went to celebrate to celebrate .
and the key indicator of india is the extinction of languages .
and i had to explain the journalists that there is no test .
and that &apos;s called androgenreceptor defeat .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative thinking , heart creature .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a ph.d. .
at the moment , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
and soon , i wrote an article about genetic food .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
so i offered a $ 100,000 price to software for the winner .
one day this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a beautiful one .
there was no piano at all .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
even if you were to shoot now , you would have emissions .
most of you know most people know this from the software industry .
this is actually live in the internet . you can test it .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nunting .
but nothing was invented that would let me go again until now .
and the best part is that they connect with magnets together .
some of my claws were passive in the last five years .
i looked in the radar , and it was a little bit of pink .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular pitch .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
so the dramatic numbers come to the prisoners .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany over the death penalty .
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkeys . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
this is my wlancage . a very simple thing .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
what &apos;s the relationship about the thoughts and feelings of themselves ?
and if those are dangerous , things can happen really bad things .
and this urgency , this goal , has changed my life .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
if we don &apos;t take a phosphorus and give it up .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the magical thing for me .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours per minute , they &apos;re invited to a minute .
if you could do it for the ones , you could help me .
and it just disappears all these companies , one after the other .
i &apos;m sad that we never know each other as adults .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one of us deserves on it .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of individual alism .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individual alism .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go to the house .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
specialized skills and processing skills and their combinations lead to success .
people here have contributed to the development of this miracle .
and somehow , we need to bring changes that down to zero .
we find other odds of what their rights are .
this is the period of most perceptions that we have .
this is our youngest taster on the bottom right .
by the end of march , the lhc will be more functional .
and that &apos;s the message that i took in medical school .
do you know how to call a 3000-year-old league baseball ?

my friends from honduras asked me to say , thank ted .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
well , finally , the film has a very big wait for him .
this is actually just a period of two and a half weeks .
these people will be connected to the film in forever -- always for .
so all these green areas , these are the most diverse environments .
one is called jazz , and the other is called &quot; peace . &quot;
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of god being able to virtual about it .
i went to the car and was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
in the short time here , one of me was clear : ted has a identity .
she said , &quot; this will be very , very tired . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good intuition to actually do the experiments .
in my opinion , mass extinction has changed our world a fundamental way .
this is all reality today , and in the future , it &apos;s going to be much more possible .

here it says , the more you brush , the better .
people said , are you not afraid to have success ?
i don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with it .
and what i learned is that error is absolutely unbelievable .
i love this : &quot; watson beds human enemy . &quot;
i looked at her and smile , but she looked very seriously .
three months later , i was moved , and the adventure went on .
it &apos;s about getting out of kiss to be overflow .
i like a lot of black colors , lots of gray sounds and such a stuff .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impulse for the flydary .
and the question was : how could you combine technology , new technology with it ?
for example , i don &apos;t want to give you the same rights like a human .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast .
i played the first sentence of beethovens .
the man is supposed to have from monkeys or have a common ancestor .
and loud signs , f and b , cetera .
how were his living circumstances , how are the society and politics ?

and when i heard her , she made her keen sounds .
and i was good , i took cup to claude .
but when i ask you , how do you do with your wife ?
you collect information about the piece in the secular literature .
there &apos;s a lot of people working there in there , and they can all be engaged .
but how would it be if you linked this image with all your images ?
you say that you will never forget the names of dying .
but it does something that doesn &apos;t do any other regional technology .
because the categories tell me how i can hold them apart .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
we should be able to rotate everything we want .
and i tend to see wits as my shadow .
so studies have been conducted to see if that &apos;s true .
there you can see , which is enormous resolution .
that comes from asia , in which all of japan comes from japan .
because a good engineer has built either great cars or nuclear power plants .
this was the first beginning of a musical printer .
you can only have nuclear missions when you &apos;re not there .
it &apos;s good . the question is , how will it go to us .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
official faith of all western industrialized societies .
&quot; do you remember the patient you met at home ? &quot;
we live on a planet where 70 percent is covered with water .
but just give them the construction of apartments against cities .
because that &apos;s how you lie that logic , you can just apply it wrong .
often , music class is so that you learn to read the notes .
that &apos;s just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
eight : tsunami warning . cyber : cyberattacks
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
bruno guisi : mark , mark , come back .
just when it doesn &apos;t seem hardly , the game may be necessary .
so we don &apos;t have to control people to be bad for being bad .
now there &apos;s all of this rumbber , before the big devastating .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
they knew jewelry and byproduct that they had to attack .
it was as italy won the football world championship .
in our views , we went into all sorts of uninconvenient areas .
and she was much worse for a than b in memory .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who has more licensed ? &quot;
we &apos;re not just telling stories about telling us stories .
a deception is going to be a little bit more , because somebody &apos;s going to perceive it .
why ? because we don &apos;t have child paralysis . and you know what ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
if i haven &apos;t right , the cancers is not a man .

so in other words , the future has gone around a year since i &apos;ve been on this world .
they shoot the decision -- they shoot them , even if they &apos;re interested in their own best interest .
so these are things to do -- you know , people remember -- this is kind of why we &apos;re interested in .

as you &apos;re fortunate to be very different from how you think and whether you think about the memory itself , or whether you think about life itself .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a mammal -- they bury them without the complex .
we &apos;re going to turn it off , and expect the first data in june or juli , and put our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
we want to create the world of creation , the inventor of the inventors , because this world , in which we live , this interactive world , we hear us .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease and 1.3 percent of the health workers .
so i decided to visit the filia day of filiter , and i asked the head , &quot; this model works that they really offer all these opportunities ? &quot;
the head of congress came to the stage and said , &quot; professor romer , i thank you for your talk , but maybe we might look at tedtalk .
we have to do this substance , and we need to think about it , but if we go to the time machine and go into the future , we will be happy to have done that .
so i stood back with a small team on unknown terrain , and we drew &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that had not been before .
and then we don &apos;t have the commitment , but that &apos;s wait , i think it &apos;s relatively good , that people are really convinced about this .
i mean , it can be strange to think about that a thing is at the same time in two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they developed them .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is what it takes us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; -- to a potato moment .
but the measures were very beautiful . and people in my company told me that we &apos;re not going to be able to be able to do that .
i was a seventh at the time when i went back to one of his courses once , and i played the last of the four balchoppers in a chart .
if your job was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at everything for you , everybody knew you had this body genius , which helped you .
on nine people that we &apos;ve been executed , one that we have for innovate , who has been disappointed and made out of death .
so an organism could learn , for example , a certain fruit doesn &apos;t eat a certain fruit , because they made it bad and sick , the last time he ate them .
personally , it &apos;s easier to create a place than find a place , because you don &apos;t have to go in with the ideas in your head .
it &apos;s about how to encounter people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media , so that they can create a peaceful experience .
finally , this elderly black man came with a very concerned face in the court room and sat down behind me , almost on the defense bank .
there &apos;s this airplane of hundreds of thousands of small parts that are working together to make their safe flight . do you don &apos;t think that &apos;s visible ? &quot;
one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; thylacine in my head . can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s dead .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults as adults , i learned , she was related to a box and was put into my hands .
we &apos;re going to have a process that might end up in the rule of maybe 100,000 years , and we can combine it on a thousand years -- and maybe even on the next 100 years .
there &apos;s a series of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-oh moments than others , and under the worst frozen whales .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to see , we &apos;re going to see before we see it back in the back of the back of our yeast , to say , okay , okay .
his job is to create the conditions that exist less than a billionth of the universe at the beginning of the universe -- and the until 600 million times within a second .
but they also have a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to increasingly challenges , larger creativity and print .
and a lot of discussions that i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had in the last three years of photovoltaics .
a sailing pencil , if you have the power of water , you have enough pressure , so i think , four to six to sixtless things .
and what happened to me , which was what happened to jacques cousteau of sensation , which was the idea of a totally unknown world here in our earth .
and our european connected web is basically just made out of louder mammals of large power , where the wave is all around europe .
a process that has -- like everyone who has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , in fact , everybody here -- is not always reasonable .
and every year we ask the students to create products and services and services that can live within a decade , within a decade , the lives of millennia of people .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think a lot of you have understood that the moral penalty of the universe is far beyond the universe , but it &apos;s increasing justice .
and finally , samples : a unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world to tell you something about a word without saying a word .
they didn &apos;t count because he was locked with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had to keep him .
i think the molecular biology in general , so general , i &apos;m talking about , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
how about the bottom line , wherever they are , to give a voice to make attention and make change , for the first time ?
i love to find any opportunity to find a different colorful , crazy outskirt , and at the last time to photograph and photograph .
i used to say , whenever a human being used in a moral legacy , because we should try to replace it by words .
and it turns out that when you make it feel that something is concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people more .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for preserving people we love to preserve sales , but they also prefer to get very well .
so we take something very complicated , turn it into daughters , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads .
no , it just looks a lot better than we show that we are constantly involved in creating the dangers that make others when they just fire .
now , in egyptians , the rise of april in april 2011 , the headquarters of egyptian secretary of egyptian police , and they found a lot of actors .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of programming work , zero-cup and lots of parties , recorded by tony , tony signed for the first time after seven years .
so that &apos;s what this reactor was a problem that we fill in our fill , and that &apos;s going to reduce the waste volume during this process .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we have digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new phase of biology by building new lives and building new lives .
but this is what i &apos;m going to stop at night -- one of the things i &apos;m holding at night , and we &apos;ve never had scientific progress as well as now .
according to burron , the front of january in january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls from this film .
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate at the moment , to build the coal force , because we &apos;re not yet , or gains , because it &apos;s not a pig , because it &apos;s not going to happen .
a lot of our friends thought we were beautiful to do that , and that we were back and checking all the images on the walls would be the graffiti .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake were only passive in the first five years of passions , which is a lot of my colleagues , but total nonsense .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government who pay taxes and services .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very , very explicit center , at least , at least he was really exclusive .
in a country that has just been behind a devastating crisis in which congress was elected for this fiber change with 124 / 24 voice .
it seems like we were quite abandoned by the other parts of life , but actually the biggest part of the life , are the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are pretty much the same .
but the logic of disappointment allows us to do it as if the first sentence of premice had to be wrong , as if you had to think of it without evidence .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert when i have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been working so long as i &apos;m going to see how i &apos;m going to experience .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up to my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing , you &apos;re listening to this . &quot;
well , there &apos;s marvelous and eighty marks , these things that come and go , but one night , marke marke is a pretty strong thing .
and if you &apos;ve already got that the drugs of stuffing complex complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the data is a science for yourself .
if i tell you that somebody &apos;s life has eight on a scale of 10 to 10 dollars , they have lots of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self .
well , i did a couple of people in the company , no one could give me an awful answer , until i finally got the quiet biologists .
basically you get every round of each six-word randomly random letters , and while you &apos;re trying to form words , these words are examined about a dictionary .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot of well-being , or maybe a little less likely to talk to you about it .
but then another thing happened , very interesting step , where things were completely different . because these cells began to communicate and exchange information , so that communities came from cells .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference , we say , in climate .
they start out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything they see is fluid channels , and these density , margins .
we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to make us the big challenges of our planet .
so a apple that is written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spread from rare , is a kind of shell in front of the institution of the government .
what that means is that if you hit someone and you would tell you , oh , his father is a two-me-me-man , how much would you know about its size ?

as it would feel , in a world of life , in the german state of people , especially when unprecedented families were a lot of youth .
and because the government ultimately lifted their power from us -- remember , &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- -- how do we think about it , how does this change happen .

and since we give us the media campus , for example , the virtual reality in our v.r.r.r. lab , we can actually do this all the time .
i was talking to you , you know , you &apos;re doing this thing , and you both know , if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because it makes as much sense of everything that i heard about when it was about to explain the absolutely crazy kind of creative processing of creative processes .
so it &apos;s just as far . and for all of those who were not there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that has ever been listed 27 kilometers -- in the diameter .
and i &apos;ve argued that we might be able to create a new form of campus explosion in which there could be massive new education based on this digital design .
the reason is that it used to be better than everything was worse than everything was worse , it was possible for people to make a pleasant surprise .
and i used to deal with me that if i doubled my efforts to have a perfect mistake , and never again , that the voice could hurt .
so this is just a few of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could be the last six days , or the last six years .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i had several months to plan them to find the different places for the pieces of the box .

you &apos;ve got to imagine that if you make something of the classic creature , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , just an hour .
i &apos;m a wall . i have to work in a day , i have to stand up every day at the same time and sweat me , and i &apos;m really unpleasant .
so they found , according to herototus , the worm game and agreed a national strategy , and one day you would eat food . the next day you would play .
the other note is that we &apos;re using the zero-sum emissions , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
the studio , i &apos;ve got this as &quot; romeo and julia on a ship , &quot; it &apos;s been sold a film , a passionate film , a passionate film .
now , in discussions , these insula landers are trying to do themselves , they have a small web that has a small web that has nothing to do with our connected and nothing .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hallin in berlin , in which we could sort of form the electric capacity of the island in the scale of one in three .
that means the interpret has to interpret this unprecedented language of notation in another , namable , concrete , non-verbal music language .
it &apos;s not really intuitive for apple to make a fundamental factor of economic factor , elementary factor of success , if i want to use technological devices to use people .

now , what i hear is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormone culture , monoculture , we don &apos;t want huge fields with a thing that &apos;s wrong .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them to play some kind of game to control their health better .
and imagine i &apos;ve even been a five-year-old child with dr. p.p. and so trying to stop these practices , natural success without success .
bg : well , the actual output for research -- say , we should spend the u.s. 10 billion a year more than you do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatically .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that lets us explore and interact , and the unexpectations that we form , are the real nutrients of creativity .
and there was no video games or these super-generated video filming nor the whole imaging language in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
as you knew in the village at the time , who has done what &apos;s happening with whales and when this is what &apos;s happening today about this expanding of our expanding ourselves through these mobile devices in globally globally .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility that i was so handful , and so i would be able to help my patients without contact him .
i got a pencil , because i &apos;m not on the bike , but there &apos;s a lot of disabilities that don &apos;t let you go to the bike .
and so i look at one of the people in common with most experimental quantum physics , who need a good level of logic to add the complex ideas together .
if we look at a founder of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream of a solution .
jacques cousteau came to our living room with his fascinating sensations that gave us animals and places and a world full of wonder that we could never imagine before .
and if we were paralyzed , of course , we were able to do this , for nike , for nike and mauritz and the whole textile industry .

the second one is a sense of experience and memory : basically , you &apos;re happy in your life and happy about his life or happy life or happy with his life .
you go into this capsule , you fall in these dark , dark surrounds , where there &apos;s no hope for rescue , if you don &apos;t make it back .
so , you also notice that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s just to get from this absence , which is to be a hundred percent renewable .
it was priced in the cell , and the other chromosome as a stranger of the material , and so we only had a cell with a new chromosome .
and these scientists have just documented the different themes with which these ceo works , and how much time they make decisions that include the topics .
all of you think i was between titanic and &quot; avatar , &quot; and &quot; avatar dawning , and i would have been celebrated somewhere on a towel on the beach .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this story is how romantic romantic is still , too .

and if you drive the speed of this rotator , you &apos;re actually able to put the rotor into the rotor , and finally , the centrifuge explode .
it &apos;s the living self , the doctor &apos;s primary -- you know , if the doctor asked , &quot; now , if i &apos;m going to clarify you here ? &quot;
now , when we go on and go to old animals , we say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are even the main tower thing about people who are supposed to worry about .
we should call them what she is , a commercial , a commercial capital that makes the ecological capital that allows them to do exactly the production .
we &apos;re going to study whether we can use carbon co2 that could just be brought to productivity , constrained carbon in fuel to drive this process .
so when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
when people take this seriously seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything on your head , everything we believe , for example , in terms of tax politics and so on .

since i &apos;m going to have more life expectancy than today , and so on my palette of music , there &apos;s a lot more color of color nucleaners , emotions and emotions than today .
they &apos;re also involved in such an artistic aspect of biological materials , yes , electronics , and also combined electronics , and combining it in a pretty different way .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat oceans , is so fascinating in the fascinating life of what we can &apos;t really imagine .
and then the kind of semantic connection and the feet that comes out of it is really enormous . there &apos;s a classic network effect .

and then we set up a v.r. burning burning and burst the burning of the laser smoke and then tried to focus on this camera .
of course , the chance of randomly instructions are very small that they &apos;re going to be able to do nuclear animals , so they &apos;re not going to make an instructions .
that means , instead of remembering individually , we have standardized degraded , common patterns of memories that we can hang our personal memories .
and yet , the burning of cooperation is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkable value of clean coal that you see here , everything .

we see a lot , many gigabytes on digital photos here that you &apos;re looking at , and you &apos;re going to move forward and move forward , and you can remove around in a new way .
this tribe , the cofan , have 17 variables on ayayahuca , which you all recognize in the forest in the forest , for our eyes as a kind of way .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept of advertising is your product as many people as possible , as many people as possible .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the apartment that you have in front of each other , because you have a task that you can explain to another .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have been traveling to this distance of earth , to realize they &apos;re not even removed .
that our system also has a price increase , it &apos;s because we &apos;re still doing 20 percent with el , and we also do a price increase in the other things .
we &apos;ve only spent two years of phosphorus , and now , through the phosphorus mining mining around the world a lot more uranium in the environment than in all atomic facilities .
we propose that in 10 years , the absence of civil rights is going to be as high as the favor of voting the election of the election .
and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s grown up on the internet , and the white knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the systems right .
and so far beyond the isolation , when we &apos;re talking about as a species of planets , there will be obesity and changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
i learned a lot about science . but i certainly think you have to have to do a shelf director , a leader like a shipping cap or so .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species and converted completely into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
well , i hope that you agree with me that the players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
now , everybody &apos;s going to take these randomly instructions of instructions , all leaders from programs , and finally , those who are the ones that i &apos;m going to give . &quot;

but it was a pretty abstract discussion where there was a break when there was a break , octavio said , &quot; paul , we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
but for two weeks , we have programmed , we went to the strandroid in venice , my kids were raised , my dog , and we created this .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the old greek historic historians , you may know this story . the story about why games were invented .
but i think , in this framework , and with the intention , from a deception to something real , i &apos;m going to just let the needle in there , and so from the stage .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try to try and look at things , whether it works , if it doesn &apos;t do that , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
a lot of arguments against fish pollution , most of them , and they are inefficient , we take a big part of it .
and because they work much harder than we and because they &apos;re only three to six months , they &apos;re talking to their weight , in energy consumption , a little bit less than 30 billion people .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and all the miserable health care system , you know , there &apos;s no more left .
i think that the remarkable of the failed last few years , the last decade is that we are transformed by a physical world to a digital world .
so gender is really complicated ; sexy is not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in certain ways , you can be distributed across the entire bandwidth .
and by the way , we go to the circles and the district and we mix so much that they can &apos;t say longer , that isolation is necessary for evolution , for evolution .
of course , the stories i was looking for , from the scienarian experience : terminator , &quot; terminator , &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
and in this scenario , you can imagine that in a case , the sperm is a chomosom that hits the chromosome of the chromosome .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive , to survive and to survive , from the fight of the human spirit , is determined by conflicts .

they believed that creativity was a kind of divine spirit , which was from a distance , unknown source of people -- from unknown , unknown reasons .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing marketing for writing drugs for people like you and me , if you think about it , no sense at all , because we don &apos;t buy it .
armstrong twisted about us and then , in december , we taught us the time-magazine when one of the 50 best inventions of 2010 , which was really great .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people use things that we design .
they were the idea that people who had political power should have , these political power should have , because of the bloodline of the grandfather of grandfather to the grandfather and so on .
i &apos;ve taken some people &apos;s number of books that were published with &quot; title &quot; in the title of the last five years , and they gave them about 40 , and there were still a lot more .

the other hut that i &apos;ve been wearing in my work is the activist , as an interior lawyer lawyer -- or as i say , sometimes as an impatient lawyer -- people who are doctors of doctors .
a couple of years ago , i went to the city where i was growing , in a food market in this red market , &quot; in the northeast zone of pennsylvania , and i was standing there in front of a printing tomatomato .

most women , as i think -- i think a typical woman -- i know my actual chromosomes , but i don &apos;t think i probably have the typical ones -- most women like i actually talk about androids .
if you allow somebody to activate his own inner forces -- the human mind is so recommend -- if you create this , and you open to somebody in a key moment , then you &apos;re a very good teacher .
that &apos;s what you &apos;ve found was that by talking to a common language , you could communicate with each other , in the same caves , or in other areas , cities , or villages or villages , and so you &apos;ve created messages in a way .
we need solutions , either one or several of the unprecedented tasks and unimaginable forces , and even though there are many directions in which people look for after that , i see only five of those big demands can afford .
now , when i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of these are regimes , some of the science . some of the science . some of the things , some less , come from economy . here &apos;s my chef . and one comes out of the music .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology and i &apos;ve been working on a few years of biohacking , and i &apos;ve just started to understand , because i just wanted to know , and i wanted to do it as well as i learned in the study of theoretical theories .
and i left the medical school with the impression that i knew if i knew everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as possible as possible as possible , as possible as i could do , that i was wrong with the wrong thing .
and then , if i go to a step further , in these tribes , where i &apos;m a voice , language , language , trigger , and i don &apos;t have to do more mouse and mouse things that have to tape , then i &apos;m faster and even faster .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been doing now , in fact , that they don &apos;t recognize more patterns in there , but i have digitized them within a short time , and again , to see this dog back into this picture .
in fact , when i turn my hand away from you , so you can see it from the back , this finger here , my finger , just from where it was , in a position where it was so exposed .
not to burn the enlightenment a little bit better to burn it , and to put it in the fuel , to lose the materials for circles for circles , but first time , how do you make questions ?
the first thing that i saw was this idea that their brand personal personality had two separations , but errors got pages of pages -- the morgan spurine marks is an eighth of march .
in other services , like the fertilizer of fertilizers , 105 : 55 : 56 -- up to 05 : 55 : 55 : 85 : 855 or aeries or air travel , it &apos;s a lot of improvement for very small improvement .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is , if i &apos;m looking at things , i can make them confusing them confusing on the right side , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salz and p.m. , or i can make them intuitively intuitively by showing things .
because it turns out that it turns out , if you offer a placebo in a white mushroom , in the form of an aspiration , it &apos;s just a healthy , white pill that has a particular measured effect .
the kohler evolution has the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a nuclear waste in the 20th century , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerator refrigerators , climate change , we can create modern materials and so many things .
we took the light out , we put it in a vacuum and clean air and cooled it all the air up and cooled it up to almost to the rest of the day alone , it was the piece of metal that metal was free to behave , like it always wanted .

together , the inherent cultures of the world are creating a web of spiritual and cultural life , which is the earth , and probably the earth is as important as the earth is as important as the biological life of life , which you know as biosphere .
so , for example , if you take this child in the west of the amazon amazon , the people of the anaconda , believe that mythologically were coming from the middle east to the fall of the trees .
some bacteria have found out how they can stay from penicillin and have these information together with other bacteria in the dna , and now we &apos;ve written a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because bacteria communicate with each other .
and i want to say something that is a very radical thing for a feminist , and i think there might be different kinds of insight that might be given by different kinds of atomic anatomy , especially when people think of a group .
now let me introduce you to the election of amanda boxy that &apos;s been carried a recurring back 19 years ago , which was the result that she couldn &apos;t run anymore for 19 years and now .
something interesting happened in &quot; abyss , &quot; to solve a narrative problem in this movie -- and we had to create a kind of liquid water creature -- flu , flu , we regenerated into computer animation , cage .
and dr. keplan said , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that children , if they don &apos;t get anything else , and even if they get a little support , if you get kids to overcome themselves , you can get very much children . &quot;
when we get to these right big stages -- over 100,000 base pairs -- they &apos;re not just growing in ecoli . it &apos;s going to grow all sorts of ways of modern molecular biology , and that &apos;s how we change other mechanisms .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an outsider , a new cheese , new image -- and not just okay , but something that you have to be grateful , maybe a gift of the boarding .
and so , i think , from the city , a very different view , a very different impression , which is that i see negative and positive religions of a city and in this way , in a way , a very different virtual map of a very real city .
but this is the most magnetic thing that can happen , because this is the group of groups , groups that can help patients to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could reduce the patient &apos;s smooth .
as i said , i &apos;ve been giving myself a few years in some pretty horrible situations , but nothing could be prepared me , nothing could give me something so difficult and dangerous as with these guys in a room .
and that &apos;s very amazing because you actually believe that this high-tech technology that you &apos;re going to see is that there &apos;s actually one in the future , but it &apos;s actually so that the future is right at us , in our archaic roots .
and because i was born without dennis legs , and my feet had gone to you , and i just had a few toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , he was the bridge that strangers had to kill the bad news .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was talking about 20 years ago when i first told me that i was going to be a writing writer , i wanted to be the same kind of anxiety .
if we &apos;re in a game world , i think a lot of us are changing in our best version , and we &apos;re currently ready to be willing to solve the problem , to try to solve the problem , as long as long as it needs to try to do .
and because i just think of one of these little devices , because the things are always going to be intuitively intuitive , more natural , more natural friendly , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually for us , of course , what &apos;s used to be friendly friendly or intuitive .
do you don &apos;t fear that you live your work for a long time , and you never make something out of it , and that you &apos;re going to die on a rose of rotating dreams -- your mouth is filled with the bitter of the bitter ?
and if i take another half-boss , we don &apos;t even see a unit , which is circle , circle circle , and we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a circle , a different circle .
they raised these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see the face or the character , and they didn &apos;t find anything , and conclusion that this was the devastating cards of the devil , and the five mixed missions with the spears .
i &apos;ve always been writing my synthetic dictionary , but i was working with the work of the texting , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never been in my life , which is what really means &quot; disabled . &quot;
so , more than that , and with this sentence , i &apos;d like to close to close to one again , and again , designers have to think differently to come to new solutions , and in this sense , thank you very much for your attention and please .
and i definitely know that it would be for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to catch this dark path in the way that i think -- especially in my career , i just find myself in my career .
the older black man stood up . he looked at the deputy , and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come in and i &apos;ve come to say this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal . they don &apos;t give the eyes . &quot;
so , the problem of cooperative online worlds like the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so peaceful to stand at the beginning of an episode of an episode that we rather spend our entire time in these worlds .
later on day i went around on this site with miguel and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems to be so natural , &quot; when every farm i &apos;ve ever been on , &quot; how do you succeed ? &quot;
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic eggs that the arctic eggs , for nearly three million years , had the size of the bottom 48 states , about 40 percent .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles across philadelphia , baltimore baltiway to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all the young black men are either in jail , in jail , in jail , or with discrimination .
unmediated by this election between the 21st and the 24th and february , a rice of about 30 famine allowed to the two places that were interested in most of the world , most of the business of the building .
the last example i &apos;ve spent time showing it is a musician sequencing for live , which we &apos;ve developed recently , and in the lethal , as leaders , like leadership and shredding .
and we started to create pieces , starting with the fifth of the five to seventh letters , and they put them together to put them in 24,000 letters together to add these 50,000 letters to add up to 7,000 .
they gave us the story of the neuromarketing , as we tell the story in this movie today , that you use mris to make the fun of the brain , both advertising and movies as well .
so i started thinking , and so i think , with security in the past few months , while i was working on the book that &apos;s going to be soon -- as the dangerous , dangerous , unexpected , very expectations of my success .
both in my profession , robin and also in my way as a volunteer , as a fireman , i &apos;m witnessed by generosity and friendship in large scale , but i also see the role of love and the mutual love of poverty .
suppose you &apos;re living in a certain remote area , and you have a loved ones with oblivious heart disease , and your house physician transmitted to this doctor , which is the average performance of the average performance in 200 .
but when i came up with him , and i asked him why he made this intervention -- it was risky surgery -- his answer was that in his country , these kids would be treated very bad , and so he had to do it .
and when and then , of course , there &apos;s something intuitively intuitively and how i can take an impact on it and make things so that they make a friendly friendly friendly , so they &apos;re intuitive because they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re just fun to use it .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- the ones that make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do it , those who do the battle , the lack of sleep , and the limitations without failures , with bad results and the good results .
it &apos;s also got three big problems . the cost , especially in high-cost countries , the question is high . the question of security is that you can really feel that nothing can be wrong , despite the human work , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid to be afraid of a real gas , and it keeps millions of people off the earth .
now , to decide that there &apos;s no glass melate to buy is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our silence -- but it turns out that decision-making problems also affect us in very much more conventional decisions .
i don &apos;t have to do these things , because in the same way , it &apos;s always going to be a different kind of crazy , colorful , colorful of the outcome , which is just waiting for me when i love a little bit of love and search .
so this is one effect . the other effect is that even when we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end up with less peace than the election of choice , as if we had the opportunity to choose less possibilities .
here &apos;s a photograph that i took on the northern baffin islands when i went out with inurustians on the whale guns . and this man , ava olya told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the memorial itself , and you can think of the memory itself as a kind of living itself , which gives you a living life itself through experience that doesn &apos;t need alive .
i mean , if i &apos;m in the face alone , i do all kinds of weird things , but then i go up to other people , and i listen to all these things , because i don &apos;t want to do it with it , or frankly , you know .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to use less and less , but in average , the number is going to go up , and so every year , more than doubled , the number of the services per person .
i met these people of grass , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows you to promote a light on any arbitrary surface , and then draw with a laser punch on it , which is just registering the negative surface .
so what that means when we look at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and particularly as we look at predictions in the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
so there &apos;s great challenges here . there are challenges in transmission . if we say that the energy source is outside of the country , they don &apos;t just need the technology to deal with the risk that the energy comes from anywhere else .
but , as we think , the only way we think about biology has a big impact without even further on food costs or resources of food , is that if we look at co2 as an outcome , and so we &apos;re going to work on these cells .
i started working with scientific literature to work on how these centrifuries are built in natance and found that they &apos;re structured in so-called kakies , and every castor contain of 164 .
now the fascinating is that the betakar , who are contains in liane , mainhihihibitors of exactly the kind of thing that &apos;s necessary to ask the tamins of tamins . so they ask themselves .
this is a problem because the global warming is looking for the arctic ocean ocean , where there &apos;s huge amounts of hydrogen carbon , which is a huge amount of carbon , which if it &apos;s deployed by microbes of microbes .
and what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack was actually to let it slowly happen slowly and unfortunate -- obviously in the attempt to desperate engineers , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get behind the dawn .
so maybe this technological change of this technological change , because there &apos;s always a different truth , which is that every human society can give something special and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt our scale .
my good friend ray short because we &apos;ve shown us that every tool that will become the information technology technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , it &apos;s large , and the prices of price equals , and the price of the equality is doubling by about 24 months .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as a international group , when we &apos;ve become aware of ourselves , o.k , there &apos;s now as real scenes , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re all talking about the people that are there and so on .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk away , and never be as moving as much as other kids , or that you could never lead a independent life , and since then they just punched me . &quot;
what if we could rotate this situation and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going from one to another , we &apos;re starting to go from many things to many things to many things to many things to many things , and by seeing patterns that would be located ?
this is what we &apos;re feeling so innocent on earth , that we say , there &apos;s no biodiversity , there &apos;s no biodiversity , no bioland , no other progression of progression , and as they all say , that our own creature allow us to go back .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i found something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in individual organisms , each cell , each cell , and all the genetic information cell is being led to death in both dead cells .
this was worth taking me for all of this year in clean space , because , you check the massword between a single atom and this piece of metal is just like the difference between the metal and all of the difference between the metal and all of you .
and i then got it up until six-year-olds , and then we &apos;ve become collaborated with friends , i &apos;ve become a founder of the solo company , which then came together with the donor of a spider &apos;s largest cell manufacturer .
at the time , it was just a monkey , where astrus and others said , &quot; you &apos;re actually crazy to read the people when people start reading the people , then they want to talk about it , and of course , it &apos;s totally fine . &quot;
if a maker in spain , something unlikely , something magical has done : allah , lake , olar , allah , allah , lalah , lalah , lawn , great bravo , there &apos;s a freak : it &apos;s a review of god .
so what &apos;s going on in &quot; the mosquito , &quot; is that everything from the bottom up to the end , from the beginning to the end , to the end , is completely devastating with marks -- from the sponsor that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the marx .
and the message is now , we need to decrease these animals , in fact , if we multiply our targets , 20 percent , 20 percent , 20 percent , trigger , trigger , three percent , three percent and so on , if we want to reach the ones at all .

now , as a consequence of this , it &apos;s especially anxious for these schizophrenic stages , and sometimes it &apos;s so bad , and he &apos;s disappeared , and he &apos;s disappeared in the streets of skull around the street , and this horror and the horror of his own mind .

every time we think of congestion and landscape , we either described rousy and the old rubber of the wild wilderness , which is in his simplistic idea , or more , and say , these people are connected to nature than we are .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the quest of life &apos;s life , a grandmother -- a grandmother , a grandmother and two daughters , and two daughters of their days that have been abandoned since years by telling them the stories of their stories every day , and we still meet three bed in the same bed .
but we don &apos;t even know if we listen to somebody like this , because we know this kind of kind of time for a long time . in a way , we have the internal internal internal and collective , that creativity and somehow , creativity , and of course , and that art -- is always the end of the quelseal .
and what we did was we actually used a new kind of network to use a new kind of network that was used in the world -- this is a mobile phone web -- and anonymbling and anonymity and aggregated information from this network to get the nearest to understand how the city works .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual in the center of the universe -- about gods and mysteries and mysteries , and there &apos;s no more for mystic , the felity of golity .
in our wish , to protect people who are in hearts , and to tell them the calendar truth about their medical votes , or even a prostitution to the quality of life that they have to expect , that we don &apos;t adapt to the stone for that somebody is actually disabled .
i told you about four techniques , which is the problem of decision-making millennium millennia -- you &apos;re going to get the overseas alternatives ; you &apos;re going to be able to do it -- you can do real category -- we can deal with more categories , less possibilities .
because we have this self-deception , this feeling , to be great , triggered from the highest creatures , not from such a true reconciliation of something so unpredictable as an organism that exists on a rock , and otherwise the other thing that is unsustainable for us .
and that &apos;s when you &apos;re all about your emotions and the long as you &apos;re working on work and all the other things that we &apos;re really exciting about , government , in the core of tim , in the words of tim lrily , which we &apos;re doing , &quot; which we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
this may seem to be a little bit abundant , so i repeat it , so i can make it happen : if we can solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity and obesity and obesity , i think we have to try to play games at least 21 billion hours a week for the next week .
and our goal was , in fact , we wanted to come to seventh up to nine-percent renewable renewable and then the rest of this rest , the rest of the rest of the last 10 , the last 10 percent renewable , which is going to be very expensive , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work out that batteries are made out of batteries .
but it &apos;s going to find 17 masters that were willing to be involved in these control that wanted to do with somebody who wanted to do this as eighty and how i play , and finally , to tell us the stories that we usually couldn &apos;t tell stories that we might not have been able to tell stories -- the stories that would never support .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never simulate any reasonable , whether it worked , but since then modern computers , there &apos;s modern computers , you can simulate it , you can simulate it , and you can see that , yes , with the right materialistic approach , it looks like it &apos;s functional .
but the process and the heavy climbing that he had been surrounded when he took it out of the genius out of where he didn &apos;t take anything from , and then where he came back to where he came back . he realized that it was not going to be an internal thing .
so this strange event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called drug , pray , pray , something that decided to be different from all my previous books in the world , and a big mega-scale event , international thing became an international thing .
a continent is always left , because the assumption was that there was no religious faith in africa , of course , there was a voodoo and odoo &apos;s just the overwhelming of these very deep religious religious religious thoughts that would come during the tragedies of slavery .
but in truth , we &apos;re always seeing more and more and more that if you &apos;re willing to be limited , and the unimportant opportunities are going to be going on , well , there &apos;s a increase in numbers of numbers , there &apos;s a cost of selling numbers , there &apos;s the cost of numbers , and there &apos;s a improvement of enlightenment .
and one day he looked at me at one of my practices -- these practices were just tired and gnasty -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re an army , you &apos;re so staring , and it &apos;s a young girl , and you &apos;re a young girl , one day one of those dancer .
and the wind and the sun and the sun and the burden came in and came to the outcome , a very exciting result of the result , that you can go to the conventional system for the conventional system , which after 20 years , you need a mining of about five cents a gallon , about four cents an hour , and about four cents an hour .
and the problem that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can just be an access to what things like simple things , so that a simple problem is to throw a problem , a question , and how to do it , or how to do it , or how to do it better .
add crops of plant food , scores , low-cost means of monocultures , chemicals on the earth , the hills , fish , fish , fish , and all the time it asked the agrass industry : &quot; if we can feed people more cheap , how bad can it be ? &quot;
not through the latest madspeakers and tractorial inventions , but through fertility , not through pump , not through pump , but through fresh water , not through fresh water , but through forests , but through forests , through the forests , and not through fishing and fishing , but through the ocean .
these are the ones that have a more artistic direction , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and collaboration with scientists , working with scientists , trying to ask themselves to deal with these technologies and ask questions and ask them to be creative and creative , because there &apos;s a museum , and there &apos;s all kinds of things .
so , you add up the summerized carbon , which has increased the temperature , and this temperature has increased a few negative consequences , and effects on the sky , and perhaps worse , the evidence that the natural sequence of natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to the natural systems , and so that all the systems can fall together .
updates are frogs , things that play are frozen , like the prince of prince , mice , abandoned , devastating , devastating , and lovely like un-flynn , and agonil , aggressive , aggressive , magic and mycelian .
in other parts , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran up and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house and the poem and the poem through them through them , and she passes them through them , and she said it would go on to land -- and as she said -- she said , after a few other people .
maybe this is a modern-day contribution , and if you care better than me , that would be great , but my core statement here is that we have to work on all five of them , and we can &apos;t give them an excessive , because they all have significant problems .
and where you can see how far we &apos;re going to get away from what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , that we are at all on earth , you can see that there &apos;s an openly program that has a program , until you want to be 20 , you want to be here , yes , right ?
in my 2020 years of medical consciousness and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal study about medical mistakes and wrong treatments so that i &apos;ve made all kinds of things for my first article for the first article i &apos;ve been writing for the toronto my &quot; white show , &quot; kind of cotton , &quot; to learn .
with the total transparency of total transparency , what the new thinking is , what &apos;s on the old button , yes , doesn &apos;t tell you that in the laser horn horse and meat is no longer a meat of meat or other phenomena , which i want to do , and i want to do it in a minute .
now , not exactly what i was hoping , but i went to go to this -- the stairs , the flur , along the way , along the real firemen , the real firemen , who had been finished at that point at this point where the time were pretty well done in the room to get some sleep .
i had to get a lot of staggering , often repeat these thick , elastic levels -- in different colors -- that you know , to build my leg muscles , and i hated this bloody of the beds . i hate them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole bacterial chromosome . it has more than 80,000 letters of genetic code . so we thought we were building it in the size of the virus , we could understand the size of the virus , we could understand the size of what the individual cell is .
and from a conversation with dean artist today , one of the innovators of the innovators , i want to share something with you -- he gave me the permission -- his technique , &quot; the slingling , &quot; and it &apos;s heard from many of you may have heard . it &apos;s the size of a refrigerator in college .
&quot; cloud-fashioned &quot; -- something that my friends call &quot; autodesk &quot; -- sensory sensors , sensors and networks , robots , 3d printing , 3d printing that allow us to provide personal production on our planet , synthetic , synthetic biology , biology , vaccines and vaccines , digital materials and digital materials .
you can see this amazing demonstrations : voodoo actress in a state of light , the light bulbs without burning coal , an amazing enveloping of the spirit of the mind so that it affects that when it comes to an extreme state in the extreme condition .
this was the most surgerman form of a d√©jelu , who i &apos;ve ever experienced . because before i knew about a corner of a bow , i always knew what was going on in the light cycle of the vehicle , because i was going to go over monthly shot , and i was going to go to film the movie .
in this picture , i have a bush sketch as a center of despair in all directions , because if you look at the rings of the tree of life , everybody looks at the existing specialists in this two-dimensional terms of evolutionary success , they &apos;ve survived it ; they &apos;ve got it over its environment , and they &apos;re demonstrated .
and with this premise with this premise with this premise , for example , brian degger in england , has tried a minimum disabled together , then it took a printing pressure coopera coopera , a hot cop , and it &apos;s like this , and it &apos;s done with bacteria .
and then finally , from the do-it-it-or-org &apos;s website , the founder of the founder , and said o.k , we have to meet now , we &apos;ve got to meet ourselves , real , real , real , and then has two organized events , a thousand , a thousand , and short , and short , in the u.s. , in san francisco , in san francisco .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- that you want to get zero , and that &apos;s going to be dependent on the number of people &apos;s number of people who use the services that each person in the average person using average energy , the average energy for every unit and the unit of carbon , the energy that will emphasize the energy per .
and the realization of president lobo was that , in a sense , the wisdom of wisdom , i was thinking about as a way to bring out the foreign investors to get to this city and build this city as a city , could be meaningful to all partisas for all partisas , for many years , have been scared for many years .
i read this list of a friend , and i had to read loud , and i had to laugh the first time , it was so ridiculous , but i was just smiling until only until i could say , &quot; and couldn &apos;t stop talking more , and i had to stop reading , and to collect me for that extent , and to get rid of the emotional fluctuation and to the emotional truck .
a group from araa , which i learned a while ago , a while ago , which is a student that wants to convey a student group who wanted to convey more of the public , what they learned in the unlearned , and they &apos;ve been doing so on the street , and they &apos;re trying to explain so on small actors and try and explain to people what na n.a is .
there are 175 rescues in my supermarket when they don &apos;t count the 10 extra olive olive oil and 12 balances that you could buy a big number of sales in your own sales , in which there &apos;s no chance that the 175 store is right for you .
and this was really , really , very , very bitter , and then you go into this kind of phase , you know , it &apos;s going to be a picture where i &apos;ve asked a picture where i &apos;ve asked me 10 years after 10 years , a thousand years ago , which was still the basic lowest , of course , that &apos;s really great whether that &apos;s supposed to be really great .
first of all , what i &apos;m going to show you , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , is a new technology that we have a new technology that we &apos;re going to be translated as part of a year ago , a year ago , which is seal ragon . and it &apos;s an environment that &apos;s either in which you can either be able to deal with the same amount of visual data or visual data .
the first thing you &apos;re going to do when you &apos;re going to be big as a child , as a baby , is that you care about what shells you have like , yes ? and depending on whether your parents allow them to play more or more or less at the end of the box , more their curiosity , of course , their curiosity , of course .
i mean , most of the moments of our lives -- and i &apos;ve done this -- you know , psychological presentation for about three seconds , which means that you know , for about three seconds , which means , you know , there are about 600 million lives in a month . there are about 60,000 million of them , and most of you don &apos;t leave them .
bill gates : to get the simulation of the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we need just a few million . and even if we have our materials in a russia , we &apos;ve got our russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s better , it &apos;s just in the 1000-million .
it really works , that &apos;s going to be done in the academic , and then we thought , o.o.k , that we may have been able to get a webcam , then we &apos;ve taken a webcam , and then you &apos;ve done the lens that you &apos;ve done , then you &apos;ve got a microscope , it &apos;s about a hundred thousand times .
if i show you 600 newspapers , and you put them in 10 categories , or i &apos;ll show you 400 newspapers , and these in 20 categories of categories , then you believe that i have given them more choice and a better choice than i would have given them 400 to you when i would have given them 600 .
it &apos;s friday friday friday , friday friday friday friday friday friday friday . bon friday friday friday friday , friday friday friday friday . tfriday friday friday friday friday . you don &apos;t think that we would do this conversation without talking about this video without talking about this video .
i think i believe a significant channel -- not the only thing , but a significant changer to this explosion of depression , and also suicide is that people have experienced disappointment because their standards are so high . and then , if you have to explain these experiences , they have to be aware of themselves .
the neolithic revolution that brought us to agriculture , and in this moment , the cult of safatal corresponds , the poetry of the poetry of the smellie &apos;s proposes through the prosthetic and the hierarchy , and hierarchy , specialization and only 10,000 years ago , we found 10,000 years ago .
so this is , if you focus a laser , on a room , you can catch little particles in the room , and you can catch little particles in the air or in the air , and then move into this liquid , and then you move into this focus , so that &apos;s where it &apos;s like a traction of a torture principle .
it would be great if we could bring this paradigm to the normal paradigm against a different kind of strength , or the strength of strength to reform it even a little bit more dangerous , muddling , so we can put the forces from very many children , and invite them to bring their special skills to the full skills in society .
you know , you know , when michelo moo shaped the mosquito , it means he took the end of the hammer and took him down to mosquito -- you can actually see a little bit of untested -- and she said , &quot; well , what would you say ? &quot; why don &apos;t you ? &quot;
but if you buy a new color printer in 2011 today , you can buy a new colorful printer from the leading printing output , and you can print a page , and then you printed this helpful site on every side of each side , in one pattern , in one pattern , the clear side you can pursue it on your backpack .
my colleague in the process with asks , assae bee , could tell you much more about the true and the many other wonderful things you can do with real things , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part of the second part that we &apos;re talking about , and that &apos;s the environment that we &apos;re talking about .
now , the problem , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have sympathy , the sympathy for the harm of the difficult ones , they look like orgell and frog frog , but they &apos;re sort of looking at the past , in the past , as the past , as the world , our world is continued .
and then i tried to do this in my lab , in my lab , i was trying to extend a little bit , and then i could buy it in the cell phone trade on ebay and buy a little bit of n.a analysis , which is trying to do an avatar , so this is so ennicup to do this , and i &apos;ll do this next time .
and if you &apos;re going to choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two ways of self and you have to think about how you decide this conflict , and that &apos;s not really obvious , because if you think of time , you &apos;re going to have an answer . and if you think of the answer , you might get another answer .
in the early 800s , i got a really amazing task when my professor at harvard asked me if i was interested in going to haiti , to go to haiti and film the secret societies , the foundation of the power of duvalidious and alice and mada , and the poison was used to make it safe .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me about how i &apos;m going to go with jokes , and i &apos;m going to tell you something about this sentence : this sentence has never been adapted for me , and i always felt very uncomfortable to answer people , and i think that &apos;s why i understand why .
and if i &apos;m talking about this now , for example , in the orientary of view , selected , selected as selected selection , where everyone comes from , it &apos;s too big to me , i can stop in the detail , and yes , yes , i &apos;m going to send it anywhere , or buy somebody else , and so on .
i recommend all of you to read steves or to see the film , so that you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful interconnectedness between these two men , but also how the music helped this connection and how it was helped to create this instrument , when this game is a game that &apos;s called nasty .
here in the bottom of the picture , you see the lab , in leadership , so there &apos;s a garage with all kinds of labeling labs , which has untrained , a group of mimimimimics that has a group that has evolved in paris , and that &apos;s pretty interesting and interesting , i &apos;m going to take a project for a moment .
not a biologist would say , for example , that 50 percent of all species are dying in front of the extinction , because it &apos;s not true . and yet , this apocalyptic scenarium on the field of biological diversity -- barely what &apos;s known as the most optimistic area of the cultural diversity of cultural diversity .
bg : well , we haven &apos;t given us to a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting rules for everything that &apos;s called the nuclear , and there &apos;s a big interest in the name , and there &apos;s the people of the entrepreneurs in russia , russia , china , i was here , and i met the power of energy , like this , like this .
the computer visions algorithms have given these pictures together so that they &apos;re given to the real space that all of these images that have been made near the grasslands in the canadian rock in the canadian rockies , and they &apos;re going to see elements of stallas , or dietas or diettes , and all these things have been involved in each other in each other .
and if you &apos;re part of the software that we &apos;ve seen , we &apos;re looking at it , you &apos;ll also understand why nevertheless , why we don &apos;t have any of our software today , or not intuitive on users , it &apos;s the ipad in many places , or in many ways , it &apos;s much more intuitive than classic .
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; this sounds like a good thing , but in reality , there &apos;s a shift in reality for the responsibility for somebody who knows something about the choices of someone who knows something about the namely -- the doctor -- the doctor knows nothing , and probably not the highest thing , and that &apos;s not the best choice of the constitution .
and this idea saved me as i was in the middle of a writing process , pray , and i fell into one of the slice of the two , and i fell in one of the two branches that we fall in , when we all work on something , and we don &apos;t work on it . you think it &apos;s going to think that it &apos;s the most astonishing book that &apos;s ever written .
we also have one of these same aggregators in the same size of the same size , which is where the hale is brought in , in fact , the complete dynamics of this web , so in half , it looks like that there &apos;s a half-out of the back there , which is the big batteries here , which we &apos;re going to simulate the net .
they thought that a kind of genius was this kind of magician &apos;s magic creature that was believed that it was literally living in the walls of an artist eliatom -- which is kind of like dobby cotton -- the house of the house -- and the artist &apos;s work in some kind of invisible work , and the work would make the result of work .
if i want to give you one of the things today is that the total data that we consume is larger than the sum of the parts of their parts and instead of thinking about information , i want to think about how we can use information , how we can use information , so we can see patterns , and we &apos;re not recognized .
so we &apos;ve done in a study that i &apos;ve done with swomo benni and alessandro , we &apos;ve done a study with people at the people -- that worked for all -- and these people have been working in a collection collection in which they &apos;ve collected their savings for their savings .
well , interesting historic footprint : when the mosquito spare , they brought this use of use , and the language changes over the centuries of centuries , allah allah , allah allah , alolar , moth , you &apos;re still fighting , you &apos;re still fighting to fight the penalty and dancer dancer .
now , now , today , you need , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this -- something like this -- which has the car in real time in real time , some thousand sensors of sensors that information from the car , give the information to the system to the system , and then you use these things to take back into this car and make things happen in real time .
i was afraid , not because i was afraid , but i was afraid that i could lose him that he could sink into his circumstances , and that i could destroy his relationship to the mind , if i started talking about sound and pearos , and other exciting forms of daylight daylight .
so , in fact , the fact that you remember the 20th century in 300 years , in 300 years , not for your wars or technological innovations , but more than a era of a era , where we were against the massive destruction and the massive cultural diversity and the cultural diversity of the earth are either active , or the problem is not the change .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which should be the measured of latte things in visual effects and computational effects in a whole new haven &apos;t been able to shoot with the human realistic characteristic characteristics that were made by the spectacular characteristics that were made . and the characters should be all the main , and the world should be cg .
i probably hear the two nests are still there , because i probably listen to the generation that has saved this bad image because i &apos;ve started to study hundreds of thousands of thousands of injuvenious machine in carrillas in carrice , which is called high-tech school , i think it &apos;s kit .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a fragile answer to my lecture , who was a story of my lectures , who said a story of history . &#91; unclear &#93; &#91; unclear &#93; -- he said he was a sintrony , and it was absolutely absolutely music , and at the end of the end , there was a complete sound of the sound of the sound .
do you know ? i think you know , i think you have to allow a person to think that he &apos;s thinking , or he &apos;s how it &apos;s like the vessels , like the essence and the source and the source of gods and the divorce , uncreative , unheard , unseen mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious , a little bit to make you think of a human mind , human mind .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and at the same time the same time the co2 , the skeptics say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in it , that it &apos;s not a co2 that i wish that it was almost impossible to accept it , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the method . &quot;
it &apos;s actually the kind of thing that &apos;s true , because if you have a patient who says , we have two reflections in two different surgeons , and he decides what he &apos;s going to decide , which is the one that &apos;s elected , the memory of the memory that is actually less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be selected .
you know , all of you know the healthy dogs , if you give a secret of the best impossible prize , even though this one is swallowed on weighing , and then you get caught up and you get a best friend , and the best friend confronts a discussion , but when you end up with a bad discussion , and you make a sense that you will never make a mistake again .
you know , one of the great reasoners in travel , and one of the enjoyment of the ethnography research is to live together with people who can still remember the old days , the old days . their past is still in the past , they feel like a rainfall , they &apos;re embedded in the mud of plants .
if you ever have the chance to have the opportunity to work in a urban call center center , like our scott silver sys , as a silver team of programming -- in fact , they do all the things -- you see that people who are going to call the government , because of different problems , including a couple of different problems in your house .
in fact , the nice thing is , if you do that , agriculture is doing agriculture , biogas , biogas , on a hectar country with five a.c. housing in favelas , so it can wait for about a thousand-thousands of thousands of dollars , and it &apos;s waiting for a chicken and a chicken and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables .
we &apos;re at the threshold of amazing threshold , amazing events on many areas , but i really think that we have to go back hundreds of years ago , 300 years ago , to find a time to find a progress in which we &apos;ve been fighting , in the process , in which we &apos;re talking about these things , we &apos;ve got more suspicious than now .
so by making color , by changing color , contress and helplessness to the rarity of the individual images , photographers , photographers of fish , like muddy , mudged color , distant color and disorders , we have the boundaries between different images , and how they look like a photograph , even though there &apos;s hundreds of old views of old levels .
if i were to ask in a room full of colleagues with colleagues and ask for their soviet support , and to tell them what i just told you , i probably didn &apos;t want to reach the end of the second story before they were really going to get uncomfortable , somebody would change a joke , they would change the rest and forget the rest of them .
now , if you &apos;re one of the ones that don &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good moment to turn your audiences , take your personal communications device -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can look at a school book , which is not going to be able to be able to do anything else in this talk .
a few years ago , the laser prize prize scientist shinya amyanaka for his research in his research , he took a sculpture , a fiber blade , and the manipulation of only four genes to lead them to an induced cell -- a cell -- is able to be able to be able to get a potential cell in a body .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve made all kinds of batteries that are being made , looking for cars , computers , mobile phones , lamps , lamps , for everything . and that &apos;s what i used with the amount of electronic power that uses the world . i found that all the batteries that we &apos;ve been able to produce is less than 10 minutes of value .
now , let &apos;s go back to the time of the big bang , 14 years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four billion years ago -- the first sign of animals , maybe three or four billion years ago , until four billion years ago , on earth &apos;s earth -- perhaps the first multi-organisms , perhaps as much as a hundred or 800 years ago -- and then the species of the 130,000 years ago .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral emergency emergence , which was finally found in the computer with pictures of flickr successes . they just give notre emergency dwardfolds into a hackr and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts in shirts and at the university of the university , and so on , each of these colored a model that was discovered as a model as a model .
and yet , in this country , here in this country , in the united states , we &apos;re going to make people -- here &apos;s the risk to be convicted to death , higher , higher than the victims , when the victims are black . when it &apos;s 22 times higher , when the victims are black and white in the same states -- in the same states , the body of the people who live in their bodies .
i once traveled with a young colleagues 6,000 miles of chief in west china , through southern dose tibet , and only when i went to lla , i saw the face behind the statistics of the statistics . 6,000 monuments were turned into the sailing and turned into 1.2 million people who were transformed during the cultural revolution .
and so , the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of problems , in something that you &apos;ve only invested later -- and that &apos;s because the investment isn &apos;t so clear . in fact , ipc is not necessarily the worst of i.q. and there are people in the rich world , and there are people in the rich world , and you can see drapc , okay , that &apos;s not big .
we cleaned the chromosome of a microbes of a species . grove , these two are far away from each other , like humans and mice . we gave them some extra chromosome to choose this chromosome chromosome . we were able to destroy it with all the enzymes , and it was a very amazing thing that we &apos;re going to do in a cell -- and it &apos;s very appreciated here .
margaret garet mead , the great anthropologist in before she died that her biggest fear is that while we &apos;re moving towards the direction of the fact that we &apos;re moving forward to the fast-forward world view , we &apos;re not just moving the whole range of human imagination in a wide variety of human imagination , but we would see that one day , we &apos;ve forgotten out of a dream , and that there have ever been other opportunities .
i &apos;d like to show you the original data set of noah , and this is from a early prototype of photosynth synth sync in the summer to show you what i think it really is that the real technology is behind this photosynthesizing technology . and this is not so obvious if you look at the website that we have on the website .
in some ways , with other words , sugar pillars have shown a measurable effect , placebo effect , and it &apos;s just because the person thinks about what happens to you , is that you &apos;re going to be a pharmaceutical or a kind of pharmaceuticals -- like , there &apos;s only enough patient , if you believe in the body that you call the placebo effect .
if one was saying no , it was the voper cart that &apos;s got a completely crumbling . i &apos;ve spent 10 years , i &apos;ve been very difficult for the age of my age , whether i &apos;m going to get my great engineering to really , really , really , really , to get a wax point of my colleagues , because all my colleagues are always talking about my father &apos;s money , you &apos;ve got money to the window in your child .
i recently had a meeting like this when i met the extraordinary american editor in ruth stone , which is now 90 , but the whole life of their lives , and she told me that when she grew up in the villages of villages in the villages of virginia , and she said , &quot; she would feel like a poem on the landscape that she could listen about . &quot;
it means that a small child is growing up in the belief that the mountain is a puppet , or your destiny , who will be your destiny or your destiny , will determine another person , and have another relationship to this place , or this place , as a little child growing up in montana , is that a pile is a pile that a pile can be burned .
my role usually is my role in telling people how wonderful technology are going to be the new technologies that are going to be on , and i thought i was here , here i am under friends , i would tell you what i &apos;m really thinking . and i think i &apos;m going to try and try to understand what &apos;s going on , and what &apos;s going on here , and what &apos;s going on in front of these incredible insights that we can &apos;t be able to be able to get away from the front of .
and that would be your answer to the bjn borg &apos;s argument that if you &apos;re using all these time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other targets , the causes of poverty , the causes of poverty , the poverty , the poverty of malaria , and so on , that it &apos;s a duration of money to invest in money while there &apos;s better things that we can do .
these people have come online to go online to go online , but they &apos;ve used it illegal by using trojans to make money out of our bank accounts , while we &apos;re doing our online banking , or also the keyboard , the keyboard of our credit card information on the keyboard , while we &apos;re buying a computer online .
woman parks always came back to montgomomomomomomics , where she did two of her oldest friends . this elderly women , johnny johnson , the montus , who organized the monomy bush nowagunk -- an amazing virginia -- and virginia , virginia , a white man , whose husband , his wish , dr. durhry , dr. king .
and the one , and the ones that have been put together in two barrels and said , o.k , we make it easier and cheap , and then we &apos;ve got open source resources out of open source , so electronics , electronics , these things , and these things are now made together , and that are actually the market , and now the checks are the checkers of these around the world .
and that made me go to another person than my friends under the kwat , who believe that these forests contain the rise of humility and the hippie and the hipple and the hippies and the snaustril and the predators are the norway to the northeast of the world , which they would participate to their hairs .
a week ago , a week ago , the national academy academy of the media engineering in francis for francis and wilderness and wilderness , two scientists , the independently of other techniques , developed the natural techniques that encouraged the natural process of encouraging the evolution faster and wishes to make a more efficient sense of proteins -- which is called &quot; direct evolution . &quot;
and now in biology , and right now in biology , and since i want to take this metaphor , i want to take this metaphor from synthetic biology , that biology is actually an information science of science , because the n.a code is a abstract code is a abstract code , it &apos;s not quite like computers , because it &apos;s game dynamics , so it &apos;s not just matter , and it &apos;s not just cyber .
bruce bruce brown brown , a famous design researcher at british university is so far as far as to say that this mass media , he meant the book and the book , so the internet is not television and so on , etc . and so on , what we call &quot; mass media , &quot; and what we call the media &quot; mass media &quot; mass media &quot; and our ability to have collected our ability .
i &apos;m sure that chris has really , really , really , some happy people and corporations and profits , profit and profits , because i &apos;m sure that chris will never leave me back to the act -- the right thing to buy the right to the right talk , you just see the title of not a lot of content , and there would be a lot of content in the way that would actually be .
now , the phrase of this phrase lives with perpetrating idea of the idea of success , that success or happiness depends on how to create a challenge , without being impacted by the unlimited experience , and as if my life was so successful as my life is so successful , because i could lift the possible prosthetic life with a prosthetic life of a prosthetic life , or how to perceive people with me .
and when these people came and looked at these people and looked at who was the best proteins in the world , this was not a professor , also not a caltech student student , somebody from england , a woman , a woman who was a woman who was a woman who was working on a tape castle of the ceo at night , and worked the best proteins of protein in the world .
now , of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. pie . so i did the practices that i didn &apos;t want to do with the point of view that i wanted to do with the point that the fact that five year-old girls are going to be in the second hospital , but he actually taught me to see my practice with a new kind of eyes . this was so a new experience of experience .
during the past year i &apos;ve been looking for models for models for what i &apos;ve been doing , i &apos;ve also tried to do in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see whether they &apos;re better or better , or more reasonable ideas about how to help us deal with the creativity that are connected to creativity .
so we have a situation like this , so we have a situation where we continue to continue our science , we have to be so far more about this categories that these categories that we used to be stable for cotton categories that were very simple , very simple , very simple to identify inheritage identifications to create a lot of different theories , as we &apos;ve ever said .
so i went home and i went home and i went to my wife with my wife and told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use to use his eyes to control things , then we should find a way to make a tap that he could do , again , that he could do it again . &quot;
and so there are different things , and so there are different , but the beautiful thing about this is that a million molecule has a lot of energy as much energy as we say , a cohlehleh molecule , and so if you can deal with the problems and the problems of the footprint , the footprint , the cost of the footprint , and the potential , so the potential of the land and the other things that are almost one in its own .
from the medical point of view , you can tell that my legs , the laser surgeons for visually disabled , knees of titanium and artificial hike for aging bodies that allow people to really use all their possibilities , and the boundaries that have their natural destiny to speak , not to be able to be able to be able to be able to find yourself in a way of human and self-replicating groups in the world .
&quot; disabled , adjet : &quot; abundant , helpless , helpless , undestroyed , decreased , decreased , wounded , wounded , confined , confined , rejected , rejected , fugees , imitated , irritally , captured , captain , obesired , obesity , refused , weaked , weaked , weaked .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words to leave a english scientist . humphrey daisy , as i suspect , as he used the experiments of his experiments of his academic defense , his teacher was michael farake , &quot; this is not so dangerous for the human development of human mind , as a scientific idea that our appears are not mysterious , there &apos;s no mystery of nature , that our persistence are in the world &apos;s future , and that there &apos;s no new hope . &quot;
and we have a series of companies that are traveling in the ethnosphere where we can take our audience to places like this as a cultural winner , that they are confronted by the laws of harbor . and hopefully they &apos;re going to become one of the other centers of the central anthropology of anthropology : that this world has confronted to exist in different ways that we can actually find a global lifestyle in the world that we can contribute in all the world .
and one of them is , through the great choice of sales , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and which is salatridal ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a decision to make a different decision . and what &apos;s happening with this alternative decision that you &apos;ve made , that you &apos;ve made the decision , and that you &apos;ve made this decision to be able to get this kind of peace , and that if you have made it in your mind .
at the end of the end of this amazing , you &apos;re going to take a day outside , and for the first time in your life , in the age of 18 years , you see a sunrise . and in this critical moment of consciousness , one of the first of the sun , when the sun begins to start the beautiful landscape of the landscape , what &apos;s suddenly learned in the abstract of things that you &apos;ve learned in abstract in abstract , and you know , &quot; and you &apos;ve really seen it really told you . &quot; how did you really tell you ?
i really found that he had exposed to the entire time of my entire childhood , no matter whether i had a letter in the second grade , whether i had won in the second grade , whether i was running with the path of parenting in parenting , whether i was wrong with the parenting , whether i did a pencil , or a pencil , and i had a college , and he was using his students to teach these students to teach the medical school students from school students and school students .
and if you &apos;ve got people in front of you , people who are the most compelling that they have a soul , or you can also say that you believe that you &apos;ve been able to live from the soul of the soul , then the souls are so much more than the sought of matter , not just a matter of matter , you don &apos;t think of blood , or something like it , or even the earth , it &apos;s unbelievable , it &apos;s unimportant .
so as an information technology -- inspired by the way of our interaction with real objects -- with my professional patres and my colleague and my colleague and eve eyewitni , i started to wonder : what would we use when we use the computer , instead of a curriculum , like a bottle of a fingerprint -- what if we could do with these two things -- and how could we attack it ?
so , i &apos;d like to summarize my talk about my talk , and in the sense that the characteristics and the properties that we have made out of the vocabulary age , and the skills that we &apos;ve gone out of the bird age , and we &apos;ve gone through a little bit like this kind of machine age are in the age , which is called cyber , which is something called cyber activates , and that we can actually activate these kinds of complex , and that we can &apos;t come back into the new kind of technology , but we can actually come back into the future .
in the age of 18 years , the young actor will be separated in the age of three and four years from their families and four years from their families , and in a shadow world of startup , in the blue bones of the glaciers of 18 years of 18 years . two of the dreams of nine years of nine years of nine years of nine years old , the time , the paralysis of the pregnancy , they &apos;re now scored in their mother , and they &apos;re separated in the grave of their mother &apos;s grace .
now , what happens when we put an american message at this point in this place has four jazz to javitao , &quot; what happens when we have an undolphin of our land -- what if we just take a message -- one of the american message -- a part of the american canadian empire -- and if people want to work under the united states , or if they can work under the united states , or at the united states , you can go to the united states , and do everything on the united states of this land , or you might be able to go to america ? &quot;
i &apos;d like to leave you with a poem by a poem by a poet named pocket in 14th century , and i was told by my friend jacques , and the friend of jacques . and the poem said , &quot; the poem is just the four words . &quot; god , &quot; god don &apos;t know the god , god , god , the god , the god &apos;s name , but the god , the god , the god &apos;s god &apos;s name , and he always says , &quot; and he always tells me .
if someone &apos;s made up , and all these sacrifices have made , and all these sacred rifices , and who are all of them , then my photo of the emergency cathedral data suddenly transmitted with all this data , and i can use them as a glorious space to use in this room , to use these photos , in these different kinds of different kinds of people who are using a kind of social experience and different kind of model of model of models .
but of course , again , we have the problem of a huge following story , but of course , again , the problem of a entrepreneurship and then we have two thousand , a small group that we &apos;re going to go back , and we &apos;re going to go back to the next few , and we &apos;re going to go back to the future , and that &apos;s called the future of my crazy , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to say , again , again , people who &apos;s going to talk about what we &apos;re going to be talking about , we &apos;re not going to be talking about .
it remains a lot of place in the malaria , it doesn &apos;t exist a lot of place in malaria , in the harbor south south , or the cold of cold tibet , but still through a mysterious form of earth , and a mystery of the planet that doesn &apos;t form on the idea that you can be aware of the idea , but one of the idea that the idea of the idea that you can exist in the idea of the human consciousness , because you can only exist in consciousness .
to make sure that the system is evolving to create bathwork , to make it easier for people to make mistakes , to make it easier to eradicate people , and also enable them to create inherent spaces where everybody can actually make health care , who can actually be observed in public health care , reviews , and actually rewarded for the errors , and even for people who will be rewarded to make the errors of this errors .
i even had with my professor with my professor , richard evan man , who &apos;s morultrous , who &apos;s the decepa vian discovery with the magical discovery of mexico in mexico , discussed over the 300s . i argue that you couldn &apos;t see that this is a hallucinated moment when you couldn &apos;t experience the hallucinema , where you can &apos;t experience a hallucinate imum that you can &apos;t experience more hallucinate .
and again , the story of many of you will know the story about it , because steves a book that was later , again , a book that was filmed with junior as steve nyz and pex and peacex , as a peer-anthropy , as a writer , conjuraisonia , who was finally acted at the july of july conservation , the july of juvenuelessness of july , and his career in parallel &apos;s early days .
for example , women used the concept , for example , used women , the right thing that the elected concept , the concept of the folikeholders , says that atoms are more important than the atomic atoms and said , &quot; we said that we have a mother , and that we don &apos;t have a difference as a significant difference , that we don &apos;t have enough to have the governmentation for the state of citizenship , and the law that we should have the law , etc .
now we all use , or many of us , or many of us , or a competing . but these services are particularly distributed in the state of iran , like iran , where they use longevic hives , as they know that they can use local confidence and more than they can be , that they can &apos;t be located in the local government , so much more than they can &apos;t compete that they can &apos;t compete in their government .
and so i ended up looking at people who are interested in the worlds , and i ended up looking at people who are interested in the worlds and interested in the worlds that have to do with nasa and to do with nasa diarrhea , and the right space and the right dream of space , and they &apos;re going to go to russia , and they &apos;re walking around the country , and then we &apos;re going to go through the social protocod , and then we &apos;re going to take our dream of international , and then we &apos;re going to take our dream with the mum with the m.
now , i have my worst errors to say , &quot; my show in my white show , &quot; in my white code , black , black , black , black , &quot; i have the aquake to say this is my worst mistake to every rescue of saving from the checkers to the cheologist , &quot; i say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; my name , &quot; blah , your blah , i &apos;m showing him what to it with him .
and we had to go back to the country and say , &quot; if you go back to land and go back and say , &quot; we had to do the glass , the glass and the scores and the whole , the whole technology , the whole , the whole difficulty , the human empire , &quot; if you can just explain the human experience , &quot; if you can &apos;t explain it , you can &apos;t explain it , or you can &apos;t tell someone like that , and you can never know that , and you &apos;ve never know that , you can never know , and you can never know anything else .
and wherever you see in the world , you will discover that these cultures are not underground . these are dynamic peoples , whose existence is degraded by existence by the forces that are willing to go through the capacity of the south africa . whether it &apos;s the unbelievable in the country in the country of the whales , in the south asia , in the south asia , where there &apos;s a host of candy , where the people who are now living in the forests , and they &apos;re going to look at the forestry of themselves , where they &apos;re going to go from the outside of the forest , where they are , and they &apos;re going to look at the south .
if you have a lot of real food , you have to live in real time , if you have a lot of real life , you have to find out what it is , if you have food , you have to find out what it is , you have to live in your real life , and you have to find out what it is that you have to find out of food , if you have a lot of time , and you don &apos;t have to live in your life , and you have to find yourself in your life , and you have to find yourself , and you have to find out what it &apos;s going to be real life , and then you have to find out if you have to find yourself , and then you &apos;re going to find yourself in your life , and then you have to find yourself , you have to find yourself in your life .
if you look at color , there &apos;s only one soundscapes of color , but it &apos;s just a little bit of color of color , but there &apos;s only two different parts of the carcinema that &apos;s produced , but there &apos;s no way of cleaning them , but it &apos;s just a bloody heart of the neutrine , but it &apos;s not just like a neutrash of the neutress of the neural system , but it &apos;s just like a neutranocastle of the neural system , it &apos;s just a neural system , but it &apos;s just a neural system , but it &apos;s just a little bit of a little bit of the harsh moore . it &apos;s not just as if there &apos;s a bars , it &apos;s a neubars in the harsh , but it &apos;s a neural carrippy of the harorn .
now , if you look at the stake of the human stakeholders , the most of the time , the most common sense of hearts , are still in the case of the harm of the harm of the world , that the harm of the harm of the harmful space is still in which we know that the harm of the harm of the harm of the harm of the harm of the harm , is still beyond the harm of the harm of the harm of the harm of the harm of the harm , that the harry , the harm of the harm of the harm of the harm of the birds are still in the world , the harm of the harst-born , the harst-born , the harst-born , that are still in which are still in the most likely to be a sense of the harm of the harm of the harm of the harm ,
for three years , why does girls live in a little girl , live in a little girl , live in a little girl , and a girl who can never talk to you about three years of life , and as a little girl &apos;s living in the bottom of this little girl , live in a little girl &apos;s life , and she can never talk about three years ago , and no longer live in her own life , and live in a little girl &apos;s life as a little girl &apos;s life , and as a little girl is going to live in the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of this little girl , so many years ago , and he &apos;s living navy , and how live in a little girl &apos;s life is going to talk about three years ago , and live in the age of the size of the size of a little girls live in the size of what they live in the water over the water over three years ago , and no longer than one years ago .
