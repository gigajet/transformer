from seattle ...
i don &apos;t know .
that is what sing it .
but it is .
don &apos;t find it .
yeah , hello .
we love innovation .
solar is ...
that &apos;s not ...
we were poor .
are they all ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
after a week .
great trick ?
that &apos;s what we were .
a few .
and he says ...
we know that .
ta-me !
wait twice .
here it is .
that &apos;s fast .
they need time .
music as a language .
that &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... not yet .
thank you .
what a fish .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
that &apos;s efficient .
wonderful , right ?
completely inefficient .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much .
come on .
the only chance .
there &apos;s no hospital .
thank you .
stephen watts .
three out of 10 .
that was incredible .
thank you . thank you .
yeah , it &apos;s kind of .
it &apos;s terrible .
long , yes .
fantastic , right ?
the sun is going on .
oh my god .
we love entertainment .
we pick it up .
where do you go ?
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we &apos;re losing them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
a lot of them .
does that sound good ?
the whole environmental debate .
sounds familiar , what ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
that &apos;s great .
that was fascinating .
can i be honest ?
the farm is incredible .
what did they do ?
robert gupta .
that &apos;s the system .
that &apos;s all right .
yeah , good day .
lensing , slowly .
that &apos;s all i &apos;m interested in .
we can do that .
what do you say ?
not very sustainable .
yes , milliseconds .
this is our present .
they have similar principles .
yeah , good day .
good job ! yes !
just do your job .
this was the result .
thank you very much .
and she did .
so they meet .
it &apos;s essential .
they &apos;re all important .
very different term .
so he &apos;s exciting .
that &apos;s me .
public is kavik .
yeah , that &apos;s .
flying cat .
this is the last one .
can we change it ?
these days are over .
these people make money .
what happened here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
restore it again .
and that &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know .
centers were built .
what happened here ?
but you know what ?
what was the result ?
i was amazed .
it &apos;s generic .
so they knew everything .
you could see manhattan .
here &apos;s the video .
it has sensors .
why no longer live ?
he opens the door .
already a few more .
that &apos;s very good .
oh , so the one .
there &apos;s no normal .
yes , i know .
pretty good , right ?
but you know what ?
i have a question .
okay . thank you .
i stood up with him .
don &apos;t sit around .
so you can do that .
they shrink . &quot;
so let &apos;s see .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
what do these people need ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i was thinking about it .
i find that interesting .
they use their hands .
so how does that work ?
what they &apos;re interested in is .
that would have been okay .
what are media today ?
you can go .
so where do we go ?
so it &apos;s true .
how do we know ?
because you know what ?
it &apos;s not a country .
why do we do that ?
not very often .
bg : thank you .
this is a wish .
and i was an artist .
let &apos;s call it don &apos;t .
not school management .
and the need to go back .
we can do it differently .
they even do hurts .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
a tremendous challenge .
there &apos;s no food .
it &apos;s against justice .
but the wrong things .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
i &apos;m a writer .
here &apos;s another example .
i forgot children .
it feels great .
i swear it .
i wonder .
that &apos;s not going to do it .
thank you for listening .
why should we do that ?
thank you .
here &apos;s an example .
you see it immediately .
not toxic poisons .
but i continued to work .
or bombs .
i &apos;m going to go in here .
there are two choices .
we need energy miracle .
why does this happen at all ?
oh . a moment .
let me tell you .
what do you want to do ?
that &apos;s what happens today .
and i continued to work .
so she was back .
and so it was .
yes , there it is .
i &apos;ll totally agree with you .
and why is that ?
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what would everything have to be done ?
i mean the soul .
you compare the same thing .
in china , it was different .
luckily , right ?
that &apos;s not a protection .
you know , pee .
does anybody see something particular ?
and i had always .
very expensive real estate .
people were playing crazy .
what does the illusion ?
my gut feeling again .
after just a journey .
first of all , limits .
i created one .
yeah . all right . all right .
imagine the camera .
jk : both .
but it gets worse .
so here you see it .
thank you very much .
be a mentor .
maybe 10 times .
but it didn &apos;t .
the data came in .
this is a great question .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
it has billions of them .
have you seen these guys ?
there &apos;s something else .
here &apos;s another example .
is it possible at all ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
ohhh .
and then it became international .
there were remixes .
let me summarize .
okay , some more .
the answer is no .
just keep on . a lot of fun .
my name is amuit .
he had the experience .
it gives you fresh .
this is a great question .
is that your opinion ?
nearly identical structure .
and it got better yet .
that &apos;s what she did .
it &apos;s got a lot of him .
here you see the city .
good afternoon , all together .
will i like the color ?
ooh , thank you .
some have come and gone .
i don &apos;t think so .
dk : 60,000 .
there &apos;s an old study .
not mutually bred .
the game is from 2007 .
that &apos;s not true of emotions .
it &apos;s called paul open .
now what did she believe ?
who &apos;s going to make it safe ?
first , we have the population .
i don &apos;t like that question .
but what do your fish eat ?
let &apos;s also call it a don &apos;t .
that &apos;s visual .
the work of the interpreter .
but where are we useful ?
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
how do we actually work people ?
... his own story .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
so what does that mean ?
now , what does that mean ?
privacy must be there .
there are online criminals .
we have three main groups .
there were still fish .
he always showed up here .
and then it happened again .
i felt really good .
and many people forget this .
crisis . death . disaster .
it would be intolerable .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
it &apos;s not our problem .
we &apos;ve lost contact the contact .
why not think that ?
we love technology and creativity .
it would be educated .
we &apos;re always pushing up .
and this opens a map .
but what do we do with this ?
that &apos;s about it .
what do i look at ?
his name is tempt .
will it be my size ?
that sounds crazy , right ?
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
we need to spread the message .
that &apos;s what most of you know .
you also need to understand that .
you see that down there .
i want to ask you something .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was destroyed on the ground .
this is what it looks like .
is it about the light ?
i grew up in india .
that &apos;s the short-term .
you see the water coming out .
i had a good life .
so what happened years after ?
who are these relatives ?
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
these changes are coming in .
what about fitness ?
this is the exciting thing .
but the key thing is ...
he &apos;s working torture .
and then they set up .
what happened there ?
the orange tractor .
they really loved it .
but i felt bad .
the two greeks called me .
woman : surplus technology .
very frightening .
what &apos;s the soul ?
we &apos;re not producing any more .
i can say anything .
he went down and went down .
what else can we do ?
this is what the graphics looked like .
now , i &apos;m coming to the end .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
it might sound evil .
we were 20 people .
so we &apos;re too many .
you can &apos;t have bones .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
or is it possible ?
conflicts come from conflicts .
so what do we need to do ?
they didn &apos;t have any books .
that &apos;s felix .
actually , i made two mistakes .
thank you for your attention .
that was the beginning of the journey .
i &apos;m frightening .
and then everybody went down .
they saw the great impact .
first extension , second .
well , i was the next one .
let &apos;s face it -- who &apos;s normal ?
and finally , epic meaning .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
the same thing , only bigger .
who &apos;s most successful ?
you want to feed the world ?
i wanted to support them .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
i just love two .
the one place is south korea .
again , they have it again .
this is a natural thing .
my wife told me .
and how did that feel ?
that &apos;s what you can train .
do you make the curiosity ?
so it &apos;s circle .
so what why now ?
this happened around christmas .
what is this thing for a thing ?
so , you know .
they could have done better .
the answer is yes .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
and this is not at all .
is that reasonable ?
so that &apos;s the good news .
it was a huge success .
so they saw something magic .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
five to one , great .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
but can &apos;t be a problem .
they always say , why ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
it wasn &apos;t just invented .
so , estrogen was supposed to work .
anyone know what that is ?
for example , this perception is in context .
this is a game for outside .
this is god , you know ?
but it was very sad .
so let me remind you .
the answer is no .
and it &apos;s the chart .
sometimes i get too straightforward .
but they &apos;re doing the job .
they &apos;re connected to these two people .
her mother moved on her own .
okay , there &apos;s some .
think about your own decisions .
this picture is from this place .
i see this signs .
and it took 18 months .
tell me about this world .
this is very risky .
and that worked very well .
again , he showed him four .
i learned everything out .
and there are hundreds of them .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there are good news .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
that made me really sad .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
but that &apos;s not how fast that goes .
how can we help you ? &quot;
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
no , no one had ever been .
the story is not over .
what happened on that day ?
well , we want to .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
so you feel good . &quot;
they come from the artists .
i should not say that .
the power plant can explode .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
they did it for three years .
you can have those cloud .
the data was not available before .
game is not silly .
now , how could this happen ?
is this all just education ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
so , we can .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
not very good at all .
play doesn &apos;t just play children .
and that was 19 years ago .
which one would you like most ?
they create a epic story .
they have so much uncertainty .
the data continues all the time .
nobody ever said that before .
so paul is a terrorist .
and this is what he actually says .
take nothing more than anywhere .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what should our permission look like ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
i &apos;ll never cook with that .
she was back and die .
and of course , this is incredible .
and here &apos;s the picture .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
a autistic student .
now , when it &apos;s garbage .
so not like detox .
and that &apos;s all we &apos;re taking .
we depend on two countries .
everybody needs a goldfish .
let me be a picture . &quot;
people were still happy .
it was my first sunlight .
in fact , he gathered fish .
my name is brian goldman .
they share their experiences with others .
the white lines are for population .
that &apos;s why i made the movie .
he showed up on the algae .
it &apos;s just not technological .
there are four and a half thousand people .
and already , you have a problem .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
each case is nutritious .
and so we &apos;re too many .
so the question is : how ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and it was an incredible experience .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
but there are two problems .
i started feeling better .
but , you know what ?
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
that &apos;s true .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
we &apos;re in an area .
and that &apos;s what we did .
basically , they do the same thing .
so this is one of the images .
what other brands do ?
and then something funny happened .
you can play with different ways .
the whole building was made of water .
italy wins . yeah .
on the morning , before the game .
that would not have been a problem at all .
the creativity had to get out of it .
today , everything is easy to have .
the nurse asked the nurse .
i probably shouldn &apos;t .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
and it starts with a doctor .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
we use the energy of the sun .
these are all metadata .
because i can say anything .
it &apos;s always going to be similar .
slowly , but surely it did .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work , right ?
what are they trying to do ? &quot;
further than that we don &apos;t .
what do we have learned ?
and the shape plays a role .
you can &apos;t store energy .
then i can translate this whole thing .
okay , that &apos;s really what makes the courage .
once we started a vivid .
my second mistake was worse .
and they beat a 257 .
we all love baseball , right ?
somehow , children don &apos;t do that anymore .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
they become free in the computer .
because anybody here has masks ?
and then he realizes him .
other things should not suffer .
this has the largest impact .
the movement , to write it .
anyway , to navigate .
and that &apos;s very much the beginning .
the truth is more like this .
do you want to delete jeans ?
so you can &apos;t do anything like this .
and his response was &quot; yes . &quot;
her family gathered .
thank you for your patience .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
what else is risky ?
be easy to see who they are .
i remember my first fire .
what is a story about ?
dark in dark . dark .
i was trying to get a little more exciting .
but very effective and effective , right ?
but we need the whole thing .
nuclear missions , right ?
that &apos;s completely tricky .
let &apos;s leave that quiet .
hmmm , my brand ?
this is scary .
that sounds frightening .
next , nuclear energy .
also a very exciting phenomenon .
i really wanted to make normal at that time .
so this is what i &apos;m going to show you now .
as soon as the judge saw me .
we can &apos;t just do that .
so i went to court .
i got something fear of technology .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
and there are several reasons for this .
they sell certificate .
it &apos;s not documented , but it &apos;s not documented .
why did i go to medicine ?
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s spreading rapidly .
all adults were aware of the risks .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i like things that are different .
i went to jail -- difficult .
that made my eyes no sense .
this is a car game , right ?
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
and this video is in real time .
the game starts at switzerland .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
what about longevity ?
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
so the correlation is low .
so , look what happens .
so the dynamic really changed .
so i just started playing games .
and then we said , okay .
yes , that &apos;s the kind of data .
i &apos;m shooting through the head .
have you ever been aggregated ?
this is like learning .
because for me , it means memory .
how and what does he feel ?
we &apos;re saying in germany .
so you can &apos;t fix that .
music is medicine . music changes us .
it turns out it &apos;s really difficult to figure out .
and you know what i learned ?
these will be discontradiction .
but what will happen in the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
that has nothing to do with science .
and that can make a huge difference .
but there &apos;s another reason .
anyway , we need a solution .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
i could draw . i could draw .
so i stop , thank you very much .
they fought the channels .
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
we started this 15 years ago .
how far do you get there ?
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
do you know what &apos;s up ?
so the first step in a interpretation .
and there &apos;s still no interpretation .
that has to be the difference .
if you come to that , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
that &apos;s just the minimum .
we can regain our nutrients .
anyone know what three seconds are ?
on the book and on the image .
this image reminded me of something .
i think it &apos;s very abundant .
sunlight and co2 are a method --
but maybe this is not the case .
and what does this mean for designers ?
i want to prove it to you .
it was a pretty widespread project .
here he leaves the sun .
this is what the stores look like .
these rivers take rivers .
a has this benefits and risks .
our magazines are read by millions .
lego made it possible for everyone .
privacy is not to debate .
they were genetically engineered .
i &apos;m the new doctor .
i don &apos;t take the same lost .
baseball is full of great statistics .
because we live on a water planet .
do we really want to go this way ?
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
and these are the neural structures .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
oh , my time is over ?
something increases in me .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
so we measured his movement .
this is a picture of the object .
apparently it was very popular .
you see something fun here .
i really like to like beautiful clothes .
he can only use his eyes .
but the truth is far away .
you can do this all the time .
so this crazy story could be called .
who would ever wish one ?
the defeat would have been too easy .
her father died soon after her birth .
one year we didn &apos;t have a cent .
we need to increase the complexity .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
here &apos;s her martire .
it &apos;s the experience .
but then you really want to get deep inside .
you want to be in the museum ?
that was more to concrete .
okay , do you really know that ?
and i had to get out of the city .
we won some prices .
who doesn &apos;t want to healthier children ?
it &apos;s making cheese with children .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
no , i &apos;m really serious .
i hold the knife in my hand .
and the goal is quite simple .
i go back to my sleeve .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
now i see greg moon .
a billion people are going to be hungry today .
do you do that for the children ? &quot;
i loved that fish .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and this sounds very different than before .
he was already over seventy-six .
i started an institute .
they even get funded funding .
the film hasn &apos;t yet launched .
we need to think , which marks .
what do you do with this ? &quot;
i call this the bright tiger .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 .
it &apos;s not necessarily bad .
this is ideology , not science .
and that got me through this way .
today , 6.8 billion people .
very simple , so it &apos;s going to come .
it &apos;s busy with shame .
the hot project today .
automatically , he &apos;s running the right idea .
that &apos;s how natural things are .
but it requires a lot of planning .
we can reinvent it all the time .
in a way , we think of north .
and the phosphorus phosphorus .
often the third one is forgotten .
for longer than those other networks .
the rocks are colored .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
it &apos;s about changing values .
i started with my usual talk .
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
i learned this from my grandmother .
now we &apos;re doing that with airplanes .
how do i remove them ? &quot;
we haven &apos;t written this app .
and every morning i jump on that .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
that &apos;s more than 250 .
the peers are very good .
what about words would you describe ?
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
there are worlds also in the world .
to ask , what &apos;s the right thing ?
people over the course of the urine .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes .
the living ones are the spirits .
they gave their blood pressure up .
thank you , but the best part is still coming .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of equilibrium .
happy productivity . fantastic !
the result of this was catastrophic .
and everybody in this room has to come in .
here &apos;s the olive oil .
bjn sundin .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
&quot; risk is not a simple game .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
we already have a lot of procedures .
this is probably what &apos;s going to be a publicly leashes .
my brother stared at me .
these are the apple sarso .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
who could have imagined this ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who do you actually want to inform ?
completely on a particular goal .
what do you think happens next ?
they have . they always have them .
so this is a harnessness .
it &apos;s also a constant .
they literally switched the lever .
&quot; the best in the business . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
most of all , if he died .
so it &apos;s going to get two circles .
the byproduct is clean water .
it sounds like an unusual time .
we built unique elements here .
you lose and rare animals .
it &apos;s going to touch them deeply .
he died , broken through the story .
here you can see how the building works .
they were searching for each other .
tell them what they feel .
the other one had strong breakthrough .
let &apos;s do a little set of picture .
here you have this little mechanism .
there he &apos;s signed up .
the interest of the design is for firemen .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
the students are divided after notes .
these things are correct .
and here you feel it already .
i noticed that for a while , for power , that was one .
i &apos;ve tried to understand them .
all of these generations need a few milliseconds .
and nobody seems to get upset about it .
that i wrote these crazy things .
so the men can &apos;t be pigs .
this is just a little bit less destroying .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn to learn .
this is also a paradigm shift .
a dalmatiness , exactly .
you can see from the back to the front .
so from the modern in the computer society .
and that &apos;s what they do .
we need to get far and fast .
it &apos;s about a new fear of america .
they are all invite questions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they &apos;re the home countries of someone .
we &apos;re walking through initiational rituals .
now look at this curve .
lewis are simply belong to our lives .
i meet people in death cells .
they were inspired to be inspired by that .
leaders might have some mutations .
so scott gets this fruit .
we worked in the late night .
so i followed my gut feeling .
he moved back to the silence .
now we saw the reverse effect .
politely , everybody has applauded .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
so ... doesn &apos;t mean optimistic .
it turns out it works off .
let &apos;s face it .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
they had a concept of blue blood .
i believed everyone could do that .
i never met him personally .
even cats look at this video .
there was jimmy kima .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
how would you describe your brand ?
we &apos;re talking about cool , fresh .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
no , that was what i thought i was .
i &apos;m a redundant person .
that &apos;s not the route .
this is a painting of a circle .
the roof was also covered with water .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
and women argued the successfully .
we can support them to be good .
look at what it does .
the main man to me .
sexual reproduction goes into the picture .
i read to you the contract .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
that &apos;s the truth . i believe that .
we &apos;re talking about olpesian .
it was really immensely profound .
he shaped his head , no .
this will happen in the next april .
we also have very detailed data .
behind the seven mountains and so forth .
the mechanism is from the gap .
but with the right design , please .
we can support them to be good .
to say , what &apos;s information ?
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
there was never a time like this .
and even lg borg thinks around .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
also , these under-ruptures are underlying .
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
this is an ecologist network .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
the chef had burned him .
you &apos;re supposed to kick out .
this is such a neutral component .
that &apos;s what &apos;s just been represented .
what do you think 20 milliseconds ?
i see the dalmatiness .
it might be up until it &apos;s invited .
maybe again , again , a glimpse of it .
no , no , far feather .
and this image was taken by atlas .
156 of nations send our tv channel .
they called their internet connection .
but today we are far beyond that .
she wasn &apos;t drunk .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
this is the system where we live .
but i kept asking these questions .
and that was what i felt .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
you should also wish the wishes .
something very strange happens here .
and that was the outbreak of the .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
it can know how we hold it .
so it creates a feedback .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
this is a humble little app .
this is from one other place .
&quot; they didn &apos;t let them go . &quot;
i lived in parallel space .
someone made an old-fashioned version of it .
and i &apos;d like to read you the lecture .
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
you can be logical and intuitive .
tell me a little bit about this part .
make it possible -- all of you here .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
does anybody even know what that is ?
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
it &apos;s called &quot; jumping with me . &quot;
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , these conditions don &apos;t exist in us .
we &apos;ll come back to this people later .
we can chase ourselves like this .
so the first exciting primate .
and there &apos;s some sort of staff staff .
daniel kahneman : sure .
everyone would like to make people happier .
also the dosification plays a role .
and why ? genetic changed .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
we have now in this country .
not even the truth , it &apos;s free .
because now you can apply a three-sentence .
you see the timeline up .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
but it &apos;s not just the words .
thank you , danny kaman .
we &apos;re getting an absolutely flat line .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
because we don &apos;t want to shoot genes ?
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t do that much .
they understand the process , they understand him .
there &apos;s a lot of things that need to come together .
and what do you do with the waste ?
bad ? i was completely confused .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and then he can walk away from that .
a beautiful story , like i mean .
his personal stories of the seal .
i &apos;m going to try this for one person .
it &apos;s got to work out as a present .
but we &apos;re starting to see change .
this is a year &apos;s water stream .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
now this level of intuition is very important .
so littlettes is open source .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
they grow five inches .
maybe i did it with a good reason .
&quot; a pink blue dot . &quot;
now let &apos;s take something else out .
it &apos;s all coming out of our own pockets .
normal people aren &apos;t available these devices . &quot;
as an artist , the context is very important .
here you see roberto dance .
and no matter what italy did at the end .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
but the game is a formula .
thank you . i have a question .
he had 20 minutes of music .
well , then i &apos;m going to show you .
this is just an insurance method .
it should reconcile the two elements .
shake the environment , make less garbage .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m about to talk about .
yes . she doesn &apos;t do anything but discover .
the goal of the movie is transparency .
a language is the expression of the human spirit .
it was a grouper .
what you need is a new medical culture .
alone , shame and without support .
do you want to come in and listen ? &quot;
i think our identity is threatened .
a lot of my clients are very young .
my cousins were all around .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
there are two different jets out there .
now , who &apos;s ready for that journey .
i have him on my laptop here . &quot;
i &apos;m going to negotiate with artists .
a whole very cool food .
the difference is perceived as a loss .
in two hours , it works all over the place .
the emergency room dropped out of all strands .
no insurance can make a quest .
there are lots of great books on this topic .
so this was a problem for supercomputer .
this country is different from 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
you can predict that . why is that ?
what kind of application do i do ?
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
isn &apos;t it half or a quarter ? &quot;
so what can we get out of all this ?
so basically a translation of translation .
no tree is carbon neutral .
and further , now you see him .
the next step is now at this communities .
he had a lot of natural videos .
this is actually just the labor of the work .
two minutes later , three things happened .
thank you very much , very much .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
that really solves the fueling problem .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
this is one , part of her .
it just didn &apos;t come out , you know ?
in other areas -- the world of communication .
this is my supermarket . no big .
but western governments are also helping themselves .
sleep manual is ubiquitous .
i &apos;m going to tide , as we all do .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
if you burn coal , no .
tell me , there &apos;s no predictable .
can you play it in blue ?
no , we &apos;re stuck in there .
and there &apos;s a central point of this .
i mean , everybody &apos;s eaten .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
now what are the archaic models ?
and the list can be continued .
so , that &apos;s my primary motivation .
refreshing america . find out more .
and the problem isn &apos;t the technology .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we wondered , and nobody knew it .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
monday : color is something more powerful .
it &apos;s shaped us .
and then it looks like this .
do you remember the wind even ?
so help me a little bit of this .
imagine mozart in efficient .
i &apos;m happy that i &apos;m there .
the amount of water is degraded .
they care about that .
man 3 : i &apos;m the museum of museum .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a lip pen .
meanwhile , the instruments have evolved .
i just want to explain a little bit about that .
in fact , a viral video didn &apos;t want to make viral video .
in this three-sentence , three sentences come in front of them .
thirty phrase is still from school .
you can zoom in and zoom in .
now i add a bass .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
if you don &apos;t , somebody else &apos;s jellyfish today .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
they laughed more than they do here .
your problem is that you have too little .
thirdly , local expectations .
the official dogma of what ?
you &apos;re just listening to and then you start talking .
let me show you how they work .
it &apos;s a game called folding .
i call them &quot; the bottom billion . &quot;
we &apos;re thinking about energy systems today .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
you go around and you flush yourself .
you just have to get it as much as possible .
imagine a plane full of rings too .
that means something in the city is built .
second time . the normal game time .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
imagine that for a moment .
raise your hands . let me see you .
maybe we can see the change as a change .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
people lit . people were fighting .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
you know that science is not a company .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so that really blew me up .
i tried to preserve the body .
life hasn &apos;t changed since centuries .
but there were so many of them available over the years .
my grandmother has never forgotten his life .
my fourth technology : predictions of complexity .
third technology : categorization .
it includes a thousand square miles .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
you should tell me something about my brand .
it was something that we knew to do .
but reality is always unpredictable .
the summer was a happy summer , 2006 .
thurnerd : self-confidence is the key .
it &apos;s in the back of our body .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
i wanted to restore the health of a disease .
now , if you think a little bit further .
what ? that really took me out .
we &apos;re restoring genetic food .
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
we have them forced . puff .
my parents are the 80 on the ferences .
and there &apos;s the ladder problem .
it &apos;s the most powerful human trait .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drink information . &quot;
you can jump directly to a certain outcome .
you can dive into a particular year .
because that &apos;s tired of evidence , right ?
shake the environment , less energy .
this is what &apos;s called the osit-in model .
now you see the dalmaer .
and the last one is also here today .
yeah , i &apos;m scared of all these things .
this one needs to go down , zero .
but i didn &apos;t let myself discourage .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
astonishingly , he still was delicious .
and over time , they can react to other people .
our goal was to say , okay .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go back again .
all of them are composable .
but everything that &apos;s in there is useful .
this is going to be in china in a second .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
anyway , they do that in the case .
the permanent ice is labeled with red .
and if not , dance is yet your dance .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
seriously -- the gang on the wage .
now , this cartoon makes some exceptions .
here &apos;s a couple on the hampton .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
i thought i could integrate myself .
we still think they &apos;re initially originally .
the three words louder : do you remember ?
i remember it when it was yesterday .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
well , i cheated the courtyard .
i said , &quot; ok , oma . &quot;
we &apos;re in the middle of this transience .
i work in the solar state of technology .
and let me show you a simple example .
but it has an unexpected cost .
so that made sense , it was appropriate .
yet we seem to be very pleased with this .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
scott himself thought of human being .
and here , every piece is very good .
after that , it &apos;s about the combination of the various images .
is it about the details or the colors ?
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
nobody has to be able to fool ideas .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
i think maybe i &apos;ve heard more hands .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
eee ! no , thank you .
and this is a millionaire .
so this is where we need digital systems .
so again , the fit was really good together .
the internet and services of it is a miracle .
it &apos;s a lot of different shapes .
so they go out ; they save the shoes .
this is about one percent of the population .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
what we want is to create the future .
i don &apos;t get into the real feedback of this feedback .
there &apos;s a lot of very happy coaching .
let me show you .
it &apos;s like a potatoes .
damaged . shame . shame .
we &apos;ve gotten rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
they were just like the people in this room .
my grandparents failed this number to 70 .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
we need to use more research for us .
there &apos;s every footprint there .
i would normally take the needle out .
there &apos;s somebody sitting there who didn &apos;t have childhood .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand that .
let &apos;s do it as if we had a machine here .
what happened to these design students ?
this is going to be a key part of this toolbox .
they live help from chemosynthesis .
i was totally enthusiastic , you know .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue .
and every night , they fly 240 miles back .
every morning , they fly 240 miles to the farm .
how does the feed be ? &quot;
natural light then offers smart smarts .
no one &apos;s ever done on the world .
picasso , wait , wait .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
that the topic of ecology is a global place .
now i &apos;m going to do something else about it .
they &apos;re all on their way back .
and they had to remove what we did .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we just signed it down .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
that &apos;s how you can &apos;t get them wrong .
what do you do with certificate ?
this is alfred de gonzz .
there can be a consequence of change .
and this is very important in the medical research .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
what would you say to someone who believes ?
then he got me into the ear .
the rest of the time , they &apos;re occurring .
i start with some simple examples .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
the question is , why people accept this .
and i got back to work .
it &apos;s going to be linked by oxygen and silicon .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
and then i wonder , how could this happen ?
first of all , i thought that was a game .
the storyteller always needs more senses .
and try this whole again with another generation .
today , a lot of people put up the government .
next week , that comes out on the market .
she &apos;s got a button of a button .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
i mean , no one has ever seen a particles .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
the first is a classic , apple .
it &apos;s the way i &apos;d like to be .
these things have a positive effect .
no one wanted to do something with the film .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
on the left , you see a little boat .
so i think we need to be leaders .
so we have this terrible simplistic idea .
so two pairs , each of them is a baby .
ladies and gentlemen , their relatives .
it &apos;s only the only test of survival and success .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
it was the imagination beyond the imagination .
but the best part is -- in a second .
so each concert is a different concert .
so not saving , avoiding , avoiding .
and all of this is packaging or content .
i could park in front of my house . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
they &apos;re supporting other people &apos;s miseries .
i put them on the treatment .
do you know how to call a 400th ?
notice two things about that curve .
and i have to say , there was power .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
at 16 , i started to illustrate books .
that our contribution to the system is to vote .
there had to be another piece of legend .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
he &apos;s not out in other countries .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
i never want to make a difference in life .
so i talked a few months later at a conference .
so they communicate -- this is how their fingers go along .
i want to show you something first .
and of course , it &apos;s got cliff .
it was summer , and i had a shock .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
and they &apos;re not just going to die of masses .
what happened is we could do that .
they don &apos;t invest in power time .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
these are absolutely logical and correct .
anyway , that &apos;s what i want to do in every case .
technical circle , there &apos;s just as well .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge to nine .
i &apos;ve taken him this particular one .
the beginning of the tribal society is through language .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside of people .
we don &apos;t invent identity , we invent it .
it was a lot of los , and i was in the wool .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
now everybody &apos;s trying to figure out something from this pattern .
he came to me and hugged me .
all of those who were like this started to divide .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
i &apos;m really sorry . does that make you crazy ?
the country on the land would roll it up .
so smarter , a giant topic .
and we want to make this material available for all of us .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
we want something against death penalty companies .
there are some interesting developments .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet , a realistic level is realistic .
so the theme of the day : saving money .
in fact , no , that was not the mistake at all .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
and we still need to improve a lot of that device .
it happened four and a half years ago in italy .
and i would argue that this is good .
this is a problem that many players have .
the last three of the five i &apos;ve summarized .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
storage those rejects the rest .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
all right , what &apos;s the brand german ?
i want to help you , to calm down .
they &apos;re both survival , both of them .
as i said , amanda , our elephant .
there was no canoe petri melts .
have you taken all the vitamins this morning ?
so this was a very strange experience .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
all of these windmills are loving .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
the only thing that was her head .
so for him , they were just clear .
i &apos;m wearing jeans almost all the time .
this is a dead turtle .
so i think this is my brand .
i &apos;ve got something that i want to show you .
how would it be longer to live in good health ?
we don &apos;t want companies to patent companies .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
they have the flow of the water reverse .
so , we can &apos;t do these things at all .
in the countries where people come to money .
and what does it look like ?
we understood that the weather is global .
and in this head , the memory was remembering .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is a completely unhalfway pattern .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
everyone in my tennis neighborhood is gone .
that means we need to get phosphorus .
well , would you choose the same vacation ?
there seems to be an imperative .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
think about that . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
now they understood the advantage of the prototyping .
that &apos;s what the u.s. does for hundreds of years .
i think first of the curiosity is curiosity .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
but maybe you can also agree with them .
but today , we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
not everything should be compatible .
if you fall in love , efficient ?
and we see that it &apos;s made of yellow .
because it doesn &apos;t really feel real money .
yeah , so what should biohacking be ?
here are some people who test it .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
there are the ones that are much more spatial .
the main headquarters is right here .
i thought he was kidney .
and feedback to my doctor &apos;s office .
and we also saw this in mobile phones .
we want the number of chiefs .
the silent thing is concrete .
the dutch of dna was an interesting step .
people seem to think about politics is sexy .
but what happens to me is different .
i was not familiar with the labels .
no apple ever swallowed it like this .
good night , sweet thylacine . &quot;
now he &apos;s got a tractor in the scene .
and they also feel like their movements and their tendency .
if your job is dance , dance .
so we accused about 50 of the magnets .
these are images about a duration of six seconds .
but nevertheless , there &apos;s not always such a bad thing .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
they become rare because we catch them .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of preferences .
all of these things are inevitable .
we have access to access to exponential technology .
i remember it as if it was yesterday .
and i &apos;m going to be a character in the book .
tell , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
so each of the droplet was slightly different .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
i put my task on 95 kilograms .
so i think the ground is very simple .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
we found it was really strange .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
the answer is probably going to be no .
do you know how many people look at this tedtalks ?
because otherwise our problem is even bigger .
this is something like our camoufi .
so they can pull the whole movement off .
here &apos;s the results that we just got .
but how do you do that in practice ?
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
i don &apos;t want to do it by dying . &quot;
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
that &apos;s the problem i try to solve .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
and they ask : what happens to these moments ?
... that the dodo is a role of play .
probably many of you in this room .
yes , they &apos;re right . we &apos;ll fix that .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
now , i understand that . i do .
the marshmallow needs to be on the top .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
these blocks are not bringing us a money .
i can make the sequence as they walk around .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
for nathaniel means music .
yes , we have a business model .
and the question is , why haven &apos;t you ?
because actually , this person is not interested in forum .
because without those lifespans , we can &apos;t live .
he &apos;s just blowing them and not himself .
why do i have to afford this little car ?
a phrase with his own breath .
the interpretation is barely spoken in the beginner class .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
and in my teenage , i said , expectation .
it &apos;s kind of an act of missile .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
or they didn &apos;t have a photo tography .
and this leads us to a big question .
they virtual reality the reality and the computer without computers .
yeah , what do we do now ?
and the world in which we lived like this .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
if you generalize it , this is what happens .
and that was not a very hard diagnosis .
i was a obsessed obsessional student .
all right , really good , maybe a everyday star .
empathy , not debt , affecting the outcome .
she had the last word in every other surf .
the transition happens . we can all feel it .
and we use this word with this representative .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and it worked . it worked out for scott .
i met the decision to raise the u.s. .
we don &apos;t want to try and tell the future before .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times viewed .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
this is just online -- no press , no tv .
or are they more like a downhill ?
what &apos;s next about you want to talk about .
so what are we going to see in the film ?
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
i want to tell you how we found that out .
and that &apos;s the planning behind ximum .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature &apos;s nature .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
look , dr. kean has changed .
it &apos;s natasha , and it &apos;s just natasha .
we have the passion of an innovators .
this is moore &apos;s law last hundred years .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
we want to create mass indoors . &quot;
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
now we do that with drilling and machines .
this is the center for service and information .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
we all have navigated systems in our cars .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
all right , let me show you a little more of it .
here we were , and this is the painting .
emc : &quot; you &apos;re welcome transparency . &quot;
there were a lot of crazy things going on .
the avian age of the machine age .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same thing with the disabled movement .
but are we going to make the best of our play game ?
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
but one of them is much worse than the other .
but do you know what they don &apos;t have right ?
i thought we &apos;re going to use the polls .
there &apos;s a connection , a reciprocal respect .
and so i then met a slightly unusual decision .
so my two passions .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
i had a relationship with this beauty of a number of months .
i don &apos;t know who you know this picture .
i &apos;ll just agree that &apos;s logical .
i care about making a comparison .
the question of death penalty is an interesting question .
i &apos;m really excited about this kid .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamics .
al is a hydrant in the city .
today i &apos;m going to report unexpected discoveries .
the underwater part comes from a stone age .
when i say reality , i mean photo .
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
and what was that for you ? what is it that successful ?
a little bit more about them , they &apos;re not .
it was &quot; eternal , forever . &quot;
tuesday : adapting is totally overrated .
the dog ! i was sleepy .
would you like to be attractive and self-conscious ?
she was barely breathing and blue .
people in the door are now coming in .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
you need that , and we don &apos;t give it to you .
and some of it works , and some of it doesn &apos;t work .
so we &apos;re going to walk before , and where are we going ?
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
but the phosphorus is not going to be able to replace .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
we wanted to develop a learning tool for language learning .
i may have another 40 years in me .
now you know what the answer to this question is ?
if you want to build hyperlinks between the images .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not perceived as a loss .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
this is the kind of educational bushes .
now , there &apos;s also a lot of studies on this .
and we &apos;re learning to trust and the rules of play .
probably one of those numbers has to come close to zero .
and i said , &quot; yes , very much . &quot;
you can say things that have influence around the world .
... you could just quickly show the slide .
in the same way , i think we &apos;re putting together a games today .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be an aid doctor .
and i went over and i just heard .
it also turns out to be in other places of the book .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
these results were done by several weeks of hard work .
this player is short before a episode .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s coming out ? &quot;
there &apos;s a program that may know some .
i &apos;m very grateful for the catalyst here .
you probably know that he was 35 here .
and yet we still don &apos;t understand the possibilities of it .
my mother suffered from the boat from the boat .
these are the people that shape my view .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the border .
we see this in all kinds of human life .
and it was also after the three months .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent-m .
the main problem here is kind of like aids .
the logic doesn &apos;t say about reality .
have a nice concrete example .
then i say , heartbreak , yes ?
and we &apos;re often going to reinvent the way we want .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re going to bring kids to the world .
his whole labor of labor has changed after that .
i said , &quot; promises , oma . &quot;
it &apos;s worthy and strange programs .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
but the one thing that says this picture is a problem .
there are some places we can do .
we called it the digital water .
because they have special skills of processing processing .
so here are some natural light bulbs .
the second factor is the services we use .
it changed my way of making films completely , completely .
it &apos;s hard to monitor the destruction .
so you could feel like you could sell it .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul appears .
that means that ants weigh much more than we do .
and that &apos;s what we like to look at now .
geh and jellyfish cohen .
so , go ahead and start invading it .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
that &apos;s an idea worth spreading .
imagine that only two other small changes .
how many would be a good memory ?
and that &apos;s the kind of bike message .
so listen , please , when a music is played .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what &apos;s going on .
the first two sentences that are correct .
in fact , we know that something else is the case .
now this should not be a joke , but it should be joke .
go ahead and do that , and then you learn the sentence .
we can do these things to different examples .
what we love is , that &apos;s the highlands .
they moved to a natural engineering concept .
so these women met , and they just sat down .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so he got the citizens to check it .
and we have a package design .
darling and sponsors were sponsored .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzles of the puzzle .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you zoe . you can actually go in .
you can see in all these museums here .
how much money do you need to realize that ?
think about that . this reef is generic .
and if it doesn &apos;t , it doesn &apos;t actually do anything .
so we start with a wind-up drunk .
he says , &quot; willingness to do all this . &quot;
imagine a soundscape .
it &apos;s a totally denial of miseries .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move on .
this is another view on the tree of life .
they divided the kingdom into two seats .
this is one of the classic expressions in play .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
we didn &apos;t have children in this country yesterday .
and i &apos;ve spent a while trying to figure that out .
we repeated this practice with the same students .
you have to be willing to take risks on themselves .
&quot; look at your bloody , pink .
there &apos;s no overpopulation problem .
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
and the third area that actually explains itself .
i &apos;m looking forward to the conversations of all of you .
every big picture is the dawn of a shut .
you wouldn &apos;t want to starve , and you know what ?
or are they more like a downhill ?
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
that &apos;s the consequence that we need to make .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more dangerous .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i said , &quot; please fly in the air . &quot;
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
play is the tickle that holds us .
if you have something to give , you give it to it now .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
they teach them how to open doors .
antony : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
and here are two patients . these are their records .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive cognitive event .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
so , a climate change is going to be terrible for you .
i &apos;ll just show you the new york times website .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as a designer .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
but the volume are much larger than ever before .
it grows in winter and shrunk in summer .
not just bad , but the worst ever .
everyone knew their genius something was a little loaf .
we repair them , repair them .
and the world in which we now look like this .
but these are all the streets in the u.s. .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
child mortality is about a tenth of a tenth .
this is also because that &apos;s coming back .
ok , it &apos;s something that &apos;s half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s not one idea ; it &apos;s a process .
and you know what my answer to all of this is ?
we walk into the arms of the placebo industry .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
where is the greatest interest of what &apos;s really going on ?
and also , the episode of energy is very important .
we went back to the titanic .
because artists have a broken relationship to the lie .
and at all , you &apos;ve got a lot less than i do .
or , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
i &apos;m never going to play as much as in this moment .
it &apos;s the form of recession , right ?
and less usable or friendly friendly .
how can i make something possible to use ?
i don &apos;t see why this shouldn &apos;t be like that .
so how do we work when we look at this ?
every society is shaped by a primary means .
and these interactive portraits are true to each other .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation .
you may have heard that we built watersheds .
and it &apos;s also deeply rooted in our lives .
they get a model made out of the whole world .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
the only problem that was that she had 10 children .
so in other words , i first want to do what i want to do .
and i see the same process in combining photos .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it became almost 200 million times a year .
they had 348 different types of brands .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction to it .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
he described one of them as a very usually .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
on one spot , the screen swallows over .
so the professional tasmanian movement has done it .
and there are projects like this at any level of government .
this year , almost 50 million times viewed .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some of the possible solutions .
the faces of the audience were very serious and sam .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
we should put the bakery in the cage .
are you mindfulness and monsoon as 7 ?
the life support itself has no voice in this election .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
and in the world , everything was made sense to me .
well the next day , we were in cleveland .
dane , at a moment of headquarters .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
so gender can come up in many different varieties .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
and no , it &apos;s not modest or san francisco .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open the doors ?
here &apos;s the current version of this one-to-one .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
and this was sort of the first people of developed games .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships on .
you never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen rarely flat lines .
i take that hand . and here &apos;s the knife .
and the film is called &quot; the star confronts . &quot;
now , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in that ?
well , we put the mayor up .
now , today we know everything about where our things come from .
france makes a power . italy makes a tor .
how do you judge people based on their character ?
well , chimps are known for their aggressive .
he picks every five of my consciousness out of my consciousness .
is it money for other people , or is it affecting us ?
so i say , &quot; the world &apos;s changing games ! &quot;
edward caova is a volcanic scientist .
we currently spend three billion hours a week playing online with online .
the biggest difference between them is the time .
we tried to get to the top of the machine .
bg : a energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
and i say , &quot; sorry , don &apos;t even have one .
with pivot , you can dive into a decade .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
so i &apos;ve been running lots of fish in my life .
i understood that this is the art of art .
in fact , the notes are very vague and inexplicable .
because we &apos;re not doing things anymore .
it &apos;s going to be more like my glasses .
as i said , doubt , it just started .
this is a interactive filtration .
and breaks ! for despite the fact that you do .
i &apos;m going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and everybody knew it worked like this , right ?
i would keep doing this work that i love .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
here it says , &quot; yield your fingers on every light . &quot;
the next step was to find the apps for it .
we know one more thing where all the stations are going .
so you &apos;re just going to go to google &apos;s project .
what else do you have in the orphanage ?
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money looking great .
this constant feedback doesn &apos;t exist in real life .
i &apos;m going to explain it for you , and then explain it .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
a research move to the topic of design .
i &apos;m also going to resolve out what &apos;s in there .
you know , they don &apos;t know anything in this goldfish . &quot;
and then we offer one of those great things .
in the future , most crime are going to be online .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
now it &apos;s on the red list of endangered species .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
but i really believe that after we &apos;ve got something else .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of this communities .
the cell communities began to abstract information again .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital physical thing .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacine .
&quot; it &apos;s not about wishes .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the steck .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together .
also urban designers and designers are very interested in this .
there &apos;s not even online . there &apos;s no stretch .
so that doesn &apos;t work for the memory itself .
our steps on the digitization of life were exponentially .
that &apos;s star night , probably never seen that before .
over the course of this journey , i learned a lot .
as a child , i constantly drew comic books and so on .
when we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
that &apos;s right now our test target .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i &apos;m not always doing things .
we used alberries just around like otherwise .
a lot of talk from a 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
i was quite a little bit obsessed with studying the deep sea .
so if there &apos;s no soul , there &apos;s no soul .
this is the hardest part of my talk , by the way .
i can &apos;t play that way today in 20 years .
both of these are nailed to me , framed me .
so much testosterone , but no response to that .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my face .
11th is the highest thing i saw .
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
that &apos;s why we think of the weights as something .
these are spaces that can respond to intelligent people .
now , how do people die in such a hack ?
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
i sell a museum in the entire country around the world .
this is my meat , and i can flip that around .
this is the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
no , that &apos;s exactly the right thing , right ?
many of you are covered by faces .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
in both cases , it was done , and it was fine to them .
she didn &apos;t have any treatments of the brain damage .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
and the fish was also lucky enough to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
it was the malignant train against drug injection .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
there &apos;s even more on it , it &apos;s still deeper .
but we only know a little bit about where things go .
ok , imagine how the extreme self-motivating self-motivating .
i know what people think when they see that .
ask questions , ask the evidence , raise your desire .
i said , &quot; chickens pellets ? &quot;
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
as it did earlier , on the village happened .
this is what &apos;s happening in the gen-making machine age .
in our country , there is a political argument in our country .
she loses them on the beatles machine .
and yet , there is this mental dispersal .
she could find her within a time-learning framework .
... it &apos;s the crowdsource regret .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
i &apos;ve been working in a coal mining plant -- dangerous .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there was mumck-root and he meant that ?
that means going back to the ground .
so like a human being with certain kinds of things .
and of course , as well as design influence .
it &apos;s a disaster for the lower two billion , but it &apos;s a disaster .
it &apos;s just breathtaking .
lawyer : i &apos;m a lawyer .
we have a abstract abstract language .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
but actually it was at that night a lot more fun .
we had to worry about the lawyers &apos; forests .
it was called &quot; automatically hyde stone . &quot;
in fact , it &apos;s a certificate .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was even different .
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to be ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it ?
it &apos;s slowed down for one of our big problems .
we see the process of feeding itself .
thylacines ? yes . alive ? yuck .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we &apos;re doing .
but they can combine something special like this .
it &apos;s really about combining different realities .
because the images eat it for them to recommend .
whales and wumms , you &apos;re in this museum .
the idea is to become a digital security system .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
we can put that time machine on everything we want .
it &apos;s a debate about words , metametaphors .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
in fact , the progression of society based on energy advances .
this was not a film , not hd , that was real .
i was not there at all time with miguel .
because you know , that &apos;s a funny process .
have you ever seen a cliff tree ?
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i just described .
when you get too far away , go together . &quot;
refreshing america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
frozen , the carbon man is cleaned every day .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
so i step back and look at the other way .
i filmed in war areas -- difficult and dangerous .
so we should soon find better out what the goal is .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
when we &apos;re making cities , this is actually a big thing .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
in other words , play is our adaptation .
can you imagine something good that comes out of tobacco ?
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds of their pain .
you can just name some names , and people will understand .
ph.d. , tubes , shops , shops ...
this is a variant of one that was done .
now , the episode of energy is about time .
and it was an experience that couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the movie .
it caused immense juveniles in the control room .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
he said , &quot; the skin seems like a sponge .
it &apos;s this encoded , coordinated taste .
the shrimp eats the phytoplankton .
and so he &apos;s flying his elderly .
and then a whole bunch of simulations .
however , that was not like that in the azi years .
the music purity is the extension of our body .
he lived only three and a half years .
hey , puma , do you really want to seriously ?
a baby takes about a sixth of a baby .
so i know some of the things that didn &apos;t wear .
this is already a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
in 25 years , it will be gone from here to here .
it &apos;s like somebody who swallows the sun .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s going on here .
this is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
but then i thought , you know what , we &apos;re honest .
what we need are many companies who work on it . hundreds of these .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la la la thma .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
bruno usseli : thank you very much . thank you .
i have a friend who &apos;s driving a passenger .
it &apos;s not just a nice soundscape .
and because we &apos;re getting older , the wind is going to get larger .
this is the time when you fall in love .
and we &apos;re still very , very strong stories .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and the predictions , as you &apos;ve read , are serious .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s going to change .
it &apos;s also my great , life-long love and fascination .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
why do they advertise for us if we can &apos;t buy ?
you have to admit that this is a great choice .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
a few years ago , i started developing littgends .
they still describe the broad lines as untouched .
my grandfather was in the prohibition in prison .
she was a weapon , strong woman , she had impact .
so , in a way , sometimes the mapping gives us the technology .
i always start with a skill , an idea .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but what is the trick that makes it look realistic ?
but what if you want to see the paintbrush ?
but my logical side didn &apos;t like it too .
i just want to say a little bit about salad resins .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . cardiac desire .
we also have led to design schools .
this is the simulation of the chesapeake bay .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to deal with injustice .
my uncle died of alcohol diseases .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
in fact , we &apos;re also a majority of those community leaders .
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
let &apos;s get the animal beginnings , it costs a lot of money .
when a neighbor helps the other , we strengthen our communities .
ohhhhh , wowwwww !
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing galvanic .
50 percent of their decisions have been made within nine minutes or less .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer .
and my talk today is primarily going away from these cognitive act .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
this is the really cool part , and it &apos;s called collections .
open the card , and they jump in with a click .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a lot about transparency .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
you could also use ordinary technologies -- technology to spread .
one of my friends did it -- richard boller .
imagine these dots could really start flying in front of the screen .
i smile , and i say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
these are the kinds of questions that we &apos;re going to have to face .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
and i can tell you , it was a transformative experience .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
and this is from an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
i mean , how much do we think of our memories ?
the more you deserve the more satisfaction you are .
that our survival is tied to the survival of every single being .
ten minutes later , the judge decided to break a judge .
right , bryan , the judge has magic .
and yeah , i have a job , as you might see .
secondly , photos should have the same lighting .
my mother , my sister and i slept at the same bed .
for example , this somebody who is completely logical .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
yes , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to get there .
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the film of statements .
and the movie is called &quot; the star conscience does . &quot;
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
only i think it &apos;s more like him , not true .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy that . thank you very much .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
i mean , we &apos;re asking ourselves , why are we fighting this ?
that &apos;s a lot of deaths from masses , 20 an hour .
so this should be better at the beginning of my death penalty .
because they &apos;re the ones who are also experts for taste .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
i mentioned the face of miguel and he was kidding .
so the paintbrush also better the system . &quot;
and then i &apos;m immediately going to notice that this is unfair .
and also , what would you think in the spirit today ?
and oil is going to be able to replace energy through other energy sources .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t do it .
like algae -- and other terrible things .
i &apos;m not going to tell you it because i want to use it .
it was totally exclusive that it could fail .
so that got me right up , and i wanted to get more .
and immediately , i see another pattern , which is inherent .
yeah , there &apos;s a little bit of it down there .
that &apos;s not the resource efficiency , but it &apos;s effective .
we &apos;ve been using holland now over three years .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird things .
i know now that it was the reason of the ocean .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
i study woman , and she was in breathtaking .
and i started collecting more and more .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 , if a bat lifts 300 .
in 2010 , we just connected two billion people online .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our perceptual system .
and the illuminating path through the rest of the book .
&quot; because she &apos;s been holding this morning , &quot; he said .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropy .
this approach , for everything that we &apos;re doing .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all sorts of recognition .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone here in this audience .
well , your life itself is not going to be happier .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re always lost .
a very concrete desire that we invent this technology .
here &apos;s a picture of an org in kentucky .
he &apos;s got a foraging from 15 to one .
i can say that the changer is a man .
we &apos;ve been in the case called the bird era age .
this is 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
this is the recovery that we finished recently .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
but you can , but if you &apos;re in a foreign way .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t seem to be more human .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about in a minute .
or want to be more powerful , more force .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though that &apos;s part of it .
my great-grandparents died all the time when they were 60 .
now , where should we go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
this is what they &apos;re all in the suburbs .
and of course , it can never be in germany . &quot;
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
and the more i talked about , the more i should tell .
and i celebrate , i &apos;m a little bit like a little kid .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit everything in my little tiny suitcase .
when you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re pulling other people happily .
these are subjects in the field of dense social networks .
how can we translate these feelings from the games into reality ?
this is how it was made out of the same , bad team of a team .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worried .
so the people in the west have really thought about creativity .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
one consequence was that the phone was never broken .
the way we can predict the structure and the function .
a few months earlier , and i had just forgotten everything .
even who kills someone is not just a murderer .
for example , the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
and this video was already at the january last january .
each of these issues , of course , are made of many , smaller decisions .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing time .
today i want to tell you about circles and openness .
they &apos;re clearly interacting with their environment and their experiences .
this trick you can run your friends and neighbors . thank you .
you know , there were no mandarin paradise in the paradise .
yes , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
one of the things that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting in terms of vision .
i apologize that i have to shrink so much .
secondly , what economists call tuna .
and i think it &apos;s worried that the world looks like this .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
so it hasn &apos;t changed , and yet it has changed everything .
we &apos;ve just released the 7-billion-dollar brand .
then let &apos;s put this analogy in the future .
so , if you could do the lights again .
it was a shop that was dragged wire .
are you so far ? you see a little nervous .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
the things that are just being used are in technical systems .
so the device you see here doesn &apos;t work .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean coal .
they did that by taking the country off the land .
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
they &apos;re frightening the fear . they &apos;re welcoming out the risk .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
there &apos;s only the second best , the fire brigade .
they can blow away , where they go and stand .
an astonishing miserable lack of nine innocent debt .
this is what i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually going to end up with a roller of an iceberg .
this is somebody who &apos;s safe in the rest of four , 10 .
we &apos;ve used to get used to things that linear things happen .
i had a 14-year-old boy , a 14-year-old boy as mandela .
they &apos;re in there , they want to get to the end of the gangs .
and then people could eat this and not be blinded .
because this is where the actual government of government work .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what do you mean ? &quot;
and then we started to negotiate with the insulin .
the conventional system sees all over the world like this .
i explained what those notes could mean .
so they &apos;re helping with questions , they &apos;re asking people for the next time .
but even our perception of how they fake us , too .
and other examples are the ambiguity , intelligent systems .
how many towers have the house where they live ?
we think it &apos;s clean -- smell and good as well .
i believe in it , and i feel like we should teach this .
and i guess many of you have done this as well .
some people were disappointed that it wasn &apos;t a poetry .
i sent them home without talking to my doctor .
the cost of solar energy last year was 50 percent .
we need to get to the machine government of the government .
there is a direct back to this .
the monkey routiness of software is usually a couple of years .
and sure enough , we can find fast food chain .
cats look at cats that look at this video .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
and what &apos;s happened is that i needed a experts .
looks pretty much like old-fashioned language .
i just wish i could see my kids growing up .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
it has moments of life , a different way of life .
and i talked about them , a expedition .
we &apos;re talking about the fluctuation of information .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineer .
this is already the first year half of his advertising .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
so they go around and install these art installations like this .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you &apos;ve got to protect it . &quot;
i was shocked . i was shocked until the inside .
i went through the emergency department on my way home .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
i say that because i believe identity is very important .
because all of these new technologies today are moving from themselves .
because your life depended on if you did the job right .
and these people know something we &apos;ve lost out of the eyes .
i knew she was coming to be giving me a fake .
today , we &apos;re not just finding something that we do with .
a typical wal-mart gives you 100,000 products today .
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you is what is truly awesome .
for example , the previous example , it was about finding details .
he said , he didn &apos;t . he &apos;ll ask him .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
if it wasn &apos;t moving , you &apos;ve dig them out .
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
again , what potential do we want to call the potential ?
i say , we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , two reasons .
when we looked at how feelings deal with income levels .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
there was no christmas trees . we did all this .
and we should not . our health care system is .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
the program i &apos;m using here is a small experiment .
look at miguel farmers , farmers like miguel .
the one on the farm is , the animals are not feeding their animals ?
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not so sure .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the photo actually was put together .
the words , as long as his friends , mockingbird now .
and we found that there was actually a context .
do you know how many decisions you make on a typical day ?
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
so the driving force behind the cybercriminals is the superpower .
i didn &apos;t strive to my wife two years .
the pilot sent the machine to the hudson river .
the revelation is , death is a part of life .
that keeps us going on and makes us continue to evolve .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
it &apos;s about 120 feet from the water , or 40 feet .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
you see the person who &apos;s wondering what &apos;s going on inside .
most of my activities , i have two hips .
it turns out that dna synthesization is very difficult .
we know that money is very important , goals is very important .
we &apos;re thinking about our future as an assumptions .
now , the memory itself is a storyteller .
what it ruined was the memories of the experience .
we &apos;re going to go to the next couple more days .
there &apos;s a one-by-one instruction there .
this is what happened . not a team had a robust structure .
a fish climb , but also a bird reserves .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love story .
the first one that was more like a passionate monkey monkey .
he &apos;s all happy about this , because he &apos;s faked it .
because music is a language , and it &apos;s a language to communicate .
and , first of all , i think , is , what is the right thing .
but i &apos;ll just make it a little bit more curious .
i started thinking , i should just interfere with that project .
we can , of course , look at the waste problem .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
if you don &apos;t do that , someone can take it away .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
just to precise points of time , they agreed .
when the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
so you can ask : how happy is living ?
most of them are completely ignored by the memory itself .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
has a single audience in the audience of someone who has masks ?
it &apos;s the question of whether you can get that to zero .
you can test it in my talk .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum of a lot of ideas .
and she asked him what &apos;s your hobbies ?
so , that , in every store , you can get things back .
so the question is , how do we deal with these windmills ?
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
so , for example , shock the environment , fewer cars .
and life lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
so if i hide them by side , they &apos;ll interest their interest .
am i looking like i just could write a song ?
she said it would be like a thumb of the air .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
you add a blue one , and you can do light .
but they don &apos;t take the most precedent .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast .
however , we &apos;re still on the galapagos islands .
more and more people would come in , because they were angry .
it was the fear of terror , the life of her life .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
we have a lot of cells that are not on themselves alone .
you make the mistake now , and you get a lot of it later .
and what &apos;s below that is what we call bureaucracy .
but where would the next aed be to help this patient ?
you have to design 62 different decisions to design your car completely .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t work that way .
almost like we were going to prepare for our lives .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my ego space .
i was the only one who could talk to the airplanes .
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
think of this as a point , as a flying point .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
this is a fascinating adventure you &apos;re going to .
this is going to change politics , i think , in the coming years .
we found that in terms of happiness on the happiness itself .
they are dark in their urine . they &apos;re almost never doing .
usually , most people start to engage themselves in the task .
you &apos;ve got to imagine the enormous challenges that you &apos;ve got to do .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
if you walk , yes , every footprint would destroy the floor .
if we push it over , we can shy a little bit back .
the most powerful mountain workers is the director of massey .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
there &apos;s a magic crowd . i don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a book .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will only be worse .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
because through marine protected areas , we basically replace the past .
i want to end with a story that really excites me .
sometimes i lose the same balance . a story for end .
i found that technology should be able to make magic and not kill .
so now we &apos;ve removed the scales of time .
so today , evolution can happen in the time of time by microseconds .
here , he lifts a rare pocket of a tar .
that is , we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
we could reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
the less i think about it , the more intuitive .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
autocolors , colors of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
they &apos;re not even coming out of the museums .
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
i really like your way , sergey .
i became the miracle part , this day , not dying .
it &apos;s called eyemen , and you can see the description .
this is the average size of a greenland iceberg .
i mean , what does anyone do with so many outfits ?
and as a general term , we can use the word for sexuality .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think we can .
we all need to be able to believe things we can &apos;t see .
let &apos;s call him miguel . in fact , he &apos;s called miguel .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to do first of all .
and then the same happens in a good , excruciating conversation .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
we take images of this mini-mini button of detectors .
economists call this a partisan improvement .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what gives us modern progress .
the way to maximize is to maximize maximizes .
we can shift from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
this is a whole book , an example of non-visual data .
and of course , we all share the same adaptation .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in the case of inotauotacre .
there are cases that are out there , like the owintact .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just from our heads .
i want to help you with a very specific aspect of curiosity .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
ceo is a little bit more about average . but here it is interesting .
because , although he &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
this is a evidence of the evidence that men are not pigs .
this deputy ran over the older black hole .
i don &apos;t know how to be recipient .
you go to the block and you take it as a revelation .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the pace of the room .
bonobos are related to our next living relatives .
the first one is a contradiction of complexity .
they &apos;re investing most of their time in construction structures .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little it &apos;s being supported .
normally , you &apos;re just danish , and some people come , not others .
now , he mentioned the minerals of phytoplankton .
i take the breathing of the audience , or unconsciously .
you feel that &apos;s the real truth behind that .
but the question i want to throw up is : why not ?
and the best part is perhaps what &apos;s supposed to be in the field of health .
this is technology supported , which is available today .
and i thought , this is going to be so hard , so painful .
wr wants to help people who were convicted of innocence .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
how did he get to look for this particular kind of help ?
let &apos;s jump back to the moma , again in new york .
tempt will be part of the show , which is quite driving .
we make androgen , and we talk about roanding genes .
and if you did it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this is scandals , and we should be ashamed .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
but as they talked to different people around the world , they have talked about this opportunities .
they have a renewable energy rate of fifteen percent today .
and they did it with something called the lead-based maps .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so , i &apos;m busy busy looking at what is natural or intuitive .
and these are just the biohacker , the individual people .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to the scientific impact .
this struck me as if i wanted to share my jeans .
he invited the king of sideways to dinner .
but somehow we &apos;re building this issue of this issue .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half-year .
but instead of crying in panic , he just stopped .
how about tears that we can &apos;t even predict ?
if you look at the people you have to do with ...
and guess what we found in the attacks of the code ?
imagine that every single person is being controlled by people .
okay , let me just give you a little bit of blood for you .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
new investments to create well-paying jobs .
six , social fall . speaker : 65 . 65 deaths .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with me and design .
that means that the players of the three out of 10 strokes .
a long time ago , there were gray whales -- 500 years ago .
in many , they &apos;re going to say , they &apos;re crazy . that &apos;s good .
the ancient interpretation of a piece of an ounce is this comparable .
from my eye view , i saw the janitors on the janitors and off .
fireflies were always in a glass box .
this picture , for example , has about 10 billion points , i think .
so i decided that when i was 15 , i was a diver .
this is a little bit bigger . let &apos;s take a look at the center .
and within a few years , lego moved into every household .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
by the way , i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer .
and i &apos;m going to show you my outfits for this week .
56 percent of the ratios are not coming from court .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely sterile .
i asked him how to become such a fish experts .
there were the nuclear research facilities .
from that time , an anecdote , which you may know .
no , no , no need to sing a little whistle or sing .
and six milliseconds , including a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s much further back to the cultures in the pre-industrial times .
so my opinion is a very boring hack .
i think it &apos;s kind of like that shit or something .
that actually has two thousand shape , which is what you have to say , these networks .
finally , a solution , which is large enough to solve our problems .
so , this looks like a basketball plaff .
and if we can do that , can we launch the chromosome ?
i wouldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t like myself .
well , in fact , the number of violent crimes didn &apos;t change very much .
i first put him in a restaurant in southern spain .
because ultimately , our humanity , depending on all our humanity .
it was always so inspiring , so refugee .
the death penalty in america is defined by wrong .
the trash would go on the side . the side would go home .
alone , this airport has a surface of 100 square miles .
i like things that are weird . i like odd things .
this is my marke in my small , distorted industry .
so maybe you should be an interview from this . &quot;
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leaders .
here &apos;s a clip out of this angrigon code .
we &apos;ve got its bed so that it can look outside .
we degrab a person who has value for our society .
we &apos;re making a games to get the suffering in the real world .
we hate to have a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
what about children &apos;s paralysis ? we take that . why not ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is , you know .
the secret is that the key to the key to these skills is .
this is indeed the true disappearance of human and machine .
a few . probably , like many creative creative people here .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
they produced the highest construction in the smallest time .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of tons on every planet .
i grew up with a cave science fiction .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building siv siv , not intensive .
so here was finally a company trying to make it right .
the component is becoming increasingly a friend of mine that you live with .
and i &apos;m not sure they really stick with me .
the interesting thing is , if i &apos;m going to make a little trip out of that .
there was , i think , a pretty good code .
in fact , nasa showed that there are many of them out there .
they &apos;re going to increase the paralysis and the sensations .
now , i wondered , how can i really get this over ?
it &apos;s an independent area . you control all the mineral minerals .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex physical world view .
someone had broken and had the fooled system .
photos like this : a farmer along a much of a road .
the biggest fear they had was raped , rape and death .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to figure out all these extensions .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange road road .
but let &apos;s see , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
i brought some seven underwear , and that &apos;s all .
but a lot of people get caught in a very strange position .
our gut is a wonderful hospitality environment for these bacteria .
now , the two species of the self-replication of happiness .
well , life itself lives its continuous life .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of happiness in happiness .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mimics .
the modern world , as we know it is almost 300 years old .
ah , the majority . that &apos;s what i like to think of as a doctor .
my inspiration comes from a event that &apos;s 2,500 years back .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
now , what does that have to do with placebo ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;re the renewables that are often called them .
this is a fish run in the western corner of spain .
so , i think , how is this kind of professional diagnosis ?
the notized notes have the function of the letters of a letter .
then , these are lasers of the pre-industrial cultures .
that is , you have navigated on sound and rhythm .
so that &apos;s just one application that you can do with that .
and then we &apos;ve worked such a codear cop .
on the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
should i be writing on this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
this is what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
54 percent of the deaths have been shrinking through drilling .
essentially , the building block had become a building block of our time .
how about a new sentence , never before .
how can a judge get into something that &apos;s not ?
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lyncha .
so , programs which are the most numerous animals .
for example , the fish had been shot on a shell flight .
the possibilities that have not been allowed would have been explicitly encouraged .
so i made a few years ago that i could do that .
after all , in advance , we should welcome the fear .
a remarkable , marble brand . what is your brand ?
why is it important to launch neutral ? what represents the red ?
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free of limits .
and i said , &quot; how are you communicating ? &quot;
well , that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
and the key indigenous indicator of this is the language of languages .
and i had to explain to the journalists that there &apos;s no test .
and this is called androgen-receptor defect .
we &apos;re going to develop collaborative , the heartbreaking creature .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to look at as a ph.d. .
right now , in the present moment , but we have an incredible opportunity .
and soon , i wrote a paper about genetically engineered food .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
so i offered a 10,000-dollar prize software for the winner .
one day , this mirror , yes , there &apos;s a beautiful one .
there was no instrument at the time than there was no piano .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
even if you were shooting now , you &apos;d have emissions .
most people know most people from the software software .
this is actually live on the internet . you can check it .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nunavv .
but nothing has been invented to me again until now .
and the best part is that they connect to magnets .
some of my favorite passions in the last five years .
i looked into the wheel , and it was a little bit embarrassed .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular tonight .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
so the dramatic numbers come down at the prisons .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about death penalty .
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkeys . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know a lot about government when i started this program .
this is my weekend . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
which corresponds to the thoughts and feelings about them ?
and if they &apos;re at risk , they can really do bad things .
and that urgency , that goal , has really changed my life .
they &apos;re talking about nature &apos;s power to tell us who we are .
if we &apos;re not going to take phosphorus and absent .
this piece of 50 year-old technology became the most magic thing for me .
but at youtube , more than 48 hours of video will be uploaded per minute .
if you could do it for me , you could also help me .
and so just disappeared all of these companies , one after the other .
i &apos;m sad that we never know each other as adults .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one of us deserves to do it .
so if we do something with the cities , this is a big deal .
and that &apos;s why , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go to the house .
if you could have one of those , it would be a very different world .
specialized skills and processing skills and combining combination of their success .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
and somehow we need to bring change to zero seniors .
we &apos;re still finding other strands of what their rights are .
that &apos;s the space of most perception that we have .
this is our youngest taster at the bottom right there .
by the end of march , the lhc will be again .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
do you know how to call a 3,000-mile league ?
i think that , in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
if someone lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
and so i believe that the ted community should be a horse .
and she &apos;s committed , organic , of course .
my friends from honduras asked me to say , thank you ted .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
now , finally , the film has a very big touch .
this is actually just a period of two to two weeks ago .
these people will be connected to the film in eternity -- forever .
so all these green areas , these are the richest environments .
one is called jazz , and the other is called &quot; snot . &quot;
so unfortunately , we have a piece of god that &apos;s a virtual play .
i went to the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelm .
in the short time here , i realized one : ted has a identity .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good piece of intuition to actually do experiments .
in my opinion , incarceration changed our world .
this is all reality today , and in the future , will be much more possible .
so it allows the interaction to grow from binary , trust and with each other .
here &apos;s what it says , the more you need to do , the better .
people said , are you not afraid to succeed ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding to me , but i can live with it .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely uncheerable .
i love this one : &quot; watson shots on human enemy . &quot;
i looked at her and i smiles , but she looked very serious .
three months later , i moved on and left the adventure .
it &apos;s about creating livestock of abundance .
i like a lot of black colors , lots of gray things and such a stuff .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impulse for the flyout .
and the question was : how could you create technology , new technology ?
for example , i don &apos;t want to give you the same rights as a human .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
and this is something that we need to learn to do , which is very quick .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s concerts .
the person &apos;s supposed to be out of the monkeys or a common ancestor .
and loud signs , and b , etc . , etc .
how were his living environment , like the society and politics ?
on september 10 , last year , the machine went down to the first time .
we &apos;ve got little-glutted kids and they &apos;re distributing to play with them .
and when i heard her , she made a chuck sound .
and i was good , i ended up with cschlaude .
but if i ask you , what &apos;s the way you do with your wife ?
you collect information about the play in the secondary literature .
meanwhile , there &apos;s a lot of people working with it , and they can all engage .
but what if the image you &apos;re connected to all of your images ?
you say you &apos;re not dying by the names that you &apos;re dying .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other regional technology .
because the categories tell me how i can keep them apart .
so i sat down , and you played the tedtalk .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
we should be able to eradicate everything we want .
and i tend to think of myself as a shadow of my shadow .
and then studies have been conducted in order to see if that was right .
you see , there &apos;s some enormous possibilities there .
the natural comes from asia , in which all japan comes from japan .
because a good engineer has either his great cars or nuclear power plants .
this was the very first beginning of a musical expression .
you can only have numerous missions if they &apos;re not there .
it &apos;s going to be good . the question is , how is it going to get us ?
they didn &apos;t buy their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
the official belief from all western industrialized societies .
&quot; do you remember the patient that you went home ? &quot;
we live on a planet that is 70 percent covered in water .
just dip it out of the apartments against the cities .
namely , that you can just use these logic .
often the music class is so much that you &apos;re learning the notes .

you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change your cells ?
this also represents the entertainment value of this talk , so i hope i &apos;ve got a lot of you .
but in fact , my research at the institute for the future is exactly the opposite .
nothing comes out in my sleeve or comes out , not a trickster , and you can look at everything .
and that &apos;s because these fantasy that made me crazy at all were not fanatics .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of a column , often as a &quot; walking wave &quot; .

now , if i had ever opened the order with the 600 pictures of it , i would have spent another hour .
people get into their faith , and so that &apos;s because you can &apos;t free them .

here we see this again , again , again , the el here , again , all of us , all aggregated .
overview : now , i &apos;m sort of interacting with the object , can zoom out again , zoom in .

because quite often people , they can &apos;t use it to be used , so everybody can deal with it .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of a mixture of rabbits and boggers .

but the ocean , a real ocean , i got only two years later , when we moved to california .
so for the learning process of music at least as long as the spoken word language .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put together these little pieces and make the mistakes correctly .
we &apos;ve made it into about a hundred genes , or something like this .
and this really reaches these ideas , these restrictions for the space on the screen .
and it &apos;s humble to think that perhaps our species have been around for 600,000 years .
because in this context , we &apos;re only beginning to grasp the amazing things that make us out .
we &apos;ve developed an app for ylam , expanded reality to find these aeds .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , by telling me one of the kings that works on the side of the skull .
we use this great euphemism , and try to figure out what &apos;s going on as meaningless .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning .
so if you want to optimize the two species of the maximize , you want to end up doing very different things .

the founding fathers were from my point of view of the original atomic activist , so that &apos;s why .
they played a toy game , and they were able to break the seven-hour adventures .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billion people , are the success of scientific method .
that would have been without the environmental demands , but the power is still so much more important .
certainly i would never get an alien world with a spaceship , which seemed quite unlikely .
this is not going to give me any spontaneous , but this is what &apos;s going to happen , and this is what &apos;s happening right now .
all right , just to conclude , i want to see that i talked a lot about the fathers .
you know , if the movie comes out , we might look like a hormone volumes .
what are we going to do with the fact that we &apos;re just going to tell you about a few zeroes ?
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then increase my strength and take it off .
but if you &apos;re in an episode , and you &apos;re told , &quot; let &apos;s go from oil . &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we could never have known since we had a marker of human potential .
and that &apos;s going to get worse , and pretty soon , children are going to die because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
in the rich world , the millions of us have been threatened by one generation , barely .
here &apos;s a very fundamental service . is there any way to read at home so that you can read the homework ?
the greeks called these god-scraped minds of the minds of the creativity of moons .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch them go into the next century .
and what we &apos;re doing is actually installing a evolutionary process in which microphones go down .
so in other words , the future is every year around a year since i &apos;ve been shrinking this world .
they shoot the decision -- they shoot on their own , even if they &apos;re interested in their own self-interest .
so doing things -- you know , people reminds -- this is kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
if you surround yourself with the right people , you won &apos;t just understand it , you &apos;re going to appreciate it .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said they had this model exactly .
one of the ways that &apos;s particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve used in the last time , is evolution itself .
we had a team of rocks in boston in the boston program for program programs .
so , imagine you were at the same time in a number of places , what would that feel like ?
obviously , it &apos;s a very simple virus . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
so the neurons are the information processing portion , these cell communities have built up .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital head out of the torroid into connection .
china eaca , a small antioxidants to help them jump on the jumps .
no , the gap that i &apos;m talking about has to do with the fact that they &apos;re disappointing themselves .
if professors are curious , they &apos;re often sighted down into such research .
this is the machine age of machine age , and this is what &apos;s happened , and this is the photo grace .
and it &apos;s about solving a playful , creative , original , a problem .
and we think that we &apos;re going to be the first generation of the vibrating generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .

at the moment , it was like a movie director would have landed a shift in change .
this is what if i were to say , shaking your child , it &apos;s only three times five times .

his cause , the piece of writing , will always be more and more too personal to play with me .
but this concepts of cyber age , which will bring these possibilities back to our ability again .
so that naked assessing for them to survive , and they multiply in size .
so this is how simple these words that we use in the language of the political correct again .
the first example requires what many of you know , and some of you appreciate , very few of you don &apos;t need at all .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor says , &quot; we could do a or we could do b .
i &apos;d like to share with you this mechanism today , or explain something that &apos;s unfamiliar with you .
so now i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite pictures , of the stephen brevity of the uge .
but now , here &apos;s the evidence : if you have to take a evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
for example , in bach , the trash of trash is twenty percent of the trash between windmill .
but again and again , very rare , something special happened . one of the things that was actually obese .
my heart , i was scrambling , as i tried to imagine what was going on .
the human part of this book , the end , is , of course , the thing we &apos;re most interested in .
immediately , they &apos;re going to be one for the those of you who are predictable , you can &apos;t prove that .
they have reformed the demographic of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that is changed at a moment a lot of biology .
and because you &apos;re obsessed , are you taken from the spirit , how can you be harmed ?
for these non-engineers , litted littes were another material , electronics was just another material .
so what can three-billion growing , healthy , healthy , educated , productive members of the human community ?
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is indiscriminate , but also very tired .
and every time it divided , it turns out that the chemicals have gone into a lot of chemicals .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a realistic outcome .
so i wanted to create something else that starts when the process gets trigger .
and when you take a picture and you end up with a camera that ends up in the process .
yet my interest in photography when i first received my first digital camera in the age of 15 years .
the rotor is this moving part of the centrifuge , this black object that you see .

but not just that -- that &apos;s how melting and connecting it with the universe and other devices out there .
three billion hours a week , not nearly enough , to solve the most urgent of the world &apos;s problems .
there are so controls things like this all the genetic engineering plants on the sticks .
if any of you had built a 5,000-inch construction , he would have contributed the price at home .
i met mr ain 2008 , two years ago , two years ago , the walt disney hall .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far you can take a piece of future away .
every year we &apos;re losing three million tons of phosphorus that really had to go back to circles .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated as if i &apos;m going to go into the gang .
you can go out and create your own museum -- out of all of those images , you can put your own collection on .
so , in great and all of us , we &apos;re very confident that we actually determined what the goal is .

because the ground is going to die the moose , and the wind will die and the water will wash off the ground .
so that you &apos;re going to be able to remove citizens with these scientific technologies .

when we looked at it as a warmth , the light turned out , and the box looked , we saw that the metal piece was always in a piece .
the founding fathers came back and put them back through a new nuclear concept , and this concept said that all humans were created equally .
there &apos;s a scholar , who &apos;s called wolf , and he &apos;s going to tell him , sometimes wolf , he says , there &apos;s no liberty .
that means that local village has actually become a global village , with the same principles , of course , profoundly intuitive , but the total transparency .
the reason that i was worse , i felt bad about all these available possibilities , my expectations for what a good jeans went up , up .
i sent out a couple of facebook news , some twitter news stories , and i gave people the opportunity to give my tedtalk at ted2011 .
and maybe we do it , wield as a natural thing , a natural thing , a useful and useful thing to see , and we don &apos;t feel represented by their presence .
i &apos;m saying that i &apos;m sleeping my wrist to make sure nothing disappeared in my sleeve or out , and that &apos;s a lie .
because we &apos;ve done all of this with only 10 to 12 people who &apos;ve been working for years , and sometimes we &apos;ve been back to 2 months .
and now you can just , if you want to do anything , if you want to test yourself anything , and most of all , if you want to make people happy , that courage to lie .
do you remember , as carl sagan , the voyager-spaceship vehicle , when it was pulled back to saturn , it turned out to be in the world ?
and then my friends who are doing little proust movies , &quot; well , how are we going to do with these big , giant hollywood competitors ? &quot;
what they found was an anatomic concept , and they put it through another radical , and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
and it &apos;s a lust , when you see it in italy , like the people in the bow , they &apos;re eating coke &apos;s car out of the car , they &apos;re cheating .
a country has already offered its farming courses to shore , as a dish for the occupation of the local courtship system .
and i was amazed to be resistant to resistance , to what is the most effective measure of health care in human history .
i spend most of my time with the sobering weakest in the social settlements and places where there &apos;s a lot of hoping to be .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project , where almost every agency we talked to , its customer has its recommended to leave the fingers .
they nivellisted the field , and they decided that anatomically , the common ground , was not the differences , and that was very radical .
and at the end of the day , we really want to face a choice , and we want to live in a monomatic world of the monkey world , or in a spelling polymer world ?
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal quantum mechanics , we would have to send all of the vocabularies out .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , that &apos;s the highest , not to be there ?
we &apos;ve digitized almost 20 years . as we sequenced the human genome , we &apos;ve moved from the changes of analog in the world to digital computers .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of p.m. if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of your thumb is one of them .
so in order to buy new jeans after many years of the trains of the old age , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple of jeans here . &quot;
to give you a sense of this sensation , of course , i had to think about something remarkable about this remarkable worker of doun and voois , no one of the black magic .
and because nothing is more important than our survival , the first half of all of the information that is part of our templates , the amydala .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i got most of the feedback , or where i had the greatest success , where i was interacting with things directly .
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend a lot of time trying to imagine , because , if you &apos;re going to imagine all the time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
you have to have two things clear : one of the medical professionals to be amputated , and the other social opinion is whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
the basic idea of this company was to jump the analogies with optical prints , and start jumping with digital production .
and you don &apos;t have to -- when the attacks -- you don &apos;t have to take the data over a usb -- like we saw it in pets .
and , in a way , this time , the critical variability , which is a reminder of self , has a self of myself , has very little impact on this story .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life and when they do that , people are also making mistakes time .
and it will enable people to measure their home from their blood pressure , to send him to their physician and to other parts for something more than 100 dollars .
so the first case : all the atomic nuclei from that are made out of all of the metal , and at the same time , the same atoms are moving out of atoms and up .
when i think about creating the flow , i &apos;m not going to live a luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about making a life of possibilities .
but recently , dna evidence shows that the etresome , later the roometed tubes were embedded with the same dna as the old didacity .
like happiness , you can go very differently , depending on how you think and think about the memory itself , or even if you think about the life itself .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of it as a mammals -- they &apos;re buried without all the complex qualities .
we &apos;re going to turn it on , and we expect it to be on the first data in june or juli , and we can use our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
we want to create the world &apos;s inventors , the inventors , the efforts , because this world we live in , these interactive , these interactive world .
imagine this device . right in a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease and 1.3 percent of the staff of the health care system .
so one day i decided to go to the liter liter , and i asked the leader , &quot; this model that you &apos;re going to offer people all these choices ? &quot;
the head of congress came up on the stage and said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but we might look at the tedtalk .
we need to take that conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the time machine and go into the future , we &apos;re going to be happy to have that .
so there i was again with a little team on unknown terrain , and we were like , &quot; avatar , &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
and then we didn &apos;t really feel like that , but that &apos;s what i think has already been pretty good , the people are right there .
i mean , it might sound odd to think about that a thing at the same time is two different places , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea , they developed .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; -- to a ta-landa moment . &quot;
but the latest measurements are beautiful , and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re still not able to do that .
i was seventh 10 , when i went back to one of his classes again , and i played the last one of the four balconies of chopin , one of them in a late .
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t have to look at everything for you buried . everyone knew you had this physical test , that was your test .
at nine people that we &apos;ve executed , one that we &apos;ve taken for an innocent school , which has been released and out of the death cell .
so an organism could learn to learn , for example , can &apos;t eat a particular one , because they got bad , and they got sick , the last time he eaten it .
personally , i &apos;m thinking that it &apos;s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to go to compromise with the ideas in your head .
it &apos;s about how to engage people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and use them to make them a peaceful experience .
finally , this elderly black man came up with a very troublemaker in the courses , and i sat right down to almost the defense of defense .
there &apos;s this airplane in hundreds of thousands of little themes that are working together to make their safer flight . don &apos;t do that more reliable ?
one day -- this is a actual report -- this came in : &quot; poppy shell in my trash . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult wanted me to meet me , relatives , she turned into a box aisles , and became my hands .
we &apos;re going to have a process that , in the rule , possibly 100,000 years , and we can do it in a thousand years , and maybe even on the next 100 years .
there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-oh &quot; uh-oh moments than others , and under the worst swells , they &apos;re the most fresh cry .
so this is what we &apos;re seeing , first of all , to see , before we see it , again , back in the back of our ocean , to say , okay .
his job is to create the conditions that are less than a billionth of the universe -- and to 600 million times a second .
but also , they also have a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to more of challenges , through larger creativity and prescription cooperation .
and many discussions that i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had in the last three years to photovoltaic journal .
a season , if you have the power with water , the pressure enough , so i think it &apos;s four to six and a half thousand .
and something interesting happened . what happened to me on jacques cousteau shows , the idea was that an entirely unknown world on our own earth .
and our european network is basically just around the louder rotating of big power plants , where the wave is always changing all over europe .
one process , which is -- as everyone knows , it &apos;s tried to make something , so in other words , in fact , everybody here -- is not always rational .
and every year we ask the students to create businesses , to create products and services , to create services that can live in a decade of mild largely of the lives of people .
i came to ted , because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far apart , but it &apos;s the justice of justice .
and finally , saturday : a unique , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world about a word without saying a word .
they didn &apos;t count because he was a memory of a reminder ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had to keep in mind .
i think that the molecular biology in general , so generally , is generally speaking , biotechnology , anything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
how would it be to create the oppressed wherever they are , to give a voice to pay attention to change and create change , for the first time , for the first time ?
i love to find an opportunity to find a different colorful , insane outfit , and in the last time too , to photographs and blogger .
i told my wife , always when a human being in a moral judgment should be using this because we should try to replace it through the literal .
and it turns out that when you do it , there &apos;s something that feels a bit more concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool , so you get people to save more .
so we &apos;re not only responsible for people that we love to preserve saltary , but they &apos;re also interested in getting very good for it .
so we take something very complicated , we convert it into sound to produce a sequence of notes , and we make something very complicated in the other minds of the other .
no , it looks a lot better if we show that we &apos;re all over there , the dangers , the only thing they do when they get to fire .
now in egypt , in egypt , the records of the april of april 2011 , the main headquarters of the egypt , and they found a lot of action .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of programming work , zero parties , went through parties , tony steam , for the first time , seven years .
so that &apos;s what this reactor was a problem that we &apos;re going to fill in and that &apos;s going to reduce the volume while this process is reduced .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point of view : we have digitized the biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into new biology , by designing new life .
but this is what keeps me off at night -- one of the things that stopped at night , and we &apos;ve never really needed as much progress as we do now , never .
loud burst was the premiere prime in january , and since then -- and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing -- there were 900 million ruins of this film .
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate right now , in terms of cohm plants , because we don &apos;t have any host or ggage , because that &apos;s not going to go .
many of our friends thought we were pretty stupid to do that , and we were coming back to cheese and all the pictures of the graffiti were to the graffiti .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst errors only happened in the first five years , which is my colleagues , but total nonsense .
but these apps are like little digital memories , that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers who are paying government and performance .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very exclusive society at least exclusive time .
in a country that has just been a heart-on crisis behind the crisis , where congress has changed this conversion of being 124 / 7 .
it seems like we &apos;re right off from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually most of the time , the fundamental mechanisms are pretty much our cells pretty much the same .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this , as if the first sentence had to be wrong , as a proposal , of course , without proof evidence .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , which is , for a long time , i &apos;ve been working on trying to see how new it is .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up to my talk , and he said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply troubled , you &apos;ll hear that way . &quot;
now , there &apos;s bureaucracy and remarkable brands , these things that come out and go , but one , eighteous thing is a pretty strong thing .
and if you &apos;ve already got that the drugs of the dropper complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the data is a science for itself .
if i tell you that somebody is living on a scale of 10 times , they have lots of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self .
now , i had a couple of people in the company , and nobody could give me an answer , until i finally got to the bee of the biologists with the biologists .
basically , you get any round on every sighted letter , and while you try to educate words , these are going to be a dictionary book .
let &apos;s go back to my world of transferring medicine , where i feel a lot more comfortable or maybe a little less comfortable with them .
but then another very interesting step happened in which things started completely different , and these cells started to communicate , and information came out so that cells came from cells .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , we say , in the climate .
she starts out on the horizon , a million miles away , and everything you see are tired of tide and these poems , these poems , march .
we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these design components are the future .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous faith in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to provide us the big challenges of our planet .
so an app that is written in a few days , and then spreading from selfish , is a kind of shame in the government .
what that means is that if you hit someone , and you would say , oh , his father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about his size ?
at this point and when you laugh , you know how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience something that is very good for us to share .
how it would feel to live in a world where the german state of people would have left , especially if unproportion were many jews .
and because the government finally draws us off -- remember , &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- how is it going to affect how this change happens .
are they reliable , stable , stable family , secure , safe , safe , sacred , sacrifice and how the dalai lama is there ?
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard of , the most powerful psychoactive psychotic from the repertoire of the amundant .
and a lot of times , i &apos;ve been working with sexual people , their gender atdrew -- so people who are not the average male or females .
that &apos;s what we had to do at the time . when we put children into a book , we took the description of the trial , and we put them on the canvas in our minds .
we came up with music . and a few days later , i got an email that was standing in the nathaniel for education in me .
and that &apos;s where we &apos;re going to be at the media campus , for example , for example , the virtual reality in our v.r.s. lab , where we can actually do this all the time .
i said , &quot; listen , listen , you know , and i don &apos;t know if this book &apos;s not brilliant , it &apos;s completely my fault , right ?
because it makes a lot of sense like everything else that i &apos;ve heard about when it comes to explaining the absolutely crazy amount of creative process .
so it &apos;s soybean . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest science experiment that &apos;s ever been done -- 27 kilometers in the diameter .
and i &apos;ve argued that we might be able to create a new form of cambrian explosion in the massive scale based on this digital design .
the reason that &apos;s been better than anything was worse than anything , than anything bad was , it was possible to make people feel uncomfortable .
and i was negotiating with myself that if i could double my efforts to become the perfection and never again a mistakes that the voice could cheat .
so these are just a couple of clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but they can also be the last six days or the last six years .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i was planning for several months to do it , to find the different places for the pieces .
but also , because it turns out that we use all this time to actually change the way we &apos;re able to change what we &apos;re human beings .
i can tell you today the sound that the bach has put on the modern wing to the sound , what a baroo emboo can &apos;t do .
already in english language to translate into english , more knowledge can be lifted if you take it off , or you can go to poetry .
bg : now we need one of these scalable electricity generates , things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then go to 20 years .
when you play games , you see some nuances here , looking up at the summit , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the surprise is surprise .
you &apos;ve got to imagine , if you &apos;re doing something of the classic tracks , five hours and a new kind of natural software .
i &apos;m a canvas . in order to work out , i have to stand up every day for the same day , and i swept down , and really quite awkward .
so they found , loud herus , the worms , and the game agreed , a national strategy . one day you would eat next day .
the other note says whether we &apos;re using nuclear technology , whether it &apos;s developed in all the developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
the film , i sold this as &quot; romeo , &quot; and julia ship on a ship ship . &quot; it became an episode of episode , a passionate film .
so far , in discussions , this insulin is trying to do the things that targeted , that have a very own web network that has to do with our connected and nothing to do .
and so we decided to build ourselves in berlin into a hall where we could sort of build the electric power of the island at a very precisely three .
this means that the interpret has to translate this mess of the emergency emergency room into a different listening , concrete , verbal language .
and the intuitive user is not only an apple appointer factor , more elementary achievement , if i want to make technological devices to make people usable .
a lot of journalists called me on the question , &quot; what are you going to do , are we going to tell us whether we &apos;re going to have a primordial or female ? &quot;
now , what i hear is that a lot of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monkey culture , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing that &apos;s wrong .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and to get them to play a game in some way , to control their health .
and imagine , i &apos;ve even considered five year-old children with p.m. so that &apos;s how to stop these practice , without natural success .
bg : well , the actual spending of research -- let &apos;s say we should spend 10 billion more per year than you do today -- that &apos;s not that dramatically .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore and interact , and the unexpected novelty that we &apos;re creating is the real estate of creativity .
and there &apos;s neither video games nor this superfluid that had to do with computer movies all of the language in the media landscape that i had to create pictures in my head .
as you know , in the village , who knows what happened to the winners , and when this is happening over the extension of our own self through these mobile devices .
maybe i wanted to be so successful , and be able to take responsibility , so i could be able to power my patients without having to contact him .
i got a fine ticket , because i &apos;m not on my side of my bike , but there &apos;s often a disability not to drive on the bike .
and so i see one of the people in common with most other experimental quantum physicists who need a good logic to put complex ideas together .
if we look at one of the founders of the modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his book , &quot; i have a kind of solution . &quot;
jacques cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating shows that the animals and places around us and a world that we had never imagined before .
and if we succeed , of course , it will be for us of course , for nike , for power and mauritz and all the textile textile industry .
in every step , we produced these pieces in the translator so we could sequence them because we tried to create a very robust process of creating what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
in other words , when the entry entertainment of the 20th century is the participation of the community , our part of the phenomenon is to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading or making something new .
my wife , my kids and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and they were rubbling , and they had taken away our house .
we can go out and look at the data , and then look at the data , and see that circulation and cancer are the usual suspicion , but not for everyone .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the tuna , the length , the sales , the fish , are collapsed .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has doubled more than doubled on the higher income of the world &apos;s population has tripled .
one of the areas we see in which we see in our culture , today in the united states , are the united states fighting over the beginning of life .
now , this is good to see that paul &apos;s running around and talking about vaccines , and how valuable they are , and that people should just stop doing jamie .
the second one is that there &apos;s a conversion of experience and memory , which is basically between being happy and being happy and happy about his life or with his life .
you go up in these capsulfur , you put them in this dark , hostile environment where there &apos;s no hope for saving if you don &apos;t make it back .
so , you can also realize that there &apos;s a change out there , and it &apos;s only by this posture , yes , the idea 100 percent renewable renewable renewable .
it was recognized in the cell , and it recognized the other chromosome as a material of digestion material , and so we ended up with a cell and a new chromosome .
and these scientists just took the different topics of documenting these ceo busy , and how much they spent making decisions that related to the topics .
all the thinking , &quot; titanic , &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and would have gone to my somewhere on a wednesday beach .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and you should also do it , because this love story , as well as romantic as romantic as it is .
my first memories of this boat -- the steady tower of the engine , the clapping of every bug , the bug and the empty horizon .
and if you manipulate the speed of that roast , you &apos;re actually able to rotate the rotor rotor , and eventually explode the centrifuge .
it &apos;s the living self that breaks the doctor -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; is it going to hurt when i put them here ? &quot;
now , when we go further and look for age , we say 40 years or younger , we see that even the crashing thing is to worry about the people .
we should call them what it is , a geeky crafts , a geeky , an ecological capital that allows them to take that production .
we &apos;re going to be able to look at whether we &apos;re going to be able to use carbon dioxide that could be used to drive this fuel in order to drive this process .
so when i started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
if people take that fund , i mean , it seems to be all the things that we believe , for example , in terms of politics and so on .
it depends on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sections , and that &apos;s how the opposite of the first sentence is , and it &apos;s proven to do it .
but in the mid- &apos; 90s , we realized that we were at the crew of the regenerative and design -- what we actually started to do is to start slowly .
it looks something like this , who doesn &apos;t have a randomness , can &apos;t have his actions for his actions and key responsibility to become responsibility , and so he &apos;s unable to calculate .
so i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and so my palette will still have more numerous nuances of color , sensitive emotions , and as today .
they also have in such an artistic aspect of biological materials , and yes , electronics also combine , and combined it in a pretty way .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the ocean , is so rich in the realm of the fascinating life that we can &apos;t really imagine .
and then the scope of the semantic connection , and the feet that really drives itself is enormous , and it &apos;s a classic network .
i recently made a survey with over 2,000 american people , and the average number of choices that were made of anxiety , which is a typical american typical day at a day .
a few weeks later , the lighting fires gave a letter to the householder , where they were for the take-home use use of their house .
the food that &apos;s been founded by a chef , or a chef of chef , has to be eaten and not just get dived or dipped .
they should be depositing these innovations , and they would be smiled by the ridiculous funeral , for those innovative approaches .
and if you want to go over 20 , three percent renewal renewables , so energy a year , not the performance at the moment , you have to switch off the el .
and then we went out to a pav.d. burning of burning , burning the burn rings , and then trying to focus on this camera .
of course , the chance for randomness is that they &apos;re very small , so they &apos;re not going to have any instructions that actually do this .
that means that instead of remind us individually , we have a standard , very common sense , in corresponding patterns of memories that we can confront our personal memories .
and yet , burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , which is the remarkable vacuum cleaner technology that you see here , everything .
so i sent them home , i made a voice into my voice , trying to say , &quot; goldman , no idea . that doesn &apos;t . &quot;
what do you think the average power for a karologists or a nurse or a nurse or a orthopedic , the birthday , should be a rescue ?
this is a people that doesn &apos;t distinguish cognitive colors between the colors and the green colors , because the celestial forest is dependent on the forest that people depend on .
and my love to science fiction appeared in my surround environment , because back in the late &apos; 60s , we went to the moon and found the deep sea .
we see many , many gigabytes of digital digital digital photographs that you can get away from , while continuing to remove , in a way , new way .
this tribe , who have the codes , 17 varian ahuasca , who all of you in the distance in the forest , are recognizing our eyes as a species .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , is to present your product as many people as possible , as many people can see .
and in this community , you can see that the most important thing is that you have to tell each other , because you have a problem , you can explain the other knee .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have traveled to this earth , to realize that they &apos;re not removed at all .
that our system also has a price rise , is that we &apos;re still having twenty percent passing , and we &apos;re also doing a pricing on the other things .
we &apos;ve only used it for two years , and now it &apos;s been used by the phosphorus mining horus globally much more in the environment than in all atoms .
we projected that in 10 years , the recognition of the civic recognition will be as high as possible , as before the forensic legal rule of law .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up with the internet and knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things that you need to build just the systems right .
and so far the isolation goes when we &apos;re going to have a species of distinguishes planets , there will be isolation and changes of the environment that could produce natural evolution in a natural way .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science . but now i &apos;m going to think you &apos;re going to have to be a director , also , a leader like a ship captain or something .
and after a very short period of time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species , and it completely turned out to be a new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
well , i hope that you agree with me , that human resources are human resources that we can use in real life , and that games have a huge meaning for change .
now , all of these random elected officials are out of leadership , all of programs , and selects , and the ones that gave me the next one . &quot;
these are two very different units , the life-forming self , and the memory itself , and the two is part of the breakthrough part of the terms of happiness .
if this device is a pure -- or a dna sequence , which is not known , it &apos;s called the rudder healthcare , and it &apos;s a pandemic , it &apos;s a pandemic .
now , when you calculated it , the people who had more than six times a glass , they had six choices , when they had a choice , they had 24 choices .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at a point when there was a pause , octavio , said , &quot; paul , we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
but for over two weeks , we have programmed , we went to the beach commercial , my children were brought in , my dog , and we also created this .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the old greek historian historian herodor , you may know this story . the story about how games were invented and why games were invented .
but i think , in this framework , and with the intent , i &apos;m going to make something bad , i &apos;m going to just leave the needle there and go from the stage .

i mean , when i &apos;m in the elevator alone , i do all kinds of weird stuff , but then i listen to other people , and i listen to all these things because i don &apos;t want to make them open , or frankly , they disappear .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to abuse less and less , but in the average , that number will rise up every year , and therefore doubling more than double than the number of services that are provided per person .
i met these people of grass , graffiti and research , and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on any surface , and then put them on a laser pointer , which is just to register the area .
so what that means is , if we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place of people in evolution , and how we look at the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
so , there &apos;s huge challenges here . there &apos;s challenges in translation . for example , if we say that the energy source is outside the country , they don &apos;t just need to deal with the technology , they need to deal with the risk of energy coming from where energy comes from .
but , as we think , the only way in biology so that there is another huge impact on food costs , or restriction of their availability is going to have access when we see carbon footprint , and therefore we &apos;re going to go to these cells .
i started working with this scientific literature on how this centrifuge is built in natasha and found that they are structured in so-called kakaskage , and every kaskage has 164 curriculum .
now the fascinating thing is that the tadine pooline , the anlie contained in the old , the inhibitors of the kind , the kind of god , is necessary to question the balls . so they ask themselves .
this is a problem , because the warming blows the frozen reason around the arctic ocean , where there are large amounts of carbon that can be stored if they look from microbes to microbes .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of the target of the attack was actually to have slow down and unfinished , obviously -- in the attempt to let engineers desperately desperate , so they wouldn &apos;t be able to get behind it .
so maybe german holds this technological change , because the more it has always been a different truth , which is that every person of the society has something special , and there can be very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt is our biggest plus size .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that &apos;s going to become the information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and the price of performance is doubling every 12 to 24 months .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as an international group of international group is that we have become aware of ourselves , we have now become real scenes , and we are online , and we know the people who are so there and so forth .

what if we could flip this situation and put it on the internet so that instead of going from one of the other to many things , many things can go there , and see patterns that would have remained linked bored to itself ?
this is what we feel guilty of the world that we say . there is no bio-land , no bioluminescent , no progression , and as they all allow that our own creatures go back to our exact .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i found something very fundamental : most of the existence in livelihood of organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information being led to both cell and death .
this was worth it for me for all of this year in the clean room , because they tested it , the scale of the massless difference between one and the metal line is about as much as the difference between the metal and the metal and the difference .
and i went to six-and-a-half &#91; unclear &#93; , and then we have friends with friends , and i &apos;ve become the founder of the solar company , which then comes along with the spades of a cell manufacturer in the world .
at the time , it was just like a monkey , where aerial , ercus and other people have said , &quot; you &apos;re actually trying to read the people if they want to read the people , then they &apos;re going to talk about that afternoon and that &apos;s completely fine .
when a person who &apos;s doing something horrible in spain , something magician has done , allah , laolle , allah , lah , brah , well brown , infraud , there &apos;s a flip view of god .
so what &apos;s going on in &quot; the explorer &apos;s specimen , &quot; is that everything from the bottom up to the bottom , from the very end , from the margins -- is sponsorted by the movies , you &apos;ll see in the movie , is the brand marx .
and the message is now , we have to end on these rotating animals , if we are able to reduce our targets , 20 percent 20 percent , 20 percent , three , three , three , three percent , and so on , if we want to get to .
they then have over a three-monthly long period of time with a &quot; strong note , &quot; which was very good . &quot; they told them that they were very smart , and they &apos;d written after these three months . they really had written .

and i &apos;m asking myself , today , how much of his vision of me as a startling power , and i &apos;ve shaped my girls &apos; image , and i &apos;ve been able to imagine myself so much as a nature of starvation , and sticks , to look at powerful human being .
and they &apos;re also being called by my doctor &apos;s office , so that he can see where my weight problem is , and it &apos;s not just in the moment i need cardiac support or , but also with a view in the past .

it &apos;s a picture of the first scarce particles that put all the way back to the lhc , and then recommended part of the lhc to make a distortion of participant in the detector .
he brought his 400,000 people , because he insisted that red buttons , and also sweetness are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can live on aids from aids .
and finally , i think , even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so on , we &apos;re not going to be measured by our technology , not by the things that we &apos;re not developing our intellect , and our intellect .
what i do instead , and what the designers do is , we think , in some abstract abstract abstract sense , that this machine , and that makes the power of our skills far better , far better than we could ever do .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world , students with develops , and architects , even with ctos , 50-plus companies , and there &apos;s something about this task , which allows deep insights to work in nature , and i &apos;d like to share with you some of them .
and since you can see that you can think of our seven senses , most of us have just five , now even though it occurred to seven , there are certainly in the near future , in the next to sense , to go back and expand to expand to expand to expand to our own self .
what you have to do there is , maybe just maybe , but that &apos;s not what you have to do . you &apos;ve got to burn all the co2 that comes out of the bureaucrats , you get in , you get out of the stone , and then you hope it &apos;s there .
and like a miracle , he took his violin off , and started looking for some exposure of incarcerts , and then asked me back to the end of the dolphins , son , scoikovi , bolicorus .
and i committed to the place , and to his brother and his father -- with the words , &quot; well , my proposal , tony , is going to talk to him , we &apos;ll find a device and we &apos;ll find a way to make his work again .
now , i have to say , when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex , sex , sex , death , sex -- it seemed pretty rational to be at the time , but at every year it &apos;s gone to the second time .
i studied historian historian , and in this case , i studied people like anatomy -- human body , animal bodies -- like bodies of liquid bodies , with liquid bodies , with bodies ; they thought about bodies .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the minister of health , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to take on the evidence of my mammography , &quot; or some cancer-by-quest to treat his patients with his patients .
so now , when i do this , the profilters of the scene go to the scene , they go out there , they collect some hacking samples , and then they turn that method , and they say , okay , this hair belongs to this hairar , so people .
he contains the dog and improved an iranian r , took the skeleton of the dog , and he made a startling dog , and he got over to the sheets of ice sheets with the thylacines .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- is because it grew up in genesis , or sijoined twins , it &apos;s interrogated by sexual surgeons , who are often adapted to norm , is not because this is the physical advantage of their body .

so i also wrote an article about it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought , &quot; frankened , &quot; why they believed that molecules were going to have a certain kind of random species , rather than a kind of random attribute to nature .
then the next thing that came out with &quot; nem neural model , &quot; or the mental model of how the software would have been working , &quot; one of the metaphor , the metaphor of a metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop computer .
the spirit can be broken down by the large water , responding to the rhythm of the rhythm , to overcome the soul of the survivors , so that the shareholders can hit such a short moment to god .

we took a ps3-camera , we built it out , put it on a led-light light light , and now we &apos;ve got a free device -- you can build it yourself , let &apos;s put it on the code , you can download the software that you can download .
we &apos;re looking into this web , and we &apos;re going to see the fifth grade , and if it &apos;s a nine-by-nine compound , we &apos;re going to take a couple of lbs , we &apos;re going to go back up again , we &apos;re going to get a little steer , we &apos;re going to come back up .

there are evidence that the neanderthals have been around 60,000 years ago , and people with severe body injuries , and perhaps the life expectancy , because the survival of these people was valuable for society .
now we &apos;ve got three-legislation laws , which are people behind bars , for a bike bike , for a bike , for the stakeholders , for the loaf of good steel , rather than making them available to the sacrifices .
the idea is , again , imagine what we &apos;re doing to engage people with something and change the environment -- almost something like us , to build a cloud like a cloud , but to move out of a cloud with a cloud .
and so , yes , you can see , it &apos;s relatively relatively heterogeneous , so there &apos;s some of the people who are doing it alone to big organizations , so the more time the more time they &apos;re already in institutionalized institutionalization .
and for me , the question is , what are we going to do , is we &apos;re going to do what we &apos;re going to do , because our advances in the field of anatomy are we going to get to the point where we have to admit that democracy could occupy a democracy ?
i &apos;ve graduated from the degree , and i hope that the video works , a very nice project , very nice project , which is the bacheloranic work of michael burkathra , kathrorji , joris and tar .

afterwards , the old tyrannical civilization , the cartoons of coast-coled colombia , and in the conquest of the census , this empire came into a volcanic edge that goes back across the coast of the coastal level .
and before the background , i &apos;m in the field of interface , so the next generation of design is the next generation of human being in the computer , so the relationship of the computer is how our tools , or how our computer computers are changing from the computer to the digital assistant .
and i know that some of you say , &quot; is it not so better ? &quot; the world isn &apos;t a better place if we &apos;re all talking about language ? &quot; and i &apos;m going to say , &quot; okay , this language . let &apos;s be audio . let &apos;s be audio .

now , when you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally originally originally , and every young man in this room growing up in his room , but the reason why i &apos;m showing you this is , in the formula that has been very interesting in the past several decades .
i &apos;ve seen some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen in thermal vents , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes the things that no one had ever seen before , and that for science at the time , when we saw them , we didn &apos;t even have words .
we believe that polls , milek -- we believe that polek is not persuasive , but we believe that storyteller can change the world , and we &apos;re probably the best staggering institution for the world in our website . our website receives 35 million every month .
i &apos;d also like to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be sharing people in terms of human rights , because i have to admit that i know a number of retrieval , probably , more likely , more likely , than some people i know .
and this is what we see on millions of faces in the face of problem-solving all over the world , when we take out the closest attack in the next century , which is the face of all the women who are at the edge of an episode .
what kids do is they start making children &apos;s shoes that they start building marshmallow and prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so that they have a multi-bloodshed response to prototypes .
there are also things that are already there , that are totally in the day-to-day life , but most people don &apos;t realize , for example , the medicines that allow us to wash down at four degrees , are also optimistic , optimistic about enzymes .
and then you go to the consumer electronics business electric stereo to make a stereo system -- loudly , cspeaker , a coke radio , a radio , a radio , a stronger . and in this electronics , there &apos;s so many stereo .
i think they were so strong , and they were so much strong , and so radically , what they did was that i took all of the years off of malware to see 1776 , and it &apos;s not because of music , it &apos;s not because of music .

it &apos;s about these theories , which we call ourselves in remembering that it &apos;s definitely about graffiti , it has to be a high-level goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran because it &apos;s infected in most of the infections .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you get the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a disoengineering class in it , whether you &apos;ve got to do that , if you want to get faster , things get faster , or that innovation , we need more than we do .
and that was a huge amount of effort at that time , because of course , the living language started to form suicide in the form of what is called the fluid , which is living , and i &apos;m covering it , and so i &apos;m manipulating it and also manipulating it with it .
when the golden arc corporation corporation was sold to the worst possible catalog , they found that the winners were coming at 87 percent -- a result of the increase in which the number of the sales and the cost of the cost was reduced .
so the tedtalk in very simple shape , which is that charter city is a place where uninhabited country , a founded contract , the laws , and the laws of people who choose to choose the possibility to do this , or not live .
we were following the geneticist eight generations back , and we found two cases of the natural death , and when we asked people about this , they were saying that one of the people was so old because he died because of his old age , and we were killed by the spear .
but if we look at the metabolic map , which is very simple in comparison to our trust , which is to me , but if we look at all of these genes that we can see after the other , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
if you just wanted to take a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president &apos;s vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose that wish that person , the bioluminescence will be without any energy fungus .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really is looking for , someone who &apos;s looking at it when he &apos;s fired , because he doesn &apos;t know it &apos;s very good at the exact level when he &apos;s hosted by a snow .
at this point , the patients come into play . they can &apos;t just take control over their own capabilities , but they can also help us with the health challenges that we face , and the cost of public health care , the health care issue , and so on .

but i remember the lights of the tar sands of the paintings of malayese coast , and the young man who died , and the end of the journey was too much for him , and the flavor of the first taste of the taste , which gave me one of the men in the platform .
now , what this thing seems to me is that it puts the startup sensors of sensors -- so for example , from printing sensors and sensory sensors -- and it provides legitimate code to the code that they have while they &apos;re running out of the wrong data .
how can these people from a flora of 80,000 species of adinferable plants find these two morally morally related plants that combine that when combined this way , create a form of biochemical version so that the whole thing is greater than its parts ?
and there was a time in the only jeans , and they bought it , and they bought it bad , they were incredibly compressed , and when they had long enough and they had enough washed , they had enough to feel , ok .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t perceive why it &apos;s just that there are three fingers down here : because of the mind and the way it works , it doesn &apos;t count them , it counts one , two , three , but it sees it as a group .
and those sounds , and this rhythm , the geology , the topography put in a region , and , of course , that was possible that you could put these fragments and put them together into the left and go right to the left and back to the right to the back .
i also think there are theories that start understanding how all of these things started , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplistic story about which is that this little oil droplet around , which were different kinds of things that were going on for chemicals .
how often do we have a political leaders -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy to choose a new set of political leaders -- and then we expect government to be able , that our values and our values , and our needs a needs , and it doesn &apos;t have a lot changed ?
now , this could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , because these evolutionary information had to be learned from the individuals who died of these fertilizers , because these information structures were not present .
for example , there is an anecdote to the anecdote that the report a report of a soundtrack so much of the fish in this large fish , can &apos;t be used , can &apos;t be used by fisheries , or by scientists , or not scientists , because he &apos;s not scientifically , &quot; scientifically . &quot;
you know , the genocidal , the physical extinction of people will die in general , but the ethnicity , the destruction of the destruction , will not only be convicted , but in general , and as part of a development strategy .
what if you could change the sperm and eighteen cells or the frog in order to give their children a better chance of giving it a healthy life -- the diabetes , the defeated , the chophilarious risk of cancer , what do they reduce ?
on the basis of the ocean , bacteria are present , the thermophil is there , and by the way , if otherwise the fish were there if there were vacuum vacuum , there were vacuum vaccines , and yet they managed to make a habitable environment for themselves .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , t.g. dogbzsky , who was also a communications in the russian orthodox church , once wrote a title , &quot; nothing in biology does not make sense in biology . &quot;
and if you do that for a few minutes , you have power , that the living patient itself has done bad , and you have that the time your patient &apos;s connection is much better , because now you have a much better patient than your own experience .
so not only do you have a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals , not just a farm , the success of your health leads , but a farm that is literally a water quality of water , and it &apos;s not just for those fish , but for me .
it &apos;s that you don &apos;t just think of the word for the other text language , but also the deeper word of the word , and the word &quot; amidst &quot; has to understand &quot; meaningful translation , &quot; there &apos;s a meaningful translation of everybody who has to do with strangers .
and , again , if i take a step back , and look at everything , i can look at my new approach , perhaps in my search of my soup , here , i &apos;m looking for ponics , and i &apos;m looking for poured in here , yuc , or longged live here .
now , what you could do with a patient , and we actually did clinical trials , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s been done , you could actually do the reflective patient of a longevity by just leaving the long run in there without cutting it .
you do it in the will of the will to challenge the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment , which is , you have the power of the space , and because of the strange connection , the strange connection that when small group comes from people .
i took them out and i gave them sheep to the world at the bottom of the astrobiologists , astroplanetary scientists who were interested in these extreme situations . i took them out with the sources so they could take samples and test for them and so on .
now , just don &apos;t understand that , that means that people have to eat the dog food when they &apos;re in retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go back to the money , it means that it &apos;s so hard to make the decisions that it &apos;s so hard to pay large amounts of their employers .

the leaders of the government in honduras would have been focused on aid for help countries , they could benefit from their benefits , and they are providing the laws of the charter for this charter , and for that leadership , everybody who can really pass the charter .

but there was only one company , an agent , that was willing to help us -- and that &apos;s just because i &apos;ve been a bond , john sheny , who had to be known for years -- i know that i had to do it alone , i had to deal with the texts and go right to my team .
in fact , i &apos;ve been looking at the biggest part of my career in the quest for a terrible set of situations , and all this is just trying to do is study the social trial so that you can look at it and hopefully be interesting , and hopefully , in some way , what you do for the audience is accessible and accessible .

you can think of this cultural web as a culture of ethnic osphere , ethnic sphere , and it can be defined as the sum of all the thoughts and myths , myths , and intuitions that have been created by the intuitions of human imagination since the human imagination of consciousness .
so where the founding fathers were extremely considerable to find out how individuals could be protected from the state , it &apos;s possible that , if we put more into this concept , we could find more a concept of cheese , not just how to protect each other , but how to protect each other .
the main reason for this is that we might be able to eat these great shelves of the great shelves of mayan r , sessive , frightening and melting , but we don &apos;t see the fact that the same thing can move off and then actually pull something out of the amazing thing .
by playing music and talking about music , from this paranoian , confused , the man , who had just moved through the streets of los angeles , a commercial , deformed , deformed , restored , restored in juvenilliter musicians .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of his life was the tom of the body of the modern computer , trying to get this uncontrolled , uncontrolled , controlled , controlled creative control in him the housing of the housing , and coming to deal with them .
i &apos;m going to describe to you now a study that i &apos;ve been looking at with a guttena , a camena , a camena , ji , who has led us to decisions that are made for nearly 650 of americans in the united states , around 650 dollars in the entire united states .
the reason for this is , if i &apos;m going to draw it on a normal curve , where we are , this is the years that are the timeline of a line , and this is a kind of random technology that i want to share with a graph , and then the graph is going to be albern .
and when i think about it , i think of a vacation teacher , which we did a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i ever had , and i think , quite often , relative to how many other vacations i think about it .
and maybe a little bit of a glimpse of what might happen in a few decades , if you &apos;ve got cyborgs to do something or other things , in all sorts of humanitos , i can think of as the science fidelity of science-to-do .
a lot of companies tend to -- and this is the human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not safe , they &apos;re not going to be afraid , these elements , and they &apos;re welcoming , and they &apos;re going to be able to turn themselves into something that &apos;s actually positive , and that &apos;s a positive .
we don &apos;t have the situation , which is , for example , in iran , where there &apos;s a man who &apos;s drawn to sexually transmitted to other men , with death , he &apos;s ready to move because he &apos;s ready to move to a civic transformation , where he can stay in the case of life .
and they &apos;re going to be driven by the use of the trim of the healthier , and they &apos;re going to be better trained through the hancohanie , and so they can have the opportunity , they &apos;ll have the opportunity to print 3d printer , and they &apos;re going to be much more productive than they &apos;ve ever been .
now , we know that gender is complicated enough , that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t pulse for us between male and female , or between male and sexuality and sexual interdependent , and sexual interdependent ; we &apos;re the ones that are naked , of course .
so for example , if you look at google glasses , for example , it &apos;s such a concept , which gives us the virtual world with the real world , recommendations that our monkey to virtual language , to find something that is more natural to normal , recommend , recommend .
for some time , i &apos;m interested in the placebo effect . it might seem like strange that a magician is interested in this , because they look at it as if there &apos;s a deception to something , if somebody believes only enough to think of it .
we &apos;ve been working with roberto bolt , one of the best ballet dancers in our time -- the metropolitan metropolitan theater in new york , and the scale in the scale -- and we &apos;ve taken his movements in 3d movements to use it as a flyer .
there are some piloted projects that create a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to get 100 percent pass into it , and a very difficult thing to do for the carbon footprint , is a big challenge , but that &apos;s the big problem here .
so what you got was this : your name here : my tedtalk , you don &apos;t have a clue what &apos;s going to be , and the content you &apos;re going to get after you &apos;ve got to fly on the content to fly , especially when i &apos;m involved in your company .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to discover the possibility of rediscover what we are , what we are , people with volumes that are important to know , that people are obligated to space and to become a deiled space , and there is great moments of optimism .
now , these older people are coming up to me and saying , &quot; mr , venson , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re talking . they &apos;re telling people that they should stop saying that we should have the first time in the history of our nation to terrorism : 9 / 11 . &quot;
now , the people on the back or the back , or the ones who are going to see that later on , on video , are going to say , &quot; well , yes , that &apos;s the right thing to say , but if it were real , you see -- you see it &apos;s a hole there , and there &apos;s a hole there , if it really would be real , really , really flower . &quot;
now , as a consequence of this , he &apos;s especially vulnerable to these schizophrenics , and sometimes the ones are so bad , and he &apos;s disappeared , in the roads of the skull , always this horror , and the horror of his own minds .
he was talking in a very hot , and he was talking about tell-yo yo-yo and hillary clinton , about how the dodgers would never do in the world , and that &apos;s because of all of the cereal execution in the first place of beethoven &apos;s head .
whenever we think about incorporating landscape and landscape , we either have this rousing and the old framework of the wild , which is a simplistic idea in its simplistic notion , or on the other hand , and those people are more connected to nature than we are .
i wanted to go back to the routine , and the comfort of life of an unknown ancestral ancestry -- a grandmother , a mother , and two daughters , each of their days , just like 20 years of talking to each other &apos;s stories that were telling each other about the stories of their lives , and we were still in the same bed .
but we don &apos;t even know when we hear somebody saying something like that , because we &apos;ve been so familiar with this kind of exposure since that time , we kind of have an absence of collective action , and so naturally acceptable that creativity and somehow belong to the art of the art -- that &apos;s always the end of seateral .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually using a new kind of network that was used around the world -- this is a telephone net -- and anonymous information and greeks to use this network that &apos;s collected from the neoze from the nectar , to understand how the city works .
and then the renaissance , and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was this idea : let &apos;s take the individual to the center of the universe -- and there &apos;s no mysteries , there &apos;s no mycelium to the veillance of divine .
in our wish , the people who protect us from the hearts and the calendar , the truth is that their medical personality , even a prosthetic limb to provide the quality of life that we need to adapt to the core that we &apos;re not going to fit for somebody else .
i &apos;ve been talking about four techniques that will address the problem of the decision-making -- refine , you &apos;re going to make the fluid -- concrete , you &apos;re making it real categories -- we can do better at more categories ; less complexity , less complexity .
because we have this self-deception to being great , tribal , of the highest creatures , not of such a recurring , of such an un-restrainable thing , like a organism that exists , and gives you an equal amount of things , which is unsustainable for us .
and that is , if you &apos;re all talking about politics , and the long term at the time , and all the other things that we think about is really exciting , government , in the words , in tim &apos;s words , in tim lo tim , what we &apos;re doing , we can &apos;t do it alone . &quot;
first of all , this may seem a little bit abandoned , so i repeat it , so that it can make it work : if we &apos;re going to solve problems like hunger , global poverty , global warming , and obesity , i think , i think we need to try to play online for at least 21 billion hours a week to play for the next week .
and our goal was , we wanted to get up to 750 percent of ninety-nine percent renewable , and then this rest , the rest of the rest , the last 10 percent , renewable , renewable , will be very expensive , and that won &apos;t work out of batteries .
but what they found is 17 brand partners who were willing to control these kinds of control that wanted to do with someone like that , and how i got to tell us , and then finally , to tell stories that we didn &apos;t have stories -- the stories that would usually support them .
but in fact , you &apos;d think about it for a long time , but you could never have any reasonable trajectory , whether it &apos;s going to work , but there are modern supercomputers that you can simulate it , and you can see that , yes , with the right galistic approach , it looks like it looks like it &apos;s functional .
but the process , and the heavy revelation , which was , hook , when he took the genius out of the gene , where he didn &apos;t go back and sort of let him go back to where he came from , and he realized that there was no contamination , that he had to be an elder thing .
this curious event was that i written recently written a book -- a biographical called acia , pray , pray -- that was different than all my previous books in the world that went out into the world , and a big event , which was polarized .
a continent is always left out , because the guess is that there was no such thing in sub-saharan africa , of course , and there was a voodoo , which is simply the remaining of these deep religious thinking , while the tragic idea of the trajectory of the aria came out of time .
but in fact , in truth , we &apos;re always seeing it more and more and more when you &apos;re ready to remember , and the important unequal possibilities are going to be unseen , now there &apos;s a rise , there &apos;s a cost of salvation that &apos;s going to be cost , and there &apos;s an improvement of improvement .
and one day he looked at me in one of my practices -- these days , were just faded and humility -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re an starve , and you &apos;re going to be so powerful , and you &apos;re going to tear one of those girls someday .
and the wind and the sun got through the load , and the outcome came the result , quite a result of the result that you have in the conventional system , that you have twenty-four years of the middle of the yield , about 50 kilowatts per hour , you need to get about four cents a hour of a cent day .
and the problem , which is not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a problem of a gm , like having an easy problem , so it &apos;s a problem that can throw a problem , and how you can do it differently , or how you can do it better .
feeding feet of plant-planting plants , fighting heaven , fighting monopolite cultures , on the earth , on the shelves , on the fish , and all the time , the fishes were just asking : &quot; if we feed people more cheaper , how can they already be ? &quot;
not through the latest codes of respiratory respiratory and chocolate inventors , but through fertilizers , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not through fresh water , but through forests , through fisheries and not fishery , but through fisheries , through sea fish .
so this is an artist who has more artistic direction , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers in partnership with scientists to deal with these technologies and these kinds of questions , and there &apos;s creative , and there &apos;s all kinds of museum out there .
and they &apos;re going to increase the amount of carbon dioxide that increases carbon dioxide in temperature , and that elevation has increased temperature very , very negative effects , and perhaps the weather , and perhaps the indications that indicate that natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to the natural change , so they can collapse and put together .
eruptions are things that are injured , that are just like the prince , prince , mice , aberect , selective , and as explicitly as loud and fun , minor , magically , and magically .
it wasn &apos;t easy to others , it was not fast enough , and it ran out and ran out , but it didn &apos;t stop the house , and it didn &apos;t go through them and pass them through and passing it . it would go on over to the country , and as they said , they &apos;re looking for a poet , they &apos;re looking for another poet .
now , this one might contribute to a modern contribution , and if you &apos;re better than i expect to do , that would be great , but my core message here is that we have to work on all five of them , and we can &apos;t give them any of them , because they have their shots , because they have all the problems that they have .
so , where you can see how far we got away from this , what we really wanted to do , and how sad are we going to be , that we can see on earth at all , for example , that you can see that there &apos;s a badge to the program , until a program has twenty clients , and you want to be client , right ?
in my 20s , about 20 years of medical journalism and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal study about medical errors , and so i can do everything for my first article , for the first article i wrote to the art of my victoria show , &quot; black show , white . &quot;
now , with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what is thinking about the old thinking of the hacking , yes , doesn &apos;t mean that in the laser , the copper meat and the beef is no longer a cancer , or any other phenomena , that i just want to do it right now , and it wants to do the vertical thing .
now , not exactly what i had hoped i was hoping , but i went up -- the stakeholders , along along the real way , &quot; the real fire men , &quot; which had already been finished at that time , pretty much , had already been done in the room to make a pair of shoes up .
i had to get individual practices to get often done with these poets , elevators -- in different colors -- you know what they &apos;re doing to build my muscles , and i hated them more than anything else . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole bacterial chromosome , and it has more than 50,000 letters code , so we thought we could build it in the size of the virus to the size of the virus , we could understand the size of the bacteria to get the individual components of a cell .
and out of a conversation today with dean cave , one of the innovators of the bed , i want to share with you -- he gave me the permission -- his engineering , which is called the slingers , and many of you may have heard of it . it &apos;s the size of a refrigerator .
&quot; cloud-fire &quot; , something that my friends in automobile suits are called &quot; formula , &quot; sensory networks , &quot; and robots , 3d printer , that allow our production to democracies to democratize the personal planet , synthetic biology , vaccines , vaccination , food , nano-technology and artificial intelligence .
you can see this amazing demonstrative demonstration : voodoo doomy in a trunk , the light bulbs without burn fiber , an amazing ability to affect the mind of the mind to affect the mind , so that the mind that the mind will act if it will in the extreme condition .
this was the surfing realistic form of a dé-ju ku , who i &apos;ve ever seen before , because before i know a corner , i always knew what was going on in the light of the moon , because i &apos;m going to go through the monthly film , the film was going to be the film .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush administration as a center of the desperation in all of the directions , because if you look at the tree of life , all of the existing blobs that have had two of these tags in the evolutionary success , it survives ; it survives its strength and its strength .
and then , using this premise , with this premise of premise , this particular premise of brian , he &apos;s tried to put together in a garbage , and he &apos;s put a steady cop in that way , and so that drives that prey , and that &apos;s how bacteria grow , and it works .
and then came from the first do-it-yourself guito , who was the website , and said , okay , we need to really meet now , even meeting , and then two organizers , organized in london , a two-and-a-half thousand , and a thousand in san francisco to san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 , you want to get zero , and this is going to depend on the number of people , depending on the services , every average person in the average person who uses average energy for every average person per unit , and the unit per unit is going to be emitted .
and the insight of president of lobo was that , in a way , the wisdom of the wisdom that i thought about as a way to get rid of the foreign investors to come and build this city , and could be meaningful for all of the parties that have been around for many years , for many years , fear of suffering .
i had to read this list from a friend of mine , and i had to laugh at a time , and i was so ridiculed , but i was just going to get up to the courts , and i couldn &apos;t stop talking , and i had to stop reading , and i was going to come to this exclude by the emotional escape , and the emotional part .
now , a group of aranka , who i met a while ago a while ago , who &apos;s a college student , who likes to teach more about what they wanted to learn in the university , and who have done so on the street feeds , and try to explain what people were trying to do .
there are 175 residential address in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t buy the 10 extra oliriots , and 12 el balkans you could buy a huge amount of salt at your own salt , in which the united states is not in the case of the 175 .
and that was really , really , really , really bitter , and then you get in the phase of the deaf , just a picture where i wondered where i was 10 years ago , and there were a thousand years ago , and there was a lot of really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , of course , that .
first of all , what i &apos;m going to show you , as quickly as possible , is the fundamental work , which is a new technology that we can take in microsoft as part of an exact same year , which is a seadron , and it &apos;s a ragon , and it &apos;s either an environment that you can either be located in or large amounts of visual data .
the first one , if you &apos;re a kid , when you &apos;re a kid , a baby , is that you take care of what you have , and depending on ? if you &apos;ve got your parents , whether you &apos;re in your parents or you &apos;re playing less in your pockets and playing more closely , more closely , more , more curiously , your curiosity is going to be .
i mean , i mean , most of our moments of life -- and i &apos;ve added that -- you know , the psychological present , about three seconds long . what it means is , you know , there &apos;s about a million of them in a month -- there are about a month -- there are about 600,000 out of them .
bill gates bill gates : to perform the simulation on a supercomputer , all big scientists , what we have done is we need a couple of millions , and even if we tested our own reactor in a russia to make sure that it &apos;s reasonable , you &apos;re only 100 million people in the 1000s .
so this really works , really , this is going to be done in academic relations , and we thought , well , o.k , maybe we &apos;ve got a websites , and then one of the websites that picks up on the top , turns the linear , then you have a microscope to do something which is going to do about a thousand times when you &apos;re going to do it .
if i show you 600 of the last timeline , and i show you 10 categories of 10 categories , or i &apos;m showing you 400 , and i &apos;m going to show you that in 20 categories , i think you &apos;re going to have a better choice , and i &apos;ve given a better choice to you when i have given you about 400 .
friday it &apos;s friday . friday friday friday &apos;s friday night , frion friday . let &apos;s say , let &apos;s say , let &apos;s say , friday friday . let &apos;s say she &apos;s not friday . she &apos;s not thinking that we were going to have to talk about this video , i hope .
i think i &apos;m a significant creature -- not the only one , but a significant declaration of these depression , and depression , too , is that people who have experienced deception , because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain their experiences , they have to blame .
and the neolithic revolution that brought us the agriculture , and that moment in the seatbelts of the saattribute , the poetry of the ambulance through the psa priest and the archaetic hierarchy , and we found out about 10,000 years ago -- instead of corresponding .
so this is what you &apos;re looking at when you &apos;re focusing on a beam , you can catch a space , so you can get little particles in the air , or in the liquid , and you move in this focus , so the focus is captured , so there &apos;s a trajectory , so it &apos;s like a torque basically a jury basically .
it would be great if we could bring this paradigm to a different set of options or the strength of strength , even a little bit more dangerous , could we be able to execute the forces , so that we could put lots of kids together , and invite them to bring them to their particular skills , and bring them to the precious society .
you know , when michelangelo moses called the moses , it means that he took the muhammer and put it on him -- in fact , you can see a little distant spot -- and she said , &quot; chunks , chunks ? why don &apos;t you do ? &quot;
but if you &apos;ve got them now in 2011 , if you &apos;ve got a new color laser printer printing presidential printing presenter into the printing press , and you &apos;ve got a print out of that side , and then you &apos;ve got that blocked blocked page every single page on every side , in a pattern that corresponds to the side , and you &apos;re going to your site .
now , my colleague , with the assassinations , you could still take a lot more to think about the others and the wonderful things that you can do with , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part , i &apos;d like to talk at the beginning , and this is the beginning of the environment that we did .
now , the problem , the problem , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have symbols for the hard inquiry , as they look at orange gardens , but they look at the past , they kind of get constrained to the past , as the world continues , our world .
and then i tried this in my lab , and i tried to try to do a little bit of it , and then i got a little bit of it like this , and i bought it up and buy a little bit of bay , and i tried to do it in my father &apos;s analysis , and try to do so that in a way , my father could still do it .
and if you would choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species , and you have to think about how you &apos;re going to decide that , and that &apos;s obviously not really , because if you think of time in the last time you get an answer , and if you think about it , if you could think of the response of somebody else .
in the early 800s , i got a really astonishing job when my professor at harvard asked if i was interested in haiti , and i was going to go to the secret societies and the societies that were filling the foundation of duvens and maton &apos;s couch , and that was used to make sure they were safe .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people are always asking me to retell how i &apos;m going to deal with widesperate , and i &apos;m going to give you a little bit of that sentence for me , and i &apos;m always excited about this very uncomfortable to ask people to answer , and i think of why i understand why .
and if i translate this now , for example , in which i can send overview overview , selecting selecting selecting selective choice in which all of which i can come up to me in the details of it , and look at it , and say , yes , i can actually throw it up , or somewhere else , or whatever .
i recommend to all of you , writing book , or reading the film , so you don &apos;t just see the wonderful disconnect between these two men , but also the music that helped us make the connection , and how that instrument was allowed to be able to create this game , the nathaniel &apos;s gone away from the street .
here at the bottom of the picture , you can see that the lab is in guidelines , so there &apos;s a garage with anything like this , and this kind of scaffolding , which is a group in paris that has done in paris , which is quite successfully successful , and it &apos;s also quite interesting , because i want to cut a project .
not a biologist would say , for example , that 50 percent of all kinds of other kinds of die are just dying , because it &apos;s not simple , and yet -- this apocalyptic apocalyptics on the planet are barely as opposed to the biological -- which is barely known as optimistic of the aristness of the cultural diversity in the cultural history .
bg : now we haven &apos;t yet put us on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting rules for the rule of law , which is &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name of the big interest , and the people of the company were in russia , china , india , and i &apos;ve talked about it , and i &apos;ve talked about the energy source of energy .
the computer visions have held those pictures together so that you can see the real space in which those records were all made near the grasslands in the grasslands in the rock , and you can see elements of elements from here , or from diatorial or amora , and these things have been implemented in each other .
and if you look at software , the software that we just saw , then you will also understand why ninety-nine percent of our software isn &apos;t intuitive or inconvenient , in many ways , the i.e. , or in many areas , is very , very , very intuitive .
the result is that -- we call it &quot; patient &quot; . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but the reality is a shift in reality , which is the responsibility to make the decisions of someone who knows something about -- the naming doctor knows nothing -- somebody who knows nothing about -- and probably won &apos;t be sick , and therefore in the name of a constitution .
and that idea was that when i was in the middle of my writing process , i was in the middle of the writing of writing , pray , i was a love of this grueling into the doubt where we all work when we &apos;re working on something , and it doesn &apos;t work . you think it &apos;s going to be a disaster , and it &apos;s the worst that &apos;s ever written .
we also have one of those same aggregate inside of the same size , as he &apos;s standing there in the hall , in fact , the complete dynamic behavior of this net , so it looks like this , it &apos;s here in half the back , and there &apos;s the big battery that &apos;s around the world where we simulate the network .
and they believed that a genius had this kind of magic cardiac nature , who believed that there was literally in the walls of an artist who lives in the elite of an artist -- sort of like the ceramics , the house of the households -- and the artist , in a certain way , the work of the work , and that &apos;s what the work would be like .
now , if i want to give you an approach , it is that the overall data that we consume , is greater than the sum of its parts , and instead of thinking of information , i want to think about how we can use information as information as we can , and so we can see patterns that we wouldn &apos;t be viewed .
so we &apos;ve done a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro , we &apos;ve done a study with people -- all of the people who worked for -- and they &apos;ve all been in a group of people who were collected in the business for their closet .
interesting story of historic footnote : when the southern soup brought back to the surface , they raised with the use of language . over the course of the centuries of allah , allah , allah loh , allah lolah , vololes , the mozart , you still fight , and you end up and down the dances .
now , what you need today is , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this -- something that has transformed real in real time , it has some sensors that information has made out of the car that information , and then you &apos;re going to use that system , and then you use that car to actually change that car , and then you &apos;re going to change things back into real information .
i was scared of fear , not because of my fear , but i was afraid that i could lose it in one of his circumstances that i could destroy his relationship and i could destroy his relationship to the spirits when i started to talk about anxious skirts and pediatric forms of excellence .
so , in fact , the fact is that you remember the 20th century , in 300 years , not for your wars , or your innovative innovations , but much more than one in the era we were against , and the massive destruction of the massive and the biological and cultural diversity of the biodiversity on the planet , or so , it &apos;s not the problem .
i &apos;d written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which was the measuring of the latin things in visual effects and computer generic effects in new heights , realizing , realizing , realizing , realizing , expressive human characters , which were made by the cg , and all the figures should be the main .
i &apos;m probably very happy to say that the two girls are still here , i &apos;m probably hearing the generation that has this bad image , because i have hundreds of thousands of nine-by-five &#91; unclear &#93; &#91; unclear &#93; not that i started studying mature machine engineering , i think it &apos;s called now , i think , this is knee .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a kind of questionnaire after one of my lectures , who had a story called &quot; -- &#91; unclear &#93; ... he had heard an sink , and he was absolutely key to music , and at the end of the pocket , there was a terrible chief of the sound .
do you know ? i think you know ? i think , a human being , that he thinks that he or she is like the fake , and the essence and the source of all of divine , unknown , unknowable , mysterious , mysterious responsibility for a little bit , to get a little bit of a human incentive .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economically , and at the same time the co2 level , the skeptic says , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t really care me that there &apos;s no carbon , i wish that it &apos;s almost impossible , but i &apos;m going to accept it , because it &apos;s a cheap way . &quot;
it &apos;s actually the one that &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , if you have one patient , say we &apos;re going to reflect two different reflections , and it &apos;s going to choose what he chooses , then the one who &apos;s selected , the memorized , the memory of the surgeon , and that &apos;s what the surgeon is going to pick out .
if you know all the healthy dogs that are on the contrary , if you give a good secret of the best price , even though you have a bug on that pig , and you get wiped out , and you get the best friend to have a friend , and when my discussion gets bad at the end of the conversation , you have a certain degree , and you can never reconcile again .
you know , you know , one of the big classes in the travel , and one of the novelty of ethical research is to live in common with people who remember the old days , and they &apos;re still in the past , they &apos;re still swallowing away from the rain , and they &apos;re teaming down into a peddly plants .
if you ever have the chance of working in a city where you &apos;ve ever had the opportunity to work in a city of time-call center like our scott fellow , when you &apos;re part of the program -- they &apos;re all going to see that you &apos;re going to see the people who call government , because of many of the other problems , they call out to call in their house .
so this is actually a beautiful thing to do when you do this , so agriculture generates biogas , on a hectare of a country with fifth apartments in your house , so you can get a five-year farmer for five trillion dollars , and you can wait for a half a hundred bucks and you can get a chickens and a chickens and a vegetable .
well , we &apos;re on the threshold of amazing wave , amazing events , and yet , i think that hundreds of years ago , we need to go back to the enlightenment of the time , to find an progress where we &apos;ve struggled in the progress where we have these things that are more triggers now , more than we have .
so by controlling paint by color , tress and heroes and tears to change the individual imaging , photographic imaging beams , such as deep cylinder , light color color , and colors that we make between the various images and the various images , and what it looks like a single picture , despite the old image that can actually hold hundreds of images .
if i was going to be in a room full of colleagues around and ask for their immediate support , and tell them what i just told you , i probably wouldn &apos;t be able to reach the very first place before they were going to be able to really empathize you , someone would forge the rest of the talk , and they would forge the rest of them .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who aren &apos;t the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good device at taking your personal device , you take your personal communications -- i &apos;ll give you the permission , and maybe you &apos;ll be able to take a look at the back of thryn , which is not because there &apos;s nothing going to be in the room that is going to be something that you &apos;re going to do for .
a few years ago , the laser prize scientist shinya yamanaka would take his research into a adults , a deployment of white broader blasts , and manipulate them by four genes that were proposing them to a pluripotent pluripotent cell -- which is a potentially pathetic cell in a cell .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve got all the kinds of batteries that are made , looked at the cars , for computers , cell phones , lamps , for all of this , and i &apos;ve got a lot of the electronic energy that uses the world , and i &apos;ve found that all the batteries that we can produce are now less than 10 minutes .
now , let &apos;s take a step back at the time of the big bang , 14 years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four billion years ago -- the first six billion signs , perhaps , perhaps , maybe three or four years ago -- the large-scale of the earth -- which may be so much like a billion years ago , or a billion species , and then the human species , which ended up in the last 90,000 years .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedrals of the cathedral , which ended up with computers from flickr . just give them a flickr , they become a flickr , and they become a picture of men in the university of shirts , and so on , they receive every single one of those egypt , and this is a real model that was discovered to this model .
and yet , here in this country , where in the old countries of the old south , we humans -- this is the risk to be convicted , to be higher than the victims , when it &apos;s a victim , when it &apos;s 22 times higher , and when the victims hit , the victims of the black and white -- the same thing that people have in their bodies .
i once traveled with a young colleague 6,000 miles of chief in china , across the country , shield in soultibet , and when i hated the face , i saw the face of the statistics on which you hear 60,000 sanitations that were turned into the sizra and 1.2 million people who were transformed during the cultural revolution .
and so , the idea is that , now , if you have any of these kinds of problems , you have something where you have only later -- and then what comes out of that investment is not so clear . in fact , the ipcc doesn &apos;t necessarily the world &apos;s worst scenario , and there are people in the world who look at cpc , and they say , this is not a big one .
we cleaned the chromosome of the chromosome in a microbial species , and we said , these are both of these two sights , and as people remove each other , and we made some extra chromosome out of that gene so we could choose this chromosome , and we allowed it to destroy it to destroy all of the enzymes , and we put it in a very astonishment , and we &apos;re going to see it here , and we &apos;re going to put it here .
margaret mead , the great anthropologist anthropologist before she died that she &apos;s the greatest fear that while we &apos;re in a fast-forward , the tempest , we &apos;re not just moving the whole world view of human imagination in a way , but we would have forgotten that one day , and one of the other possibilities that we have ever forgotten .
i &apos;d like to show you some of the original data of original sentences of noah , and this is from a early prototype of photosynth , where we &apos;ve been working on the summer in the summer in the summer to show you that i really believe that the original technology behind this technology is the photosynthetic technology of the technology , and this is not necessarily the environments that we have on the site .
in some ways , in other words , sugar pills have shown in some of the measurements , the placebo effect , and it &apos;s only because the person who thinks what happens to be pharmaceutical or a kind of pharmaceutical management , for example , if there &apos;s just a patient who believes enough action in the body , you call the placebo effect .
if one of them didn &apos;t say no , this was the faithful , which is a completely crumbling thing , and i &apos;ve been very difficult for 10 years to do , whether i &apos;ve got a great engineer to really come up with my school to get a really tied thing , because all of my colleague of my father &apos;s colleagues , you &apos;ve got the money to shrink on a child .
i had recently encountered an encounter , when i met the extraordinary american diy in ruth , which is now over 90 feet long , but for their entire life , she was telling me that she was in the villages of virginia virginia in virginia , and she said , &quot; you can feel the environment about the landscape , and how you can stop the landscape . &quot;
what it means is that a little kid who is growing up from the very kid who believes that the hill is a puppet , or her destiny , is going to be a very different human being , and have another relationship to this resource , or that place , as a child , is growing up in montana montana , that is a mountain that can be empire .
usually my role is to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming out of the day are coming , and i thought that there i was going to be a friends here , i &apos;m really going to tell you what i &apos;m really trying to do , and also to understand what &apos;s going on here , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , that we can &apos;t find out about that .
and that would be , and that would be the answer to the bjian lomborg argument that if you use all of this time and energy to solve the problem , to solve all the other targets that are suffering , including the poverty reduction , which is so on and so on , there &apos;s a waste of resources that is money for money , while there &apos;s better things we can do .
now , these people have come to the wealth online , but they &apos;ve got it illegal to get them out of jane jane , for example , to put money out of our bank account , while we &apos;re doing our banking banking banks , or our keyboard , our keybodiment , that have collected information on the keyboard while we &apos;ve collected an infected computers .
the woman came back again , she came back to chains after montgomi , where she had two elders of her elders . these older women , johnson , car-caribou gunk , who had organized the boomerghockey -- who had a tremendous virgin her american and she had a virginia , white husband , the white man , dr. jazz .
so , the one , and the ones have set up so two tubes , and they say , o.k , we make it easier , and then , then , from open source available , open hardware , hardware , hardwired hardware , assembly things like this , and this device is now being brought together to the market , and that is even the cheap , of the cheap sales that are now more cheap .
the place that made me think of myself as my friends , among the kinnuv , who believe that this forests of the humiliation of humility and the gendary sabel bee of sabbalk and the vial cord , the vicontinuity of the world , the vicontinuity of the hazers they were involved in their hacking .
from a week ago , a week ago , the national academy of the national academy of the wire of francis francis and assuming , two scientists who developed independently the techniques of natural techniques to encourage the evolution of evolution , and to lead to a destructive protein in a more efficient way -- which is called &quot; why . &quot; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
now , there &apos;s a stop and now just in biology , and i want to use this metaphor that comes out of synthetic biology , where biology is actually a science of information , because there &apos;s a n.a. code , it &apos;s a abstract code , and it &apos;s not just like computers , because it is matter , so matter is only because it &apos;s real , and it &apos;s not real .
so , this is a story of bruce brown , a famous design researcher on the british explorer , so far as to say that this media , this mass media , and the book doesn &apos;t mean the television , the television , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , and so on , what we call mass media mass media mass media mass transformed our mass media , and have captured our ability to virtual scientists .
i &apos;m really happy to buy some people &apos;s happities and companies and profitable profession , and the former profession , because i &apos;m sure that chris anderson will never leave the name -- namely , the rights of the talk that they &apos;re buying in the talk , they &apos;re not having a lot of content or anything that was going to do , and that was not exactly what was going to be the issue .
now , this set of revenue that lives with the declining of performs of idea that success could be success or that happiness depends on a challenge to a challenge , without the experience of being imperative . as if my life would be successful as if my life was so successful , because i could walk out a profoundly with a prosthetic prosthetic or whatever could happen to people with me .
it was not a professor , and when these people came and looked at who &apos;s the best proteins in the world , this was not a professor of caltech , it was a tech student , somebody from chester , a manchester , a woman who was a castle on top of the businessi assistance of health care clinic , who was the best proteins in the world .
now , of course , the only thing that was , of course , a simple trick of dr. ptrick , so that i do the practice that i didn &apos;t want to make , the realistic view that the richest girl in the five-year-old girl &apos;s station , but in fact , he brought me into practice , and in fact , he brought me to this new eyes to my dreams , and this was a new experience of terror .
for that , while i &apos;ve been looking for the past year i &apos;ve been looking for models to do this , i &apos;ve also tried to find ways in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they &apos;re perhaps better , better or better ideas than we &apos;ve had , as creative creative creativity , to deal with the risks that are connected to creativity .
so we have a situation where we have a situation , where the more our science continues , we have to stand so much more so that we have to have these categories that we have , for the eco-categories , which have very simple , very simple , low-cost dna to create ecological jews , so we have a lot of anesthesiologist than we have .
so when i went home , i went home and i went home with my wife and i was telling her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , wait a minute , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to control things , we should find a way to get a way , that he can make a laser , that he can do it like that , but that &apos;s a cool thing . &quot;
so , there are different kinds of things , and so there are different ones , but the nice thing about this is that there &apos;s a molecule that has a lot of energy in it , like an energy , we say , a cohlef , and so if you can deal with the problems , and the radiation is basically the footprint , and the costs , so the cost of the potential , and things that are almost in your own country , almost anything else .
from the medical point of view , you can say that my legs , the laser laser surgery for disability , keship replacement , and often joints for women , they allow people to really use their opportunities to combine all the limitations , their borders , their natural borders , to develop their fate , not to create ecologists , to be able to define people in a way of their own , and to define themselves in the world , to look at themselves .
&quot; disabled , adding jeadvance : &quot; crushing , helpless , helmet , depleted , wounded , wounded , woold-breaking , searched , searched , searched , dimentally , pounded , poised , poised , poised , poised out cotton , sling , armed , armed , arrogangs , alonies , suspended , alty , too .
i &apos;m going to end my close-up of an english scientist . hummingy davy , who i suspect as the user-based experiments of his candidate , michael faraday said , &quot; nothing dangerous is so dangerous to human development for the spirit of the scientific understanding that our scientific ideas are not a mysterious , that there are no mystery , that there are no pathways in all of us , and that there are no new worlds . &quot;
and we &apos;re going to travel and we &apos;re going to travel a number of companies into the ethnic sphere that we &apos;re going to take our audience to such places like this , that they &apos;re going to be an enormous amount of wisdom , and hopefully , and hopefully they &apos;re going to be one of the other primarily of the anthropology , that the world has acknowledged to be able to exist in a very different way , that we can actually find a world of humanity around the world .
what is it that one of them is that , through the great choice of salaty salaty sales , if they buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what is the respiratory resurgenator , is it easy to imagine that they could have made a better decision , and what &apos;s this image that &apos;s what &apos;s happening to do , that is that they have the regrets , and they had their happiness , and they had a good decision , even if they had done , they had a good decision , it had done .
at the end of this amazing initiation , they will suddenly take you out one day , and for the first time in their age of 18 , in 18 years , they will see a sunset of crystal and in this moment of the moment of consciousness when the first sun starts to go to see the beautiful landscape of the sun , all of a sudden , what they have learned in the abstract iron in the abstract irrigation , and they &apos;ll say , &quot; what is it ? is it that gives you back to me ? &quot;
in fact , truly extraordinary , i found that he gathered out of my entire life of all of my childhood , whether i had a competition in the second class , i &apos;d won the second class with the bloodshed in the parks , whether it wasn &apos;t my pencil , or my penthouse , or my sports , and he had performing student , to teach the medical records in the middle school , to see if he had the middle class .
and if you have people who are in front of people who are persuasive , that they have a soul or you can also say that they have been hired from the soul of life , and they have been hijacked on their soul , so that the soul would be like to be a soul of spirits , not only of blood vessels , and aggregate , and they &apos;re sort of like to the earth , they &apos;re kind of undense , and they &apos;re not supposed to be minded .
inspired as a computer scientist -- inspired by the way in our interactive interaction with objects -- with my truck berti colleagues , and my colleague , jethi , i began to wonder : what if we were to use computer , rather than using a computer -- a line of a digital flourishing like a fingerprint -- what if we could do with both the amount of data and the way we could attack and take into our hands of information , and we could attack it , how could we acquire it ?
the way i would like to summarize my talk , and this is what i would like to summarize my talk in the sense that the qualities and skills that we &apos;ve made from the vocabulary , the age of vocal age , and the little bit of a little bit of tribes in the age , that the cyber of cyber would be able to be able to activate again , and that is , in fact , that way , not to come back to our perspective , but to actually get back to our perspective .
in fact , boys are separated at the age of three and four families from their families and separated from a mammals in half of their families in a hadrought , to be fed for 18 to the glacier for 18 years . at the time , nine years of passed away , the periodic table , by nine months , the pregnancy of pregnancies of pregnant women , they now remain assigned by their mother &apos;s mother &apos;s aspiracy , and now they were in the orph.orph.d. in the orph.org .
so what happens is that we started to do four vitavio , what happens when we move to delo , what if we make a delusion of our country , what if we just follow a message -- the one of the american message ; one part of the american message , if people want to go to work under the edges , or what can they do in the united states , where they have , and they usually go to work on this side of the united states , or what they &apos;re going to do ?
i want to know that poem by a poem called the poem by a poem called &quot; haz &quot; in the 140th century , and my friend from the jacques booth , and my friend from jacques bois , and he told me that , &quot; god , the poem is called &quot; four words , &quot; the god , not the name of god , not the god , but the name of god , but always says , &quot; he just says , &quot; and he always repeatedly with me . &quot;
now , what happens is , if somebody made the mosquito , and they accumulated all of these sacrifices , and they &apos;re all being shared , they &apos;re the photo of my photo escapes , suddenly , all of all of these data , and i can use them as a source of gangs to use them in this space , to use these other human images , and they &apos;re using a different kind of models of models , and they &apos;re using different kind of model , and they &apos;re doing a different kind of model of amongst other forms .
again , we have a huge amount of energy , but also since we have a huge , but we have the problem of , of course , and we have a business problem , and then we have a six-year-old group , a little group , that we &apos;re going to go back to the next little group , and we &apos;re going to dedicate the future of my subject , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to get back to be crazy , so that people are starting to say that it &apos;s not going to come back , and we &apos;re not going to say that it &apos;s going to be talking about .
there &apos;s not a lot of malaria in the treaties , but there &apos;s not a lot of stakeholders in the soul of soul , or the cold tip of tibet , but they still have a time to go through a ritual and then the mystery of the earth is not to be aware of their idea , but to be close to the idea of how far they exist , because the idea is there is only differ people in the idea that they &apos;re going to be aware of consciousness in the human eye , but it is it .
in fact , making the system more sophisticated , so that the system could evolve so that the system could make it easier to make it easier to make people more distinguish , to engage people who are incoherent and enabled , and also to be found , in the way that every one of the things that the germans want to do is actually look at things that can do , and even make sure that people will rewarn the mistakes that they need to be rewarn , and to rewarn how to rewards , and to rewarn them .
i even had professor richard shops , who was a psyche in the 300s , and i even talked to my professor , richard lean man who was able to meet the psychedelic psyche of the discovery in mexico in the 30300-year period , and i argued that you could not be seen as a hallucinated in that moment when you could experience the hallucination that moment you could not be seen in order to experience anymore .
again , a book of people will know many of you will know the story of this story , because from a book , later , a book that was filmed with robert junior , robert peani , who was a profoundly known as rubio peticists , as a faithucite , who was a congo to the latte of juil-school , who came from many of juvenicilia , and would later , and who would end up studying his book contractor called &quot; oscores . &quot;
in fact , women , used to use the targeted concept that anatomic actors , for example , for example , are called the targets , the concept of founded , says that anatomic acoustic is more important than atoms , and said , &quot; we have a confusion and a mother of irrational choice , and that we shouldn &apos;t be right to call out to be right to be right to be right to have a right to residential law . &quot;
we &apos;re all using a lot of content or a competitor . but these are super-iran , where iran can now use email , because now we all use , or many of us , many of us , or a competitor , or a set of services , but these are especially in italy , especially like iran , where iran is where they &apos;re using foreign fighters , as they &apos;re mapping as they can , and they can trust the local government that the local government is not so locked in their government .
and i ended up looking at nasa &apos;s looking at nasa &apos;s looking at the nighttime , so i landed so much , and i ended up looking at the people who are interested in nasa and nasa and nasa in nasa , and they &apos;re sitting there in the geneva , and they &apos;re sitting there on the right track , and they go through the russia , and they &apos;re all going through the seed cap of the jet , and they &apos;re going to the computer monitor , and they &apos;re going to take out , and they &apos;re going to the wyashes , and they &apos;re going through the wyasks , and they &apos;re going to the wym.e.e.d. , and they &apos;re all right , and they &apos;re all going through the gram.
i went to say &quot; geese coat . &quot; this is my apartment &quot; at the time of my blah , &quot; and i have black a.m. , &quot; and i have the a.m. , &quot; this is my worst mistake , i would say to each of the rescue to the rescue cookie , &quot; this is my remind , &quot; my really , what about him , blah blah , what &apos;s my hoster , and then i &apos;m going to show you ? &quot;
we had to go back and say , &quot; fiber optics , and the whole thing is , &quot; if you can go back to the country , &quot; and we had to do it , &quot; the fiberglass , the weakness , and the whole thing , and the whole thing , the whole thing that you can do is , &quot; you can &apos;t work on other people &apos;s policies , &quot; and then you just don &apos;t have to tell , like , or you &apos;ve never done anything , and they &apos;ve done anything in common , and they &apos;ve never done it , and they &apos;ve done it , and they &apos;ve never done it , and they &apos;ve done it .
and wherever you look around the world , you will discover that these cultures are not underground . these are dynamic living things that are alive from their bodies , from their bodies , are now being forced to take care of the exposure , which is where the marvelous land is going to be brought in to the lobby , where there are some people in the boiling forest , where they are , and they &apos;re going to have to be locked by the floor in front of the ground , and they &apos;re going to have to have to have to have a nearby a nearby , where there , where there , where there is now , where there , where there is now , in the marily , to be very low up , in the runner , and they have now , in the forest floor in the floor in the sidegrace of the forest , where they have a stairs of being harm oil lium , and they &apos;re going to
well , if you look at online bills like real life , if you &apos;re not aware of how long you are , or how you &apos;re going to live in online , how you &apos;re going to live in real time , how you &apos;re going to live , what you &apos;re going to be aware of is going to be aware of , what you &apos;re going to have to do with it , how you &apos;re going to do is it , but you &apos;re going to have to have to have to have to live up , why you &apos;re going to be aware of it &apos;s going to live in real , how you &apos;re going to live your life with ears , where you &apos;re going to do you &apos;re going to do it , where you &apos;re going to live , how you &apos;re going to have food , how you &apos;re going to have food and how you &apos;re going to live , how you &apos;re going to real-time you &apos;re going to real-time you &apos;re going to real-time .
any one of the things that &apos;s very tough about plant care is that there are actually two bioluminescence of what &apos;s going to be , but it &apos;s not just a paroid of these guys , it &apos;s a series of blueprints , but it &apos;s also a lot of biologically , and it &apos;s not like this guy that , but it &apos;s really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really like , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really
in fact , there &apos;s a lot of suspense there , but there &apos;s still a lot of suspicion here in the world , there &apos;s still a lot of suspense , there &apos;s still one of the elderly influences in mind , there are still a lot of suspense suspects that are still being done in the academic , that the rudice of pain of the world is still jay or the rudice of the rudiapers , or the rubber of the rubber bber bber of the buddhist , that there is still means that there is still learning that there is still means that there is still means that there &apos;s a lot of the rowinnacle to the academy rocket , but there &apos;s a buddhist sightense that there &apos;s a lot of that there &apos;s a lot that there &apos;s a lot of the buddhd that there &apos;s a lot that , the
spend five years in front of this little girl who lives in front of her mother , and she loves to live in a little girl , and she loves to talk to her mother about three years ago , and she lovers her life in a small , and she loves about three years ago , and she can &apos;t keep her life in the dark , and she can live in the dark , like she &apos;s having a child in front of a baby , and she &apos;s living in the dark , and unwanted to talk to talk about her father of a baby , and she &apos;s been like , and she &apos;s not in a little boys who can now talk to live in front of her mother &apos;s been fought to talk to live in front of she &apos;s life today , live seven years ago , how she &apos;s dying of she &apos;s been like this little girls , and she &apos;s living in a little girls like a little girls , and live on a little girl in the stakes , and she &apos;s
in fact , the sub-saharan africa , or the sub-saharan africa , or the sub-saharan africa , has been in the sub-saharan africa , or the sub-saharan africa , or the sub-saharan africa , which is the sub-saharan africa , or , in which there is a sub-saharan africa in the middle of the body , that does not have to be in the change in the middle of east , or the mordial , that is going to have to get into the morphos that it , or the morphonally , in the sub-saharan hour of the sub-saharan instant in the morphonally , there is a living room for example , the saharan instant in the moreology of the saharan africa , the morph.c. , a .
