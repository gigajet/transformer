from seattle ...
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s singing .
but it goes .
don &apos;t find it .
yes , hello .
we love innovation .
solar technology is ...
that &apos;s not ...
we were poor .
are they all ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
after a week .
great trick ?
we were .
a few less .
and he says ...
we know that .
ta-da !
wait twice .
here it is .
that goes fast .
they need time .
music as language .
that &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... not yet .
thank you .
what a fish .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
that &apos;s efficient .
wonderful , right ?
completely inefficient .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much .
hills them .
the only chance .
also no hospital .
thank you .
stephen watts .
three out of 10 .
that was incredible .
thank you . thank you !
yes , sort of .
it &apos;s terrible .
long , yes .
fantastic , right ?
the sun goes to the sun .
oh my god .
we love entertainment .
we pick up .
where ? where ?
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we lose them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
a whole lot .
does this sound sound good ?
the whole environmental debate .
sounds familiar , what ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
that &apos;s great .
that was fascinating .
can i be honest ?
the farm is incredible .
what did they do ?
robert gupta .
that &apos;s the system .
that &apos;s about it .
yeah , good day .
lento , slowly .
all i &apos;m interested in .
we can do that .
what do you say ?
not very sustainable .
yes , milliseconds .
this is our present .
they have similar principles .
yeah , good day .
good work ! yes !
just do your job .
this was the result .
thank you very much .
and she did .
so they meet al .
it &apos;s essential .
they &apos;re all important .
very different term .
immensely exciting .
that &apos;s me even .
it &apos;s diameter .
yes , that &apos;s going .
flying cats .
this is the last .
can we change it ?
these days are over .
these guys deserve money .
what &apos;s going on here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
they reused it .
and that &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know .
centers were built .
what &apos;s going on here ?
but you know what ?
what was the result ?
i was amazed .
it &apos;s generic .
so they knew everything .
you could see manhattan .
here &apos;s the video .
it has sensors .
why not live longer ?
he opens the door .
a few more .
that &apos;s very good .
oh , so , the one .
there &apos;s no normal .
yes , i know .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
but you know what ?
i have a question .
okay . thank you .
i stood in front of him .
players don &apos;t sit around .
so you can do that .
it &apos;s bad . &quot;
so let &apos;s see .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
what do these people need ?
i don &apos;t believe that .
i thought about it .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
they use their hands .
so how does this work ?
how interested they are .
that would have been okay .
what are media today ?
you can go in .
so where do we go ?
so it &apos;s true .
how do we know that ?
because you know what ?
it &apos;s not a country .
why do we do that ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
bg : thank you .
this is a wish .
and i was an artist .
let &apos;s call it .
not school management .
and that must go back .
we can do it differently .
they even do weh .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
an immense challenge .
there &apos;s no food .
it &apos;s against justice .
but the wrong things .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
i &apos;m a writer .
here &apos;s another example .
i meet children .
it feels great .
i swear it .
i wonder .
it &apos;s not going to do that .
thank you for listening .
why should we do that ?
thank you .
here &apos;s an example .
you see it immediately .
not toxic .
but i continued to work .
or against bombs .
i &apos;ll go in here .
there are two possibilities .
we need energy miracle .
why does this happen at all ?
oh . a moment .
i want to tell you .
what do you want to do ?
this is what happens to us today .
and i continued to work .
so she was back .
and that &apos;s how it was .
yes , here it is .
i agree completely .
and why is that ?
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what would all be done ?
i mean the soul .
you do the same thing .
in china , it was different .
fortunately , not , yes ?
but that &apos;s not protection .
pee &apos;s chance .
does anybody see anything ?
and i always had .
very expensive mobilization .
people toy crazy .
what creates the illusion ?
my construction feeling .
after only one journey there .
first , limits .
i created one .
yeah . well . all right .
imagine the camera .
jk : both of that .
but it &apos;s even worse .
here you see it now .
thank you very much .
be a mentor .
maybe 10 times .
but that didn &apos;t have it .
the data came in .
this is a great question .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
it has billions of them .
did you see these guys ?
but there &apos;s something else .
here &apos;s another example .
is it photography at all ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
ohhh .
and then it became international .
there were remixes .
let me summarize it .
okay , a few more .
the answer is no .
just keep going . lots of fun .
my name is amit .
he had the experience .
it keeps you fresh .
this is a great question .
is that your opinion ?
a almost identical structure .
and it got better .
that &apos;s what she did .
it &apos;s really loved him .
here you see the city .
good day , all together .
am i going to like the color ?
oh , thank you .
some have come and went .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s more .
dk : 60,000 .
there &apos;s an old study .
don &apos;t be discouraged .
the game is from 2007 .
that &apos;s not true of emotions .
he &apos;s called paul open .
so what do you believe ?
who &apos;s going to make it safer ?
first , we have the population .
i don &apos;t like that question .
but what &apos;s your fish ?
let &apos;s call him don &apos;t .
this is preceding .
the work of interpreted .
but where are we useful ?
they had no mass media .
how do we actually work ?
his own story invent .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
so , what does that mean ?
now , what does that mean ?
privacy has to be given his .
there are online criminals .
we have three main groups .
it was still fish .
he always showed up here .
and then it happened again .
i felt really good .
and many people forget this .
crisis . death . disaster .
it would be untested .
it &apos;s not our fight .
it &apos;s not our problem .
we &apos;ve lost touch .
why not think about it ?
we love technology and creativity .
it would be knowledge .
we &apos;re always pushing each other .
and this opens up a map .
but what do we do with that ?
that &apos;s about it .
what do i look at ?
his name is tempt .
is it my size ?
that sounds crazy , right ?
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
we need to spread the message .
that &apos;s what most of us know .
you also have to understand that .
you see that down there .
i want to ask you something .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and luckily , he didn &apos;t die .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was destroyed on the ground .
they look like this .
is it about light ?
i grew up in india .
that &apos;s the short-term .
you see the water coming .
i had a good life .
so what happened for years ?
who are those relatives ?
i wanted to keep us healthy .
these changes are in the world .
how about fitness ?
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
but the key is , ...
he works like this .
and then they put it up .
what &apos;s actually happening there ?
the orange tractor .
they really loved it .
but i felt bad .
the two greed me .
woman : outcomes technology .
very scary .
what &apos;s the soul ?
we &apos;re not producing ourselves anymore .
i can say anything .
he went up and down .
what else can we do ?
this is what the graphics looked like .
i &apos;m going to get to the end .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
it sounds perhaps jewish .
we were 20 people .
so we &apos;re too many .
you can &apos;t have bones .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
or is it possible ?
it comes from conflicts of creativity .
so what do we need to do ?
they didn &apos;t have books .
this is felix .
i actually made two mistakes .
thank you for your attention .
that was the beginning of the journey .
i &apos;m frightened .
and then everybody went down .
they saw the big impact .
first extension , second .
well , i was the next one .
frankly , who &apos;s normal ?
and finally , episode matters .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
the same thing , only bigger .
who &apos;s the most successful ?
you want to feed the world ?
i wanted to support them .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
i only loved two .
one place is south korea .
again , you &apos;ve got it again .
that &apos;s such a natural thing .
my wife told me .
and how did that feel ?
that &apos;s what you can train .
does it make you curious ?
so it &apos;s a circle .
so , why now hacks ?
this happened around christmas .
what &apos;s this thing ?
it &apos;s about , you know .
they could have done better .
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
i don &apos;t have to worry .
and that &apos;s not even anything .
is that reasonable ?
so that &apos;s the good news .
it was a huge success .
so they saw something magical .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
five to one , great .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
but it can &apos;t be a problem .
the ones always say , why ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
it wasn &apos;t invented yet .
now , as a result , it should work .
does anybody know what that is ?
for example , this perception in context .
this is a game for outside .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
but it was very sad .
so let me remind you .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
and it &apos;s the x .
sometimes i push too much .
but they do the job .
they connected those two people .
her mother moved on alone .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
think about your own decisions .
this image is from this place .
i see this plusb sign .
and it took 18 months .
tell me about this world .
this is very risky .
and that worked very well .
again , he showed him four .
i learned everything .
and there are hundreds of them .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there &apos;s good news .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
that made me really sad .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
but it &apos;s not so fast .
how can we help you ? &quot;
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
no , it was never been an opportunity .
the story is not over .
what happened that day ?
well , then we want to .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
they come from the artists .
i might not say that .
the power plant can explode .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
she did it for three years .
you can have these cloud .
the data was not available before .
play is not silly .
now , how could this happen ?
is that all education ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
so , that &apos;s what we can do .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
they have not changed the story .
everyone talks about happiness today .
don &apos;t taste very well .
play means not just child games .
and that was 19 years ago .
which one would you like most ?
they create a epic story .
they have so much uncertainty .
the data is constantly shining .
no one ever said that before .
so paul is a terrorist .
and that &apos;s what he actually says .
don &apos;t take it for granted .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what should our experience look like ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
i almost never do that .
she was back and die .
and of course , that &apos;s incredible .
and here &apos;s the attitude again .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
an autistic student .
when the waste is garbage .
so not like detox .
and that &apos;s all we &apos;re taking .
we depend on two countries .
everyone needs a goldfish glass .
let me give you his . &quot;
people were still happy .
it was my first sunset .
in fact , he gathered fish .
my name is brian goldman .
they share their experiences with others .
the white lines are for population .
that &apos;s why i made the movie .
he showed up on the algae .
it &apos;s just not technological .
there are four and a thousand people .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
and we &apos;re very happy about that .
every waste is nutritional .
and so we &apos;re too many .
so the question is : how ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and it was an incredible experience .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
but there are two problems with this .
i started feeling better .
but , you know what ?
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
that was grandios .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
we &apos;re in a field .
and that &apos;s what we did .
basically , they do the same thing .
this is now one of the images .
what other brands act like this ?
and then something weird happened .
they can play with different ways .
the whole building was out of water .
italy wins . yeah .
the morning , before the game .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
creativity had to be kind of out .
now everything is easy to have .
the nurse asked the nurse .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
maybe even in our cell phones .
and it starts with a doctor .
i &apos;m going to stand with you .
we use the energy of the sun .
this is all of the metadata .
because i can say anything .
it will always resemble you .
but slowly , it turns out .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
what are you trying to do ? &quot;
further than we don &apos;t go .
what lessons have we learned ?
and the shape plays a role .
you can &apos;t store energy .
then i can transmit that whole thing .
okay , that really makes sense .
once we started a vibrant .
my second mistake was worse .
and they beat a 257 .
we all love baseball , right ?
somehow , kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
that &apos;s about five meters long .
they become free in the computer .
because does anybody have masses here ?
and then reconcile it .
among other things shouldn &apos;t suffer .
this has the biggest impact .
the movement of writing it .
anyway , to navigate .
and that &apos;s pretty much in the beginning .
the truth is more like this .
do you want jeans ?
so you can &apos;t do anything .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
her family gathered up .
thank you for your patience .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
what else is risky ?
just be you , who you are .
i remember my first fire .
what is a story made of ?
dark ages . dark .
now , i tried something exciting .
but it &apos;s very effective , yes ?
but we need the whole thing .
nuclear missions , yes ?
this is completely tribal .
let &apos;s leave that quietly .
hmmm , my brand ?
that &apos;s scary .
that sounds scary .
next : nuclear energy .
also , a very exciting phenomenon .
i wanted to be very normal at the time .
i &apos;m going to show you now .
once the judge saw me .
we can &apos;t do that .
so i went to the court .
i got a bit scared of technology .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
and there are several reasons for this .
they sell certificate .
but it &apos;s not documented .
why did i go to medicine ?
it can know where we are .
it spreads rapidly .
all adults were aware of the risks .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i like things that are different .
i went to prison -- hard .
it didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
this is a car game , right ?
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
and this video is in real time .
the game starts -- swiss .
you can &apos;t have any teeth .
what about longevity ?
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
so the correlation is low .
so , look what happens .
and it really changed the dynamics .
so i just started playing .
and then we said , okay .
yes , these are the data .
i &apos;m shooting through my head .
were you even neither ?
that &apos;s like learning learning .
because for me , it means memory .
how and what does he feel ?
we say in germany .
so you can &apos;t solve this .
music is medicine . music changes us .
it turns out it &apos;s really difficult .
and you know what i learned ?
these are going to be unresistant .
but what &apos;s going to happen in the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
this has nothing to do with science .
and that can make a big difference .
but there &apos;s another reason .
anyway , we need a solution .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
so i &apos;ll stop , thank you very much .
they were flying the channels .
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
we started with this 15 years ago .
how far do you get there ?
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
you know what neither is ?
so the first step to a interpretation .
and it &apos;s still not a interpretation .
this has to be the age of aging .
if you come to that , yes ?
you can show me i was there .
this is just the minimum .
we can regain our nutrients .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
on the book and on the image .
this image reminded me of something .
i think they &apos;re abyss .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but it may not be the case .
and what does this mean for the designer ?
i want to prove to you that .
it was a pretty fate project .
here he leaves the sun .
this is the memory .
these rivers are taking their rivers .
a has these benefits and risks .
our newspapers are read by millions .
lego made it possible for everyone .
privacy doesn &apos;t stand to debate .
they were genetically engineered .
i &apos;m the redefined doctor .
i don &apos;t take the same lost .
baseball is full with great statistics .
because we live on a planet .
do we really want to go in this direction ?
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
and these are the neural structures .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
oh , my time is already over ?
something increases in me .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
so we measured his movement .
this is a picture of the object .
apparently , it was quite popular .
you see something funny here .
i really like beautiful clothes .
he can only use his eyes .
but the truth is far away .
you can do this all the time .
so this crazy story could be true .
who would ever wish to be one ?
the defeat would have been simple .
her father died shortly after her birth .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a cents .
we need to increase the complexity slowly .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
here &apos;s your martian gang gang .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
but then they really want deep inside .
you want to orient yourself in the museum ?
that was more concrete .
okay , you really want to know that ?
and i had to go out of the city .
we won some prizes .
who doesn &apos;t want to change the children ?
it makes light on kids .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
no , i mean it really serious .
i hold the knife in my hand .
and the goal is very simple .
i shoot my sleeve .
architects and engineers , for happiness .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
now i see greeks .
a billion people will like to be hungry today .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
i loved myself from this fish .
no , no , that &apos;s not going to go .
and this sounds very different from before .
he was already over sixth .
i created a institutional institute .
they even get funding with funding .
the film hasn &apos;t been delivered yet .
we need to think about what marrow is .
what do you do with that ? &quot;
i call this the radiant .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 since 1994 .
it &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
this is ideology , not science .
and this brought me through ...
today , 6.8 billion people live .
just , that &apos;s how it &apos;s going to come .
it &apos;s busy with sense .
the hot projects today .
automatically goes to the right thought .
that &apos;s how nature demonstrates things .
but it requires a lot of planning .
we can reinvent everything again .
as we think of north .
and it depends on phosphorus .
often , in the third , forgotten .
even longer than those other two networks .
the stones are colored .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
it &apos;s about changing values .
i started with my usual talk .
this is a very sensitive question .
i learned that from my grandmother .
now we do this with airplanes .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
we haven &apos;t written this app .
and every morning , i jump on this .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
these are more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
the gears are very good .
in words , what would you describe with ?
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
there are also worlds in the world .
now , what &apos;s the right thing ?
in the people about the urine .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
the living bears the violin .
they gave their blood pressure up .
thank you , but the best part comes .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of equilibrium .
happy productivity . fantastic !
the result of that was catastrophic .
and everyone in this room has to put it in .
here &apos;s the olive oil process .
bjoun &apos;s sundine .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
i think there &apos;s possibilities everywhere .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
we already have a lot of procedures .
this may be public .
my brother stared at me .
these are the apple saras .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
who could have looked at it ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who do you really want to inform with it ?
completely at a certain goal .
what do you think happened next ?
they have . they always have .
so this is a hard coat .
it &apos;s consistent by condense .
they literally hire the levers .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
especially when he died .
so it &apos;s two circles .
the side product is clean water .
this sounds essentially very unusual .
we built unique elements here .
you always lose rare animals .
it &apos;s going to touch it deeply .
he died , broken through the story .
here &apos;s how the building works .
they drilled each other .
say what you &apos;re feeling .
the other one had died through diarrhea .
let &apos;s do a little intermediate image .
here you have this little mechanism .
there he signed up .
the interest is interested in the firemen .
the question is , what &apos;s going to happen now ?
students are divided into notes .
these things are logical .
and here you feel it .
for energy , that &apos;s what i found .
i tried to understand them .
all those generations need only a few milliseconds .
and it seems like no one seems about it .
that i wrote these crazy things .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
this is just a little less destruction .
and the curiosity does not learn .
this is also a paradigm shift .
a dalmatiner , right .
you can see from the back to front .
so , from modern to computer society .
and that &apos;s what they do .
we have to come far , and fast .
it &apos;s about a neutral supply of america .
they &apos;re all inconvenient questions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they are the home countries of someone .
we &apos;re running through passage rituals .
now look at this curve .
wishes simply belong to our lives .
i suspect people in death cells .
they kept us from being inspired .
maybe some mutations are mutations .
so scott gets this frustrator .
we worked until late night .
so i followed my construction feeling .
he went back to the silence .
now we saw the reverse effect .
caves all applaud audiences .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
so ... so , not so optimistic .
he turned out to be the bumps .
let &apos;s start with the real perceive .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
they had a concept of blue blood .
i believed everyone could do that .
i never met him personally .
even cats look at this video .
there was jimmy kimmy drum .
let &apos;s think about atoms .
how would you describe your brand ?
we &apos;re talking about cows , fresh .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
no , that was what i thought .
i &apos;m a redundant person .
that &apos;s not the route .
this is a painting of a circle .
the roof was covered with water as well .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
and women argued the successful .
we can support them to be good .
look at what she &apos;s doing .
the main man came up to me .
sexual progression comes into the image .
i &apos;m going to read you the input .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
that &apos;s the truth . i believe it .
we &apos;re talking about twins of it .
it was really immensely profound .
he shaved his head , no .
this is going to happen in april next to april .
we also get very accurate data .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but with the right design , please .
we can support them to be good .
by saying , what is information ?
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
there was never a time before like this .
and even lomg thinks about it .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
and also , these sources are interrupted .
how will you feed the world ? &quot;
this is an ecologist network .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
the chef had injured him .
you make it like that box .
this is such a trawling part .
the thing that &apos;s just been represented is .
what does fifteen million-dollar seconds take ?
i see the dalmatiner .
it might take , until it &apos;s invited .
maybe again , there &apos;s a glimpse behind .
no , no , far missing .
and this image was taken by atlas .
156 nations send our tv channel .
they called their internet connection .
but today , we &apos;re far beyond what &apos;s going on .
she wasn &apos;t drunk .
i &apos;m a man . i make mistakes .
this is the system where we live .
but i was interested in these questions .
and that was what i felt .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
what will these three billion people bring in ?
you should give you the wishes .
something very strange happens here .
and that was the outbreak of that .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
it can know how we hold it .
so it creates a feedback loop .
boston is not just a joint center .
this is a modest little app .
this is from a different place .
&quot; they didn &apos;t get rid of it . &quot;
i lived in parallel worlds .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and i &apos;d like to read you the premise .
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
they can be logical and intuitive .
tell me a little bit about this part .
make it possible -- you all here .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
does anybody know what that is ?
so this is the reason for this project .
it &apos;s called &quot; i jump with me . &quot;
let me tell you a little bit about it .
these kinds of conditions don &apos;t exist in us .
we &apos;ll come back later to these guys .
we can give ourselves something like this .
so the first big primate .
and there &apos;s some sort of collaborative staff .
daniel kahman : sure .
everybody would like to make the people happier .
also , the domain plays a role .
and why ? intelligent food changed .
it &apos;s gray to millions of people .
we now have masses in this country .
not even the truth will be free .
because now you can apply a three-sentence .
you can see the timeline on the line .
in many cases , these people are totally healthy .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
thank you , danny kahman .
and we &apos;re going to get an absolutely flat line .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
because we don &apos;t want to shoot the gene ?
we don &apos;t want to have seed companies .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
they lead the process , they understand it .
there &apos;s some things that need to come together .
and what do you do with the waste ?
bad ? i was completely confused .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and then he can go away .
a nice story about how i mean .
his personal discussions of seerosion .
i &apos;m trying to do this for an unprecedented moment .
it has to work first as a present .
but we start to see a change .
this is a annual water river .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
now this level of intuition is going to be very important .
so little-like open source is open source .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
they grow up to five centimeters .
maybe i did it with good reason .
&quot; a whale blue dot . &quot;
let &apos;s take something else now .
it all comes from our own pockets .
normal people aren &apos;t accessible . &quot;
as an artist , the context is very important .
here you see roberto dance .
and no matter how italy won the end .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
but the game is a formal change .
thank you . i have a question for you .
he &apos;d had 20 minutes of music .
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
this is just an insurance method .
it should recontain the two elements .
shaking the environment , make less waste .
but i &apos;ll get to speak at that same time .
yeah . she doesn &apos;t do anything else as discoveries .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
a language is a expression of the human mind .
it was a acute barrier .
what you need is a new medical culture .
alone , complaints and without support .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
i think our identity is threatened .
many of my clients are very young .
my cousins all over the place .
we saw some amazing presentations .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
here are two different jewelry ones .
well , who &apos;s ready for that journey .
i have him here on my laptop . &quot;
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
a whole gray nightmare food .
the difference then is perceived as a loss .
in two hours , it builds up everywhere .
the emergency room pulled all the strands .
no insurance can create quest .
there &apos;s a lot of great books on this topic .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputer .
this country is different from 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
you can predict that . why is that ?
what kind of application do i take ?
it &apos;s great that these number goes up .
isn &apos;t half a quarter or a quarter ? &quot;
so what can we get out of all this ?
so basically a translation of translation .
no tree is carbon neutral .
and further , now you see it always .
the next step was now within these communities .
he had plenty of natural videos .
this is actually just the labor force .
two minutes later , three things happened simultaneously .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so , he &apos;s in here . right .
it really triggeres the fuel problem .
and ecologist was a catastrophe .
this is one , part of her .
it just didn &apos;t come before , you know ?
in other areas -- the world of communication .
this is my supermarket . no big one .
but western governments are also helping themselves .
sleep lack is ubiquitous .
i &apos;m getting tired of how we all .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
if you burn coal , no .
say , there &apos;s no prediction .
can you play it now in blue ?
no , we figure out what &apos;s in there .
and there &apos;s a central point here .
it &apos;s just because everyone &apos;s eaten .
that &apos;s the norm of the norm .
what are actually archaic models ?
and the list can continue .
so , that was my primary motivation .
providing america . they find more .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we asked him , and nobody knew it .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
monday : color is something more powerful .
it &apos;s kind of served us at some point .
and then it looks like this .
do you remember the winds ?
so , help me a little bit .
imagine mozart &apos;s efficient .
i &apos;m happy that i &apos;m there .
the water quantities have expanded .
they make it worse for us to stand there .
man 3 : i &apos;m the guy &apos;s museum .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a license .
in between , the instruments have evolved .
i want to just explain to you a little bit about this .
actually , a viral video didn &apos;t want to make viral video .
in this three-sentence , three sentences come in .
you know three sentence , you &apos;re still from school .
you can zoom out very easily and zoom in .
now i add a bass .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
if not , jellyfish today are somebody else .
this is the machine underneath the genesis .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
she laughs more than her here .
their problem is they have too little .
third , escalation of expectations .
the official dogma of what ?
you just listen , and then you start talking .
let me show you how they work .
it &apos;s a game called follow .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
we &apos;re thinking about energy today .
that &apos;s what it is . thank you .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
you go around and you get yourself .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
imagine a plane full of smoke as well .
this is something that &apos;s built in the city .
second time . end of the normal play time .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
imagine that just for a moment .
raise your hands . let me see you .
maybe we can see drill as a change .
dumb , it &apos;s not much better .
people suffered . people fought .
and let them start with an example .
you know that science is not a company .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so , that really caught me .
i tried to preserve the body .
life hasn &apos;t changed since centuries .
but so many people got over the years .
my grandmother never forgotten me to forget his life .
my fourth technology : predicting complexity .
the third technology : categorization .
it &apos;s helpless a thousand square miles .
you get to two because -- very simple .
you should tell me a little bit about my brand .
it was something that we knew .
but reality is always unpredictable .
the summer was a fortune summer -- 2006 .
donnerdy : confidence is the key .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
i wanted to restore health after a disease .
now , if you think about a piece of data .
what ? that really left me out .
we live genetic food waste .
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
we &apos;ve forced them . puff .
my parents are the 80 on the ferrings .
and there &apos;s the warmth problem .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
we talk about &quot; drink in information . &quot;
they can jump directly to a certain output .
you can dive into a specific year .
because that &apos;s why , right ?
shaking the environment , uses less energy .
this is something called the osit-model model .
now you see the dalmatiner .
and the two final ones are also here today .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
this has to go all the way down , zero .
but i didn &apos;t leave myself alone .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
and in time , they can react to other people .
our goal was to say , okay .
and yes , i &apos;ll go back again .
all of this is compostible of it .
it &apos;s all in the world , it &apos;s useful .
this will happen in china in a second .
the phosphorus problem is much critic .
anyway , they do that in the middle of it .
the permanent ice is labeled with red .
and if not , dance is still your dance .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
my mother asked us to embrace her hand .
seriously , the underground . go .
well , this cartoon does a few things .
here &apos;s some on the hampton .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
i thought i could integrate myself .
we &apos;re still thinking , you &apos;re originally .
the three words noisy : do you remember ?
i remember when it was yesterday .
here &apos;s the chance to do something .
well , i cheat the courts .
i said , &quot; ok , oma . &quot;
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition .
i work in the solar energy industry .
and let me show you a simple example .
but it has an unexpected twist .
so that made sense , it was appropriate together .
still , we seem to be quite happy with this .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
scott submerged from man to human .
and here &apos;s a very well-intended piece .
it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
is it about the details or the colors ?
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
no one has to give ideas to ideas .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
i think i might have heard more hands .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
eeee ! no , thank you .
and this is a million-dollar concert .
so at this point , we need digital security systems .
so again , the appropriate really good together .
the internet and it &apos;s a miracle .
interiors come in many different forms .
so let them go ; they save the shoes .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
what we want to do is create the future .
i &apos;m not in real life of this feedback .
there &apos;s a lot of fortune coaching .
let me show you something close to me .
it &apos;s like a potatoes .
commend . commend .
we &apos;ve gotten rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
they were just like the people in this room .
my grandparents put these numbers at 70 .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
we need to work for more research .
there &apos;s every footprint there .
i would normally take the needle out now .
there &apos;s somebody sitting in the back , who had no childhood .
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
let &apos;s do this as if we had a machine .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
this is going to be a key element of this belief .
they live with help from chemosynthesis .
i was completely thrilled , you know .
now i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
and every night they fly 240 kilometers .
every morning they fly 240 kilometers to farm .
what is the fugee ? &quot;
natural light provides smartphones .
that &apos;s not what any of the world has done .
picasso says , wait .
we always create new tensions and conflicts .
that the theme of ecology is a global .
now i &apos;m going to do a little bit more heady .
they &apos;re all back to their way back .
and they had to remove what we did .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we just signed up .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
so you can &apos;t put them in the wrong way .
what do you do with certificate ?
this is alfred gonzalez .
there can be a sequence of changes .
and this is very important in medical research .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
what would you say to somebody who believes that ?
then he whispered me into the ear .
the rest of the time are occurrences .
i start with some simple examples .
we always tried to ask significant questions .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
the question is , why people accept that .
and i got back to work .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silicon .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
then i wonder : how could that happen ?
first of all , i thought this was a game .
the storytelling always needs more senses .
and trying to do this again with another generation .
today , a lot of people have given the government .
next week , the market comes to the market .
she &apos;s got a button , at / .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
thank you very much for behavioral economics .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the performance .
the first is a classic apple , apple .
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
these things have a positive effect .
no one wanted to do something about the movie .
what do you think the answer will be ?
on the left , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s why i think we need to be leaders .
so we have this horrible idea .
so two pairs , each baby is a baby .
ladies and gentlemen , their relatives .
it &apos;s the test of survival and success .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
it was awesome beyond the imagination .
the best part is coming -- in a second .
so each concert is a different concert .
so not saving , distributed , avoid .
and everything is packaging or content .
i could go right in front of my house . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
they &apos;re supporting other people &apos;s mistakes .
i put it , and i got interested in treatment .
you know how to call a 4,000-squatter ?
notice two things about this curve .
and i have to say , it gave me power .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
at 16 , i started to illustrate books .
that our contribution to the system is choose .
there had to be another piece of empty piece .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
he &apos;s not out in other countries .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
i never want to know a little bit more about life .
so i spoke at a conference a few months later .
this is how they communicate -- this is how their fingers walk .
i want to show you something very first here .
and of course , it has done it , but click .
it was summer , and i had sticks .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
and they &apos;re not only going to die of masses .
what happened is we could do that .
they don &apos;t invest in power stations .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . i put up .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
anyway . that &apos;s what i want to do every case .
technically , it &apos;s the same .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for nine .
i lifted him in this particular way .
at the beginning of the tribal society through the language .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
so she &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to the people .
we don &apos;t invent identity ; we invent it .
it was a lot of time , and i was in iron .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that briefly for you .
now everybody &apos;s trying to figure out something out of this pattern .
he came to me and hugged me .
all of them were like this , started sharing .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
i &apos;m really sorry . does that make you crazy ?
the country would roll over the country .
so smartest , a huge topic everywhere .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
we want to do something against death penalty companies .
there &apos;s a couple of very interesting developments .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet it &apos;s a realistic level .
so , the theme of the day : money saving .
in fact , no , that was not the mistake at all .
and what i say now is very important .
and we need to improve much better at this device .
it happened four and a half years ago in italy .
and i claim that that &apos;s good .
this is a problem that many players have .
the last three of the five i summarized .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
memory those slides , solves the rest .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
well , what &apos;s the brand ?
i want to help you calm down .
both of them are exaggerated , both of them .
as i said , amanda does our elephant .
there were no canadiou-like signs .
have you taken every morning your vitamins ?
so this was a highly strange experience .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
we have 20 percent in germany already .
all of these windmills are close to almost .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
the only thing they had was their head .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
this is a dead turtle turtle .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
i have something that i want to show you here .
how would it be longer to live with good health ?
we don &apos;t want companies to patent companies .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
they &apos;ve reversed the flow of the water .
so , we can &apos;t wear these things .
in the countries where people get to money .
and how does it actually look like this ?
we understood that the weather is global .
and in this head , the memory was going down .
you saw it in the news .
this is a totally unsustainable development pattern .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
everybody in my manhattan &apos;s neighborhood is gone .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
well , would you choose the same vacation ?
there seems to be a disagreement .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
we did it in the last 1,000 years .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
now they understand the advantage of &quot; prototyping . &quot;
that &apos;s the u.s. for hundreds of years .
i think the first place is curiosity .
the flgos eat the shrimp .
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
but maybe you can still agree it .
but today we only talk about the biological systems .
it &apos;s not to be compotent , of course .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
and we see that it &apos;s gone through .
because it doesn &apos;t feel real money .
yeah , so what should biohacking be ?
here are some people who test it .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
there are ones that are much more spatial .
the corporate headquarters is right here .
one of the things i thought he was kidney .
and feedback to my top doctor .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones as well .
we want the number of chiefs .
the swiss is concrete .
the dna of dna was an interesting step .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
but what happens to &quot; limit &quot; is different .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the label .
no apple ever looked like this again .
good night , sweet rats . &quot;
now he &apos;s making a tractor in the scene .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and their movements .
if your job is dance , dance .
so we complained about 50 of the magnet .
these are footage about a threshold of six seconds .
but netherlands is not always such a bad thing .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
they &apos;re going to be rare because we start them .
so you don &apos;t often lose preventing the animals .
all of these are inevitable .
we have access to exponential technology .
i remember when it was yesterday .
and i &apos;m going to get a character in the book .
tell , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
so every trunk was slightly different .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
i hired my job at 95 .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
we found that it &apos;s really weird .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
the answer is likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
this is something like our champion .
so that they can pull the whole movement away .
here are the results that we &apos;ve just gotten .
but how do you do that in practice ?
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
i want to do it by not getting stars . &quot;
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
this is the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
this is not about how happy a person lives .
and they ask : what happens to those moments ?
... also , the dose has a role to play .
probably a lot of you know about this trick here in the room .
yeah , they &apos;re right . we fix that .
and i &apos;ve got all kinds of little props here .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
well , i understand that . that &apos;s what i do .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
let &apos;s think about how to measure our success .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
these blocks are not bringing us money .
i can flip the sequence as it moves .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
for nathaniel , music means secondary health .
well , then we have a business model .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
because actually , this human being is not interested in evidence .
because we can &apos;t live without those liars .
he just fails them , and not to himself .
why do i have to afford so small car ?
a phrase with his own breath .
you can &apos;t talk about interpretation of the beginnings in the beginnings .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
it &apos;s sort of an act of morphology .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say that .
or they didn &apos;t have any photo tography .
and that leads us to one big question .
it &apos;s virtual reality , and it &apos;s not really computers .
yeah , what kind of projects do we do now ?
and the world we lived like this .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
if you generalize it , that &apos;s what happens .
and this was not a hard way to diagnose diagnosis .
i was a forced obsession student .
all right , really good , maybe a single star .
wealth , not debt , influenced the result .
she had the last word in every family history .
the transition happens . we can all feel it .
and we use this word with such digestive .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and that worked . applause for scott .
i met the decision to move into the u.s .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
in 2010 , 23 million times had been looked at .
and that was an experience in dehumility for me .
and finally , we should be transparency .
this is just online -- no press , no tv .
or are they more of a downtown ?
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
so what are we going to see in the movie ?
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
i want to tell you how we found that .
and this is the planning process behind stuxnet .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
each ice berg has its own individual personality .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
look , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
it &apos;s natasha , and it &apos;s only natasha .
we have the passion of a poet innovators .
this is moore &apos;s law &apos;s last hundred years .
thank you for at ted . thank you very much .
we want to create mass tirels . &quot;
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
now we do this with drills and machines .
this is the call center for service and information .
and we want to take this to a world level .
we all have navigation systems in our cars .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
all right , let me show you something more of that .
here we were , and this is the painting .
emc says , &quot; you &apos;re welcome transparency . &quot;
there was a lot of crazy things going on there .
from the aviation to the machine age .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same with disabled movement .
but are we going to make the best of our toy ?
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
so we have 1.5 billion player .
you expect an extra billion player in the next decade .
but one of them is much worse than the other .
but you know what they don &apos;t have right ?
i thought , let &apos;s take the poker-like use .
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
and so i then met a slightly unusual decision .
so my two passions were kind of drawn .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
i don &apos;t know who you know about this image .
i can only agree , that &apos;s logical .
it seems to me that it &apos;s important to lose one .
the question of death penalty is an interesting question .
the child in me is really thrilled .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
al is a hydrant in boston .
today i &apos;m going to tell you about unexpected discoveries .
the underwater part comes from a rock .
when i say reality , i mean photo reality .
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
and how did this happen ? what did it succeed ?
a little bit more about them , not them .
it was &quot; in eternity , always . &quot;
tuesday : adaptability is totally overrated .
the dog ! i was a linguistic word .
would you like to become more attractive and more conscious ?
she harrosed barely , and she was blue .
the people in the side of the room come in .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and some of it didn &apos;t work , and some people didn &apos;t .
so we &apos;re running away , and where are we going ?
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
we wanted to develop a learning tool for language learning .
i may have another 40 years of work in me .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
if you want to make hyperlinks between the images .
and so it &apos;s not perceived as a great loss .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , small idea .
that &apos;s the kind of teacher richer .
now , luckily , there &apos;s a whole bunch of studies .
and we learn trust and the rules of play .
probably one of those numbers must be close to zero .
and i said , &quot; yes , very much . &quot;
you can say things here , the world has influence .
... could you just show the slide for a second ?
same , i think , let &apos;s play a games today .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the aid doctor .
and i went over and i just heard .
it also shows other places of the book .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
another favorite image of me , starvation night .
these results were reached by several weeks of hard work .
this player &apos;s about to be in front of a episode .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going to happen ? &quot;
there &apos;s a program that some might know .
i &apos;m very grateful for the scale here .
you know , he was 35 here .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of that yet .
my mother litt was dream of the boat from the boat .
these are the people who form my world view .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the bordal anymore .
we see this in all sorts of possible areas of human life .
and it was then after the three months .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent pool .
the main problem here is as similar as aids .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter about reality .
there &apos;s a nice concrete example .
then i say , heartbreak , yeah ?
and we &apos;re often reinventing ourselves as we want .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing kids to the world .
his closest work has changed after that .
i said , &quot; promising , oma . &quot;
it &apos;s amplified and weird programs .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
but what this image says is a problem .
there are some places we can turn to .
we called it the digital water pacon .
because they have special skills of processing skills .
so here are some natural light bulbs .
the second factor is the service we use .
it changed my way of making movies completely .
it &apos;s hard to overrate the destruction .
so you could probably feel to sell him .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
that means that ants weigh much more than us .
and we can look at that now .
gee and jellyfish cows .
so , pull it off and start inventing it .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
imagine only two other small changes .
how many would choose to choose a good memory ?
and that &apos;s the message of the message .
so please hear , if a music is played .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter what &apos;s wrong .
the first two sentences that are logical .
actually , we know that something else is different .
now this is not supposed to be a joke , but it was .
do that once again , and then you learn the sentence .
we can take these things to different examples .
what we love is love , is the nature of discovery .
they moved to a natural concept .
so these women met , and they just came up with them .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and we created an ipad app .
darwinian and sponsors became healthy .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzles .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you zoom in . you can actually go in .
you can see in all these mulakes here .
how much money does it take to realize that ?
think about it . this attack is generic .
and when it doesn &apos;t , it doesn &apos;t matter .
so we start with a wind-drone drug .
he says , &quot; willingness to make up space . &quot;
imagine a soundscape airplane .
it &apos;s a completely denial of miserable .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
this is another look at the tree of life .
they divided the kingdom into two .
this is one of the classical expressions of play .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
we had no child paralysis in this country yesterday .
and i used a while to figure that out .
we repeated those practice with the same students .
you have to be willing to take risks like this .
&quot; look at your panels , pink .
there &apos;s no overpopulation growth of trees .
then you &apos;ll notice that it has given a change .
and the third area that explained actually from itself .
i &apos;m happy to talk to all of you .
every big picture is the beginning of a triangle .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and they know what ?
or are they rather like a down-tribe ?
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to ask ourselves .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
wednesday : you are your inner child .
play is the kitchest that keeps us .
if you have something to say , you &apos;re going to do it now .
how would you like to be better than you are at the moment ?
they teach them to open up themselves .
antarctica : healthy , powerful , powerful . &quot;
and here are two patients . these are their records .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
i think that &apos;s true for every human being on the planet .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
so , a climate change will be terrible for you .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website here .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
but the volume are much bigger than ever before .
it grows in the winter and rubble in the summer .
not just bad , but the worst of all times .
everybody knew their genius was something lam .
we repaired them , repaired them .
and the world that we now look like this .
but these are all roads in the u.s.a .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
child mortality has reduced to a 10-dignity .
that &apos;s also there , that &apos;s coming back .
ok , this is something that a half billion people eat .
it &apos;s not an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
we &apos;re going to walk into the poor placebo industry .
in nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
where is the biggest interest , what is really going on ?
also , the energy source for them is very important .
we went back to the tick of titanic .
because artists have a local ratio to lie .
and at all , you test a lot less than me .
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
i &apos;m never going to play more like this one right now .
it &apos;s the form of reform , yes ?
and less usable or usable friendship is .
how can i do something usable ?
i don &apos;t see a reason why this shouldn &apos;t be .
so how do we work if we look inside ?
every society is driven by a primary medium .
and these interactive portraits occur to each other .
we &apos;re focused now on greenhouse gases of the fourth generation .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built the watermarks .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
they get a model that comes out of the whole earth .
the grandfather of this old man germans .
and she said the three words : remember you ?
the only problem with that was that she had 10 children .
so in other words , i definitely want to do what i want .
and i see the same process in combining photos .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it was looked at this year almost 200 million times .
they had 348 different kinds of marians .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with that .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember that .
he described one of them as very ordinary .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
one thing is that the screen is filled with leaves .
so the percolate movement has done it .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
this year , it almost looked at 50 million times .
but what about that day , that particular friday ?
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
we should put the bear in the cage .
are you an eight-hand money-seven ?
the living self doesn &apos;t have voice in this election .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
and in the world , everything made a sense of me .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
dane , in a moment of head .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
and no , it &apos;s not an altitude or san francisco .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open doors ?
here &apos;s the current version of this entry .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
and that was sort of the first of the people of developed toys .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
you never get a task you can &apos;t solve .
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen flat lines .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
and the movie is called &quot; the morality of science . &quot;
well , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
we &apos;re talking here -- about 15,000 lines .
how would you change your relationships and how the negative energy in it ?
well , we introduced the mayor hole .
well , today , we know all about where our things come from .
france makes a rich . italy makes a tor .
how do you divide people because of their characters ?
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressive viability .
he stays five beetles from my consciousness .
is it money for others or is it possible ?
so i say , let &apos;s start the world changing games .
edward caova is a volcanic scientist .
we currently spend three billion hours a week playing online .
the biggest difference between you is the transition with time .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
bg : a energy breakthrough is the most important .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t shake you yourself .
with pivot , you can dive into a decade .
but for many people , that &apos;s a little bit radical .
so i was running a lot of fish in my life .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
in reality , the notes are very , very uncertain .
because we don &apos;t do things anymore .
that &apos;s where it &apos;s going to be more like my glasses .
as i said , thousands of endeavor has just begun .
this is an interactive filmmaker .
and it &apos;s like old-fashioned ! just for you .
i &apos;m still going to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and everyone knew it worked like this , right ?
i would continue to do this work that i love .
and the question is , are they good news or bad news ?
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
here &apos;s your fingers on every light .
the next step was to find the apps for it .
we know another one where all the stakes are .
so you just go to google projet.com .
what other metamorphoans have they run through ?
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
you don &apos;t have to spend too much money looking great .
this constant feedback is not in real life .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
a research upside down to the topic of interface design .
i &apos;m also going to resolve up what &apos;s in there .
you don &apos;t know anything in this goldfish glass . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great dunes .
in the future , most crime will play online .
we had no words for what we started there .
now he &apos;s standing on the red list of endangered species .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
but i really believe that after us , something is still coming .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
the cell communities began to abstract information .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital physical one .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacines .
&quot; don &apos;t &quot; recommend it as untrue .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the brick .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together .
also urban designers and construction are very interested .
there &apos;s not even online . there &apos;s no stretching .
it doesn &apos;t work at all for memory itself .
our steps in the digitization of life were exponentially exponentially .
this is starry night , probably never seen before .
and i learned a lot about this discovery journey over the course of discovery .
as a child , i was always drawing comic books and so on .
when we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
that &apos;s now a test where our goal is .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things like that .
we were there just as much as we could .
a lot of talk about 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
i was quite obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
so when sound says , there &apos;s no soul .
this , by the way , is the most difficult part in my talk .
i can &apos;t play like play in 20 years today .
both accidents put me , fracking me up .
so much testosterone , but no reaction to that .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my axes .
1m is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
a manhattan project project ? how do we get to the goal ?
that &apos;s how to think about how to think about it .
these are spaces that can respond to intelligent people .
now , how do people die in such a hack ?
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
i sold rocks in the whole country , around the world .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can turn that around .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
no , the throw away is exactly the right , yes ?
many of you are covered by faces and so on .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
in both cases , operated and it was fine .
she didn &apos;t have a treatable brain damage .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
and the fish also had the fortune to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
it was the missing cross-section against drugs .
this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
there &apos;s more left behind , it &apos;s more profound .
but we only know a little bit about where the things go .
ok , imagine how extreme self-motivated .
i know what people think when you see that .
ask questions , ask evidence , demand your desire .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
as it used to be , it was happening in the village .
this is what the gene machine age is .
there &apos;s a political translation in our country .
they put them on the beatles machine .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental disagreement .
it could happen within a time learning ratio .
... the crowdsource of crowdsourced .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
i worked in a coal-fired mini work -- dangerous .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there he was crushed , and he said , right ?
that means to go back to the crime .
so , as a human being goes with certain things .
and , of course , as design contains the perception .
but it &apos;s a disaster for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
lawyer : i &apos;m a lawyer .
we have a abstract abstract language .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
but actually , it was a much more fun one night .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
it became automatically called &quot; automatically . &quot;
inotar is a certificate place .
well , because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to honor ?
he took a famous photo . what was it like ?
they slow down for our big problems .
we see the process that feed itself .
guess what ? yes . living ? yale .
here &apos;s a short video about what we &apos;re doing .
but you can combine something special like this .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
because the images are eating it for them to recommend .
you know , and whales , you &apos;re in this museum .
the idea is to move a digital security system .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i &apos;ll explain it .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy progress .
that wasn &apos;t a movie , no hd , that was real .
i wasn &apos;t there a long time ago with miguel .
because you know , that &apos;s a funny process .
have you ever seen a clineutral tree ?
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i just described .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
providing america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
frog , the carbon man is going to clean up every day .
this is a organism that we described in 1996 .
so i &apos;m going to step back and see the other way .
i filmed in war areas -- difficult and dangerous .
so we should find better at figuring out what the goal is .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
when we make cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
in other words , play is our adaptation .
can you imagine something good that comes from taboo ?
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
they were asked to cover all 60 seconds of their pain .
you can just call a few names , and people will understand .
diphy , rose , car , child paralysis .
this is a varied thing that was made .
well , the energy source is over time .
and there was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
it created immensely jewelry in the control room .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a pig .
it &apos;s this figure , it &apos;s injured .
the shrimp eat the physical lankton .
and so he &apos;s flying his queues .
and then there &apos;s a whole lot of simulations .
however , it wasn &apos;t like that in the last few years .
the musical child is the extension of our body .
he lived only three and a half thousand years .
hey , puma , does it really make you serious ?
a baby needs about six thousand wind .
so i know some of the ones that didn &apos;t carry up .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here to here .
it &apos;s like asking someone to hit the sun .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s going on here .
this is an idiotic debate . she has to stop .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
&quot; well , these are about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
bruno giusi : thank you very much . thank you .
i have a friend who &apos;s driving a passeri .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound pete .
and because we &apos;re getting older , the wind gets bigger .
this is the period where you fall in love with the time .
and today we &apos;re still very , very strong stories .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and the predictions , as you read , are serious .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
and i don &apos;t expect that &apos;s going to change .
it &apos;s also my great , life-long love and fascination .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
why do they advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
they have to admit that this is a big choice .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
a few years ago , i started to develop livelihood .
the brows still describe them as untouched .
my grandfather was during the hibition in prison .
she was a sunfish , strong woman , she had effect .
so , in some sense , mammals translate us to technology .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
but what if you want to see the paintings ?
but my logical side also didn &apos;t like it .
i just want to say a little bit about salad rescue .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . heart wish .
we also brought livelihood to design schools .
this is the simulation of the chesapeake bay .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to prepare against injustice .
my uncle died of alcohol diseases .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
in fact , we &apos;re also a majority of these root community .
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
let &apos;s call the animal fins , it costs a lot of money .
when a neighbor helps other people , we strengthen our communities .
ohhhh , wowwww !
they always worry that they &apos;re losing galleries .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and my talk today is mostly about these cognitive biases .
well , i do play with you sometimes , but not very often .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
open the map , and jump with a click .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a lot about transparency .
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
you could also use ordinary design -- technology to spread .
one of my friends made it -- richard boller .
now , imagine this image could really start to fly .
i &apos;d like to go and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
these are the kinds of questions we need to be approached .
i was fascinated by the elephant and beauty of biology .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
and this is from an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
i mean , how much zealination we do from our memories ?
the more money you earn is the more money you earn .
that our survival with the survival of every single one is connected .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
and yes , i have a task , as you might see .
second , combined photos had the same lighting type .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
for example , these would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
yes , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be made out of that .
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of statement .
and the film is going to be called &quot; the discoveries of it . &quot;
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
it &apos;s just that i think it &apos;s more like it , it &apos;s not true .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
i hope you enjoy it . thank you very much .
but it turns out that this is not all .
i mean , we wonder , why do we fight this ?
these are many deaths from masses , 20 minutes per hour .
so there should be a nine in the beginning of my death .
because they &apos;re the ones who are also taste for taste .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
i mentioned this to miguel and he kidney .
so the painter , the better the system . &quot;
and then i immediately think that &apos;s an unfair thing .
and also , what you would think today in the mind today .
and the oil is going to replace by other energy systems .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t know .
like algae -- and other horrible things .
i &apos;m not going to tell you it because i want to use it .
it was completely excluded that it could fail .
so this really took me off , and i wanted to get more .
and instantly , i see another pattern that &apos;s coming up .
yes , this is one down there , this is the burden .
that &apos;s why not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
we &apos;ve been using it in holland now for three years .
and if possible , i will find some of the strange things .
i now know it was the bottom of the ocean .
and that was the first time i learned this .
i studied woman and she was in breathing .
and the time that i collected more and more knowledge .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 , when a sleeper hits 300 .
in 2010 , we had just connected two billion people online .
i tried to say something about our personal system .
and the illuminates the way through the rest of the book .
&quot; because they &apos;ve been holding it for tomorrow , &quot; he said .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropy .
this approach is all for new things we &apos;re doing creative .
since that time , we &apos;ve received all sorts of recognition .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone in this audience .
well , your living self will not be happier .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re always lost .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
here &apos;s a picture of a orangutan in kentucky .
he &apos;s got a formulation from 15 to one .
i can say the kanzler is a man .
we &apos;ve moved before in the way called aviation age .
this is 20 feet altitude , like greenland .
this is the audience that we just finished recently .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
but you can do , if you look into a foreign foreign foreign .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
and all of a sudden he didn &apos;t seem to be much longer .
that &apos;s the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
or you want to be more powerful , stronger , more force .
and i don &apos;t just succeed , even though that belongs to it .
my great-grandparents died when they were 60 .
now , where should we go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
that &apos;s sort of like all of you in the preceding phase .
and of course , it can never be in germany . &quot;
one government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
and the more i talked , the more i should tell you .
and i celebrate , i wine like a little child .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit anything in my tiny suitcase .
if you &apos;re happy , you put other people happy .
players in spite of spiders are poets in spiders .
how can we transfer those feelings of play into reality ?
that &apos;s how the same , bad team under the best .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worried .
that &apos;s how people really thought about creativity in the west for a long time .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
one result was that the telephone was never broken .
the depending on his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
a few months ago , and i had just forgotten everything .
even someone who kills someone is not just a murder .
the invention of the language was a little step in this direction .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
and this video was actually already in january of january .
each one of those topics , of course , has lots of smaller decisions .
there are many other ones , but i &apos;m missing the time .
today , i want to tell you about circles and openings .
they &apos;re interacting with their surroundings and their experiences .
that trick can lead you to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
you know , there were no mandarin the paradise .
yes , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
all in life is beautiful , is not efficient .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting about vision .
i apologize to say that i must be so shortcut .
secondly , what economists call percussions .
and i think that &apos;s what the world looks like .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
so it has nothing changed , and yet it has changed everything .
we just passed the 7-billion-dollar brand .
then let &apos;s inject this analogy into the future .
so , if you can do the light again .
it was a store that was called dragon .
are you too far ? you can see a little bit of nervous .
and when i turn around , the fingers change his position .
the things that are used only are going to be used in technical systems .
so the device that you see is not working .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean coal technology .
they did it by making the country irrigation .
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
please welcome the fear . please welcome the risk .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
there &apos;s only the second best , the firemen .
they can throw away where they &apos;re going and stand .
an amazing error . one of nine innocent .
so i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually going to be a rolling iceberg .
this is somebody who &apos;s safe in the rest of the 10 .
we used to get used to the fact that things are linear .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black boys than mandela .
they &apos;re in , they want to go to the end of the gangs .
and then people could eat this , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
because that &apos;s where the actual government work is happening .
&quot; five 2.5 ? what &apos;s your feet ? &quot;
and then we started negotiating insulating .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
i play explaining what that sounds might mean .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re helping with , they &apos;re asking for the people .
but also , our perception of ourselves as they deceive us .
and another example is the ambient , intelligent systems .
how many doors have the house in which they live ?
we think it &apos;s clean -- and also smells well .
i believe in this , and i feel that we should teach .
and i guess many of you have done that .
some people were disappointed that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
i sent them home without talking to my top doctor .
the cost of solar power in the last year was 50 percent .
we need to engage in the machine age of the government .
there &apos;s a direct spinal cord for this .
the monkey of software takes place in the rule of a few years .
and sure enough , we can find fast foods .
cats look at cats looking at this video .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed a experts .
looks pretty much like old-fashioned mode .
i just wished to see my kids growing up .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
it has moments of life , one after the other .
and i was talking to you , funding a expedition .
we &apos;re talking about the fluctuation of information flow .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering collective .
that &apos;s already done in the first year half of his job .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
so they &apos;re moving around and making art installations like this .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
i was shocked , and i was crushed to the inside .
i went home with the emergency division on my way home .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
i say that because i think identity is very important .
because all these new technologies today are moving from themselves .
because their lives depended on whether they did the job .
and these guys know something that we lost from the eyes .
i knew she had come to abandon her .
today we don &apos;t just find gene on something we do with .
a typical walmart provides 100,000 products today .
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
i mean , this is just what my logical side says .
so what i &apos;m just telling you is what &apos;s truly amazing .
for example , the first example , it was about finding details .
he said he didn &apos;t ask that . he &apos;ll ask .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought in .
if they didn &apos;t move anymore , they buried .
wouldn &apos;t you like to make these changes in your genes ?
what would you like to have if you only have one ?
again , what potential we want to call , because now ?
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready to play for our own episode .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
when we looked at how emotion is related to income .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
there was no christmas trees . we did it all .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is micro .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
the one of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
the words , as long as his friends , were now bothered by his .
and we found that in fact , there was a context .
you know , how many decisions do you do about a typical day ?
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
so the driving force behind is the cybercriminals -- superpower .
i was no longer striking with my wife for two years .
the pilot went to the hudson river .
the revelation is , death is part of life .
that keeps us at the distance and makes us move further and further .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
it &apos;s about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
you can see the person who &apos;s wondering what &apos;s going on inside .
in most of my activities , i have two hives .
it turns out that dna synthetic synthetic is very difficult .
we know that money is very important , targets are very important .
we think about our future as a predictable memory .
well , the memory itself is a storyteller .
what it ruined was the memories of the experience .
we &apos;re going to meet in the next few days .
there &apos;s a incremental license there .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
a fish up , but also an avian reserve .
this second fish , which is a different kind of love story .
the first one , that was more like a passionate monkey .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he deceived it .
because the music is a language , and a language is communicate to communicate .
and first of all , first of all , to ask , what is the right thing .
but so far , i &apos;ll do it just a little bit curious .
i started thinking , i should just start the project .
we can , of course , first of all , look at the problem .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of platform here .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take it away .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
just to pretend precision of time , they &apos;re overwhelmed .
if the museum gave us the picture , click on it .
so you can ask : how happy is the living self ?
most of them are completely ignored by the memory itself .
don &apos;t please tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
has a single person in the audience ever seen anyone in masses ?
it turns out , whether you can get this to zero .
you can test it after my talk in your immune system .
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum , completely different ideas .
and she asked him , what &apos;s your hobbies ?
so again , in any store , you can get the things back .
so the question is , how do we go with these windmills ?
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
so , for example , shining the environment , less car .
and the lives lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
so if i put them next to each other , you &apos;ll be interested in this .
i think of it as if i could just write a song ?
she said it was like a donnell of air .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
they add a blue one to a green , and they can make light .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition goes very quickly .
yet , we &apos;re still on the galapagos islands .
more people came in and just because they were angry .
it was the fear of terror that their lives .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
we have a lot of cells that are no longer involved in itself .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
and what &apos;s below that is what we call office .
but where would the next aed be to help this patient ?
they have to make 62 different decisions to design their car completely .
well , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t that easy .
almost as if we were prepared for our lives .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego room .
i was the only one who could talk to the airport .
so the records were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
think of this as a dot , as a flying point .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
this is a fascinating adventure on which you &apos;re going to go .
it &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the coming years .
we found that in terms of happiness in life itself .
they fall in their urine . they do almost never .
usually most people are starting to orient themselves to the task .
you &apos;ve got to imagine the enormous challenges you &apos;ve got to imagine .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize .
if you walk , destroyed every footprint .
if we do it , we can go back a little bit .
the most powerful miner workers is the head of massage .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
there &apos;s a magic amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a email book .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be even worse .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
because through marine reserves , we &apos;re basically putting the past back .
i want to conclude with a story that really excited me .
sometimes i lift the equilibrium . a story to the end .
i found that technology should be able to do magic and not kill .
so we &apos;ve got the time scaling up .
so today evolution can happen in time period of microseconds .
this is a rare glimpse .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
we could reduce this , of course , 10 percent , but what does that do ?
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
car colors , outside the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
they don &apos;t even come out of the museums .
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
i became part of the miracle , not to die this day .
it &apos;s called eyeyebrows , and you can see the description .
this is the average size of a greenland iceberg .
i mean , what does anybody do with so many outcomes ?
and as a general term , we can use the word internal sexuality .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
we all have to believe last things that we can &apos;t see .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , it &apos;s called miguel .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to do first .
and then the same thing happens in a good , good conversation .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
we take pictures of these mini-crashes all in detectors .
economists call this a partisan improvements .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what gives us modern progress .
the way to maximize is to maximize .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
this is a whole book , an example of non-verbal data .
and of course , we all share the same adaptation .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in the fence of content .
there are cases of us , like the ones of inotrar .
let me conclude with three of my own words : i remember .
innovation , creativity , creativity and development is not just coming out of our heads .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
ceos are a little over average . but this is where it &apos;s going to be interesting .
because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concern .
here &apos;s a proof evidence that men are not pigs .
this deputy ran over to the older black hole .
but i don &apos;t know how empire people will be .
you &apos;re walking around the block , and it &apos;s like the revelation .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back into the room .
bonobos are combined with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
the first of these drops is a contradiction of complexity .
they invest a lot of their time in the collapse of growing structures .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little it &apos;s going to support .
normally you &apos;re just danger and some people don &apos;t come .
now he mentioned the mineral needs from physical lankton .
i take the breathing of the audience , consciously or unconscious .
they feel that &apos;s the actual truth behind the foreign .
but the question i want to throw up is , why not ?
and the best part of this is possibly what &apos;s in health .
this is technology supported innovation that is today .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so difficult , so painful .
wr want to help people who were convicted .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
how did he get to look for this particular kind of help ?
let &apos;s jump quickly to moma , again in new york .
tempt is going to be part of the show , which is quite rigid .
we &apos;re producing androds , and we &apos;re talking about androids .
and when you do it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this is scandalotas , and we should be ashamed .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple practice .
but while they were talking to different people of this world about these possibilities .
the ones today have a renewable energy of fifteen percent .
and they &apos;ve done this with what &apos;s called lead-maps .
but the key is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so i &apos;ve been busy doing what is , of course , intuitive .
and these are just the biohacker , the individual people .
it means that we &apos;re reaching a cultural impact next to the scientific .
this struck me when i wanted my jeans .
he invited the king from sideways to dinner .
but somehow we can do it from this problem .
and that &apos;s also what i had in the last year .
but instead of getting into panic , he just stopped .
how about tears that we can &apos;t even predict ?
if you look at the people who you have to do it ...
and guess what we found in the attacking code ?
imagine that every single person is controlled by people .
okay , let me squeeze a little bit of blood for you .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficient .
new investments to create good job jobs .
six : social decline . speakers seven : 65 toes .
and i hope you &apos;re going to play with me like this and play .
that means that the player is safe to do 10 times .
a long time ago , there were gray whales -- 500 years ago .
in many , they &apos;re going to say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
the x-ratio interpretation of a piece is this comparable .
from my eye angle , i looked at the janitors and off .
i found light bulbs in a glass jar all the time .
this image , for example , has about 10 billion dots , i think .
so i decided when i was 15 , to be diving .
here &apos;s a bigger thing . we &apos;re looking right here at the center .
and within a few years , lego went into every household .
the judge sees him as adults , but i see a child .
by the way , i haven &apos;t learned this in my work as a lawyer .
and i want to show you my outcomes for this week .
56 percent of all rapture don &apos;t come in front of us .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-assembly .
i asked him how to become a fishing experts like this .
there was the nuclear research facilitators .
this time talks about an anecdote that you might know .
it &apos;s not necessary to sing a limb or sing or sing .
and six-milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon of the phenomenon .
this goes back to a lot , in the cultures of the industrial times .
so , i think it &apos;s a very scary hack .
i think it &apos;s kind of like setup shore or something like that .
this actually has only taken a thousand really basic shape , these networks .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
so , this looks like a basketball plate .
and , if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i haven &apos;t left me .
well , in fact , the number of nonviolent crimes didn &apos;t change very much .
i ate him first in a restaurant in southern spain .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity &apos;s humanity .
it was always so inspiring , so refugee .
the death penalty in america is defined by irritans .
turned the tight ticket on the side . went home .
alone this airport has a surface of 100 square miles .
i like things that are weird . i like special things .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
so maybe you want to put them in front of a little bit about this . &quot;
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leaders .
here you see an excerpt from this attack -- code .
we &apos;ve got his bed so he can see outside .
we tend to have a man who has a value for our society .
we use games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust the system .
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to the question : it &apos;s .
the secret is that the game of the key to these skills is skills .
this is actually the true formulation of human and machine .
a few . probably as many as there are creative people here .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
they produced the highest construction in the lowest time .
in the average , it &apos;s about five tons of tons of everyone on the planet .
i grew up with a higher portion of science fiction .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building subsiv , not intense .
so here was finally a company trying to do it right .
the component is always going to be more like the friend you live with .
and i &apos;m not so sure that they really stay off .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little flight flight .
there was , in my opinion , a really good code .
in fact , nasa has shown that there are many of them out there .
they like to increase the paralysis and to satisfy the happiness .
now , i wondered , how can i actually get this over ?
it &apos;s an independent area . you control all the minerals .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view .
someone was broken , and had the system started hacking .
photographs like this : a building ground along a lot of vehicles .
the biggest fear they had pipeline , rape and death .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very difficult for all of these extensions to come .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange landing street .
but let &apos;s see , it &apos;s a very good medications .
i brought seven down to seven of them , and that &apos;s all .
but a lot of people are caught in a very strange position .
our gut is a wonderful hole-friendly environment for these bacteria .
well , the two species of self drives two terms of happiness .
well , life itself lives to be continuous .
there &apos;s a massive wave of happiness under research .
it &apos;s just a cold calories . it &apos;s mimics .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
ah , the majority . i like to see that as a doctor .
my inspiration comes from a event that comes back 500 years .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
now , what does this have to do with placebo effect ?
the smallpox . the smallpox people killed on this planet .
it &apos;s the renewable energy that they &apos;re often called .
this is a fish up in the south western corner .
so i ask , how does competent have this diagnosis ?
the notes have the function of a letter .
then , the interconnectedness of the pre-industrial cultures .
that is , you navigate about sound and rhythm .
so this is just a application of many you can do with it .
and then we worked out such a comast .
on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to lhc .
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
this is what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
54 percent of the death penalty cases through drills .
basically , the concrete construction became the stone of our time .
how about a new set of new ones , never before .
how can a judge someone turn something that he &apos;s not ?
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lynmobs .
so programs that can sore on the former numbers of numbers .
for example , the fish was taken on a glue trip .
the possibilities that were not allowed would have been explicitly encouraged .
so i was doing this a few years ago to do exactly that .
finally , when we &apos;re supposed to be called the fear of welcome .
an eight-hand , vert marke . how &apos;s your brand ?
why is it important to start out ? what represents the red ?
so we created a device that &apos;s completely limited .
and i was like , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
well , in this night , everybody went to celebrate the center .
and the key indicator of this is the extinction of languages .
and i had to explain to the journalist that there is not this test .
and this is called androgen-receptor defect .
we &apos;re developing a common denial , heart-to-heart creature .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
at the moment , they are in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
and soon , i wrote an article about genetic food .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
so i offered a 10,000-dollar prize software for the winners .
one day , this mirror , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
there was no piano at the time as an instrument .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
even if you were to shoot now , you would have emissions .
most people know that most people know this from the software industry .
this is actually live on the internet . you can check it out .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nunavs .
but nothing was invented , that would let me go back again , until now .
and the best part is that they connect with magnet .
some of my claims happened in the last five years .
i looked into the rack , and it was a little bit pink .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular tons .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
so the dramatic numbers are coming to prison in prison .
i spent some talks in germany about death penalty .
a child in india says , &quot; today i saw a monkey . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
this is my long orphanage . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
what &apos;s the relationship about the thoughts and feelings of themselves ?
and when the dangerous ones are , things can happen really bad .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
if we don &apos;t take a phosphorus and give it away .
this piece of 50 year-old technology became the most magical thing for me .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours a video is uploaded .
if you could do it for the ones , you could also help me .
and just like that , all these companies disappeared , one after another .
i &apos;m sad that we never know each other as adults .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserve to .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
and so when we think about it , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individual capitalism .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go to the house .
if you only have one of them , it would be a completely different world .
specialized skills and processes and their combination of success .
people here have a lot of the development of this wonder .
and somehow we need to create changes that will cause zero .
we &apos;re still going to find other weird features of what their rights are .
that &apos;s the period of most perceptions that we have .
this is our youngest tastor on the bottom right there .
at the end of march markets , the lhc will be functional .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
you know how to call a 3,000-pound baseball ?
i believe that in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
when someone lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
and so i believe that the ted community should be a horse .
and she &apos;s spreading , of course , organic , organic .
my friends from honduras asked me to say , thank you ted .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
well , finally , the film has a very big deal to get up .
it &apos;s actually just a period of two and a half / two weeks .
these guys are connected to the movie in eternity -- always for .
so all these green areas , these are the most scalable environments .
one is called jazz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; peace . &quot;
so unfortunately , we have a piece of god too far .
i went to the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
in the short period of time , one of the ted is that ted has an identity .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good intuition to actually extend the experiments .
my opinion has changed mass tirels in the world .
this is all reality today , and in the future , much more will be possible .
so that allows us to play the combination of binary , trust and to each other .
here &apos;s what it says , the more you brush , the better .
people said , do you have no fear to succeed ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding me , but i can live with it .
and what i learned is that mistakes are completely disparate .
i love these : &quot; watson contains human enemies . &quot;
i looked at them and smiled , but she looked very serious .
three months later , i moved around and went down the adventure .
it &apos;s about creating scarce flow .
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gray sounds and such a stuff .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to you back to tony .
we want to use this as a possible impulse for flyles .
and the question was , how could you connect technology to connect new technology ?
for example , i don &apos;t want to give you a fish like a human rights .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
and that &apos;s something that we need to learn , and that &apos;s very quickly .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s concern .
the human being is supposed to have a common ancestor a common ancestor .
and loud and light , f and b , cetera .
how were his circumstances of living things like society and politics ?
on september 10th , last year , the machine went to the first time .
we have little-sized children , and they &apos;re distributed to play with it .
and when i heard her , she made kew sounds .
and i was good , i went out with claude .
but if i ask you , how do you deal with your wife ?
you collectively collecting information about the piece in the seknee literature .
there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they can all engage with each other .
but how would it be if the image linked you to all your images ?
you say you never die of the names .
but it does something that doesn &apos;t do any other regional technology .
because the categories tell me how i can hold them apart .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
we should be able to eradicate everything we want .
and i tend to see wishes as my shadows .
so , in a way , studies have been done to see if this was the right thing .
and then you can see the enormous speed of gaps there .
it comes from nature to asia , in the case of japan .
because a good engineer has either made great cars or nuclear power plants .
and that was the very first beginning of a musical expression .
you can only have llegic missions if you &apos;re not there .
you &apos;re fine . the question is , how will we go ?
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
the official favor of all western industrialized societies .
&quot; do you remember the patient who you were home ? &quot;
we live on a planet at 70 percent with water .
just dive the housing of housing against the cities .
because that &apos;s how to lie that these logic simply can go wrong .
often the music class is so that you learn to read the notes .
that &apos;s just the letters that you learned to paint .
eight : tsunami warning . 9 / 11 : cyberattacks
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
bruno guisi : mark , mark , come back .
just when it doesn &apos;t seem that easy to play , maybe the most tiest .

and after that , when i was thinking about it , i decided to let negative energy out of my life .
now you might assume that the whole collapse of catcategories would actually make me happy .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have bodies , the social norms in question .
and it &apos;s fundamental to us , and it &apos;s fundamental to the attachment of relationships and the care of tolerance .
they help with the digestive nutritional nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
these are our master-player . 500 million people who are extraordinary in something .
you &apos;ve probably heard of the level of the level , and you &apos;ve heard a strength , or you &apos;ve got one to do it .
that &apos;s going to be , i think , in the next one or two decades , part of the national statistics .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not a specialist meat .
when paul talks in a public phone , he can &apos;t say a truck without a truck .
but this article made me worried , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i found it out .
because the phosphorus is given to the pigs one over the most feminine parts .
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve chosen the ocean as we &apos;ve begun to have .
think about this : we have a 4-letter code : a , c , g and t .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i &apos;m sorry .
and the color of paint and shattering , you may remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
it &apos;s probably the smallest app of the 21 apps written in the last year .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they are so much more value than to build it .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says everything is connected to everything .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is often mentioned today .
this can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .
if you turn on the light , it looks like this . so just like we saw it before .
imagine that the screen could just appear in different formats or bigger , in different solutions .
so i started thinking about what it is to do in these games .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to attack the needle .
and what the marshmallow effect is doing , it helps them identify hidden .
they do that because they can follow the striking white line of the country 992 .
i &apos;m convinced that somehow you &apos;re kind of moved to nostalgia , and you &apos;re kind of crashed .
and what we can now read in the daytime newspaper that you find in this third sentence .
for example , one of them has a very different area . monet has painted the seal pellets .
and i want to leave you with protol that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
that was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi 174 .
but interesting is the unique pitch of the song , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order of the information in which this information is represented .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true today that less is less .
i thought , &quot; look at the camera &quot; would mean that we wanted a back conversation .
so for example , the number four 164 sticks out of this code ; you can &apos;t see it .
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just so that architecture disappeared almost .
when these dots fall down , they can write on it , they can show patterns , images , text .
our cities became , in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
for bonobos and people , you know , life is not counting and cleaning .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this rotated stuff , like manifesto .
to become part of the constitution , but it has to be twice by congress .
you put an executive administrative team on the team , you get better .
bill gross has several companies , including another one called olar , who has great solar technologies .
one is the energy editor that creates these technologies dramatically more dramatically than the power of power .
that means that 15 pounds are needed to get a pound tuna .
we just wanted to know what happened , because with a normal , regular electrochemical battery .
a tv or a washing machine that they use , you know , they don &apos;t need it .
in a certain sense , the arctic application is the battle of our global climate system .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to believe , the fish knows something .
and that was an example of how our own governments use technology to us , citizens , citizens .
we want to defeat genomes and discrimination in the criminal justice system .
this creates a kind of social network around digital collection of photos that you actually took .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
and what we actually did , we , the humanity , is we started to abstract .
this is because the government is like a ocean , and politics are the top 10 inches .
at the end of one day , i cook a giant top soup that we shared .
something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice , how this slide is supposed to be .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , so long as you &apos;re not a particle physicist .
either &quot; flesh &quot; or &quot; a paradise winds , &quot; you will have the choice .
you can &apos;t just emphasize enough of how critical this factor can be for the quality of a human being .
by shooting the sidewalks and putting them together , he can interact with the characters .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there were no men in their treatment .
it came to me as though we were sending our ubs and dreaming of dreaming of them .
how can we keep them longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times frozen .
and the side effects of android gene , which are vicious hormone hormones .
i was the second volunteer of the brand , so i had pretty good channels .
and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution are slowly slow , but they &apos;re uncomfortable .
players love to become part of the root of the missions of the missions of the planetary outer .
so what we have here is a full generation of young people who are master-player .
you know , there are two countries that control almost seven percent of the phosphorus benefits worldwide .
in china , it &apos;s called a neighbor today &apos;s honey , kind of like , yes ?
it actually took some years to start with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
and the preparation was enormous . we had to build cameras and stones and see all sorts of things .
but what &apos;s interesting about voodoo is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
because obviously , an animal that was very often very , very rarely before it dies .
and sometimes when there &apos;s something about ted , it gets a meaning and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have .
you have to make the sound of the winds , you turn them off and read the rest of the book .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen here .
they &apos;re not fighting this battle that we &apos;re all fighting to speak , who &apos;s allowed to speak ; they &apos;re all talking .
you might think that &apos;s just a landing image , and the bottom part has been manipulated .
and the next piece of the puzzle is four women in three generations building a new life .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right , but you know what ?
just to give you a glimpse , i zoom out so you can see what you get .
and as part of that , they made us a concept of anatomical common dense .
or are we going to be something else -- something that may even be adapted to the environment ?
i really hope that we play significant games to survive on this planet another century .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing to be cold , and to decrease ourselves that it can afford .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress .
the idea here , obviously , is not just the machine officers in the control room .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- i &apos;m really checked out of the socks .
these gray boxes don &apos;t walk with wind software ; they base on a completely different technology .
well , when i was a nice college , i had my first bike curse .
and that &apos;s half of all the water problems around the world that are caused by the textile industry .
this is almost full of complete security -- perhaps for the fish , definitely for us .
in this country , we have children &apos;s lifetime of life support without punishment .
here it is necessary to understand what we &apos;re understanding under correctness , always to bring back .
we need to prevent the people from long things , especially when they &apos;re true .
that i just do it differently and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better hands-on .
now , reproductive officers all the rest of the people who have the numbers at best .
his mother was chased as a punishment for -- to be prosperity .
they sort of figure out how to find their time to find english and italy .
2 : famine rejection in somalia . three : fat spray spray of the police .
but not true , we have seven percent in europe , and our net is physically seen the european .
so , i write children for children , and i &apos;m probably most of america &apos;s children &apos;s children &apos;s children &apos;s book .
the next piece of the puzzle shows how a boat is running in the early morning &apos;s red light .
this sounds very space-time and sounds very much like science fiction , i know .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;ll ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
so , i think it &apos;s going to be or the jewelry , fishery , fishery , a part of our future .
both of these are strong fuel , because we don &apos;t really look at the problem as we should .
on the new day , they go -- woman , a woman , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
also , despite your logarithmic course , it &apos;s going on the left-hand side .
michael j. nelson , the mystery of the mystery theater was one of the first ones to make a joke about this .
so with this , we also want to understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , simple trick .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees celsius , they can survive there .
so , in the way , the shift of the burden of the burden is what you experience is the magnitude of the lie .
already today , in some flat bottle , alaska &apos;s methane of itself .
for her life , she had a job : the fluctuations of her family and a new life in australia .
and in reality , when we fail , when we reject on obstacles , we often feel different .
to this archaic model , we heard that we have a principle of natural relationship to virtuality .
as a child , i had collectors of sticks , stones and butts and cheeses .
and so for the interest in this technology , this technology , i &apos;m just moved on .
for example , we &apos;ve developed a ice ice package , which is at room temperature .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not in open bach , but maybe you can help the france for a little bit .
in high school , a student said that brian goldberg was going to learn a flower for a flower .
i &apos;m going to be on a statistics of the statistics that i hope most of you have heard .
so when we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and like a lot of people , i thought it was mostly about choosing people .
so it &apos;s all the tools , and the only thing that mimimics us is our imagination .
if someone asked them to describe their brand identity , their brand joints , how would they be ?
so basically , i &apos;m like , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then it can do it .
because the lesson that i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
and maybe we don &apos;t know where we are cut when we &apos;re actually checked .
a third sentence , which immediately appears to be people who have a strong sense of soul .
it &apos;s called the old-fashioned law , or the old-growth psychology that actually affects us in perception .
this is a whole series of things you &apos;re looking at right next to the actual dot .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability , virtual skill than to accept a real space .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
i can accelerate the whole sequence by putting the pace into one direction or another .
and this question was so simple that we decided to explore the answer to the answer , and the work of the work .
we say , &quot; computers , generic please save a hundred million units of instructions .
they make methods that are easy to use , and they start with these patients in the team .
and i think the most important point is that we &apos;ve stopped talking to our patients .
so maybe we &apos;ll sell a shoe and he &apos;ll be the greatest shoe you &apos;ve ever wore ...
why not have the fast muscle fibers that will allow you to run faster and longer ?
we know that as human beings , when we work , we work out hard , significant work .
we know from that study that you have to reach out to the needle when it &apos;s to go to the thing .
i brought you an example from the north american rabbit of the nomad india .
maybe an aging understanding about the relationship between humans and the mystery of the creative part .
we have now almost an infinite choice of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve reached in the last century so that we can predict the development .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privileged , fearlessly , before adhd .
so we could just end up with dumb , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
when i went back 27 years later , the fish was dropped to half its size .
well , morgan , the name of transparency , which is exactly what happened to the 7100 dollars ?
it &apos;s almost no physiologically impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing light bulbs .
do we use these decisions to form a society that &apos;s better than the successful , the friendly one ?
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change your cells ?
this also provides the conversations of this talk , which is why i hope you &apos;ve loved it .
but in fact , my research institute at the institute for the future is just the opposite .
nothing moves in my sleeve or comes out , no trickster . and you can study it all .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics that made me not have any fancy fants at all .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of mammoth , often known as &quot; migrant reactor . &quot;
i remembered my last year when i brought mosquitos and somehow people liked this .
what matters for the old ones that have most of the first semester , the great old-growth laws .
40 percent of all people in the world get half of their drinking water from this melting water .
that &apos;s great . the tubes didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a special individual .
the viral particles were released by the cells and came back and killed , ecoli .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed that point for a long time when our choice improves .
well , you can see , on all cases , no one has to be a slower candidate .
most of the mass content in this country didn &apos;t really find really in the class of the violent crimes .
this endgame is going to promote money in more sectors and safety .
police officer came in and made a treasure treaties and offices .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write by hand .
so to me , it seemed like to be about going to be the right place at the right time .
and that sadness really formed in a thought , which is that i just wish for one thing .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since his , as i have to say , very successful leadership .
you don &apos;t sit around and flip around . there &apos;s always something important to do .
our memory tells us stories , which means that what we remember from our experiences is a story .
do you say there &apos;s an impact that has to do with clouds that different things ?
that &apos;s sort of the deadline that we &apos;re looking at , the environmental models that we need to keep in .
and also , though -- it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need a fuel -- you have some parts .
you didn &apos;t realize that they &apos;re not going to bite . they &apos;re actually not going to leave the glass .
and so many people come and look at this because you can see which problems you get .
she heard about this book from charles darwin , the origin of species and the tribe of the people .
i adverted my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , oma , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
evolution is all beyond the genome of the next generation , adapting and survival after generation .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital just -- just great -- except for my physicist .
well , if i ever opened the elder with the 600 images in it , i would have spent another hour .
people would think in their faith , and that &apos;s how you can &apos;t free them .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design shop .
there &apos;s a liquid guy that seems to be difficult , but maybe they tell us about us .
here we see this again again again , again , again , again , this whole , single aggregate .
now , interacting with the object , again , can zoom in , zoom in .
first of all , al banal , but it &apos;s very exciting when you &apos;re getting too busy .
because a lot of people , they can &apos;t make use of it , so anybody can deal with it .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of a mixture of scores and boggles .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace it , it will be a huge challenge .
if you break the goldfish glass , it &apos;s all possible , it sends the happiness .
if i take a room -- like now , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking about me .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to court and wear this crazy case .
it was recently done a study of ceos in which they saw a week for ceos .
so we survive our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t matter that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
i got another gift , which is to see the future , and come back and live differently .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
so we have the memory self and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
unfortunately , that &apos;s the whole good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they &apos;re often mentioned .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much of our energy without changing his lifestyle .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got two years later when we moved to california .
so , for the learning process , you need the music process of music at least as long as the spoken language .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put these little pieces together and correct the mistakes .
we &apos;ve managed to get it to about a hundred genes of the 500 or so here .
and this really drives these ideas to create these constraints of constraints on the screen .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species may have existed for 600,000 years .
because in this context , we start to understand the real amazing things that make us extinct .
we &apos;ve developed a app for layar , expanded reality to find these aeds .
there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m going to tell you about , by the way , that &apos;s going to work .
we &apos;re using this great euphemism , trying to figure out what makes you meaningless .
i &apos;m probably going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that have happened since the beginning .
so if you &apos;re lucky enough to do the two ways of maximizing yourself , you will end up doing very different things .
as peter told us , it wasn &apos;t just the highest doors , but also the most interesting structures of all .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have any correction .
we hope that this is not a pop-ups and other nonprofit -- that should not be necessary .
the grandfather of man was not afraid of the arctic night or the weather .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones have been produced or 75 rocks for each person on this planet .
and to win , this has to diagnose a better diagnosis than a team of high-qualified doctors .
the founders were from my view of the original anatomic activists , and that &apos;s why .
they played a cumulative game and the victims to break off a episode .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are the success of scientific method .
it would have been without the outrageous requirement of space , but the power is much more important .
i certainly would never meet an alien world with a spaceship , and it seemed quite unlikely to me .
we &apos;re not going to answer it immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
well , just to conclude , i want to notice that i talked a lot about the fathers .
who knows , when the movie comes out , maybe we look like a hormone volumes .
what are we going to start with the fact that we &apos;re just going to tell you about a few nucleotides ?
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then increase my strength and excerpt .
but if you &apos;re in an episode of your adventure and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to get the oil out . &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would never have won before there with human potential .
and that &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids will die again , because that &apos;s just one question .
in the rich world , there are millions of us who are only threatened by a generation , barely .
here &apos;s a very fundamental service . are there at home so that you can read the homework ?
the greeks called this divine divector of creativity .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch them go to the next century .
and we install an evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going on in the microsetup .
so in other words , the future has shrunk every year for me since i &apos;m on this world .
they shoot the choice -- they shoot themselves , even when it comes to their own self-interest .
so these kinds of things -- you know , people remind you -- this is kind of , why we &apos;re interested in .
if you surround yourself with the right people , you will not only understand , you will appreciate it .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said that they were doing this model .
a method that &apos;s particularly interesting , and what i used in the last few times is the evolution of evolution .
we had last year a team of rows in boston to program the code for america .
so , imagine you were at the same time in multiple places , how would that feel ?
obviously it &apos;s with a virus very simple . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
so the nerve cells are the information processing system that built these cell communities .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital head with the rotorial in .
eaaca , a little anxioxious , which helps you get on the wheel .
no , the gap that i &apos;m talking about , that has to do with it , that it fails itself .
when professors become curious , they &apos;re often shrinking them up in such a research semester .
this is the machine age of machine age , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s the book , and it &apos;s the photo tography .
and it &apos;s about solving a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and we think that we &apos;re going to be the first ones with the fuel of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
it turns out that it actually meant to be , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do anything about their movie . &quot;
in the moment , it was like a film director would have given a bug .
that &apos;s how if i were to say , your child , it &apos;s just three times a half .
and the main lesson that we think we &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
but there &apos;s no verb where we can look around , where you learn how to make fire .
it &apos;s to write the piece , it &apos;s getting more and more and more to my personal , to play it .
but these concepts of cyberage that will allow us to rediscover these opportunities back again .
so these elaborate people survive longer , and they multiply in size .
so just these words that we also have in the language of politically correct correctly .
the first example is to predict what many of you know and some of you , very few of you who don &apos;t need at all .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could do a , or we could do b .
i want to talk to you about this mechanism today a little bit or something that &apos;s unfamiliar with you .
so now i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite images , serious workers from tea breeze .
but now it &apos;s coming : if you have to have evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
in open bach , for example , the garbage is 20 percent of the waste between windmills .
but again and again , very rare , something special happened . one of the darkness was actually overwhelmed .
my heart &apos;s heart , i was a joke while i was trying to figure out what was going on .
the human part of this book , of course , is , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in .
immediately , you &apos;re going to be able to find one for those of you who have predicted , you can &apos;t prove that .
they &apos;ve reformed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that &apos;s changed at a time will have changed a lot of biology .
and because you &apos;re obsessed with your mind , how can you feel damage ?
for these non-engineers , little-gled material was another material , electronics was just another material .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the community ?
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that &apos;s indian , but also very timely .
and every time it divided , the ones in it have to distribute infected chemicals at the same time .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a realistic result .
so i wanted to create something different , something that starts when the process starts out .
and when you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you &apos;re pushing out to the extent .
yet my interest in photography , when i received my first digital camera , at age 15 .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 parts of the way you know it from documentary .
i spent a lot of my life trying to be , i &apos;m trying to be myself , and at the same time .
but not only that -- so that melts and they connect with the universe and other devices out there .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the major problems of the world .
there are so confined things like this whole genetic shift in plants .
if any of those who had built a five-inches of construction , he would have contributed the price to home .
i met mr in the 2008 , two years ago , in walt disney hall .
and yes , the discussion goes around the question as far as you can take a piece of the future .
every year , we lose three million tons of phosphorus , who really should go back into circles .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated as though i was going to be teaching .
they can go in and create their own museum -- from all these pictures , they can put their own collection .
so , in the big and all of us , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have what the goal is .
well , a light bulb is usually something that you find because you dropped it somewhere .
so the idea is that we actually include people with , where they together , collective .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the head of the development department of a nonprofit organization called rome .
it &apos;s about how happy or enjoying the person who is , when that person thinks about their lives .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and stay here .
they lie , they shrink , they &apos;re confused , they &apos;re really drunk .
because the ground is going to die , the moose will die and the wind and the water will wash off the ground .
so that you &apos;re going to be able to put citizens in the position , you &apos;re going to deal with these scientific technologies .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you &apos;re looking at .
this is one of the images that we &apos;ve found with the so-called gapixel-technology .
now , since the film was film at the sundance festival , we can look at this .
and every time i interviewed somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
pollinators are born as a calf of a glacier , or break out of ice sheets .
so in this project , we actually designed some small marker to track the garbage during the system .
our language is the social changes that have been solved in many cases by a technological change .
but danny , in the entire american &apos;s pursuit of life , freedom that &apos;s pursuing for happiness .
i know we can do it , and as far as it is something that needs the world now .
about a decade ago , i wrote a paper about vaccine for the new yorker , a little article .
so the performance is to work with prototypes -- but let &apos;s see how the teams act .
and , even though it really seems simple , it &apos;s actually really hard to do , because people are very quickly working very quickly .
there are very , very few things that you can say , of which there is a chance in a million .
and it occurred to me how this very profound sechment , one of the world &apos;s dream mission .
that was the movement . it was the legislation . it was the business plan of the american agriculture .
if i come , with my little icon and my little piel , and i &apos;m just wrong , this feeling comes up .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
we made small pieces , we made a missing correction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
they found a paper with false thought , and they could feel the creator of these thoughts .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the flow of how nobody could have predicted it .
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , oma . i promise it . &quot;
i &apos;ve tried to make clear how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and it seemed to have something like this , with these gray boxes , these real-time systems .
and you &apos;re all going to give them all nutrients that they might want to be able to do without any effort .
if there &apos;s a spirit of these qualities , we can create a new reality and create new insights .
maybe that &apos;s exactly the sense of wishing , a perception of iteration , a feeling of our own power .
the challenge provides a shared experience , a common language . basic position to build the right prototype .
if you have 10 teams that go typical , you get about six , you have stable structures .
and there &apos;s certainly unclear about how bad these are going to be . but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
if we can do this , then this biscue data , maybe a new source of information becomes more meaningful .
this is really important because this is an insight that is not in an individual peasant .
in holland , of course , you understand that easier , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .

but tomorrow , for us to ask the challenges that we can -- think about climate change or climate change -- as we can then change from the digital physical world .
as i do that , i &apos;m also going to give you some of the lessons that i believe you or don &apos;t have learned from those abuses , nothing new .
it demands that we all build our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking , how our feelings and our feelings do , in the challenge that lies us .

well , with all our digital devices that we have seven days , 24 hours a day , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not a wonder that we &apos;re pessimist .
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why -- maybe most of the electronic health projects are missing : because we &apos;ve heard about it .
i had to make sure it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my task to learn that history was trying to express us , we were missing it .

it &apos;s not just &quot; code for rocket science , &quot; there are hundreds of people all over the country who are standing up and write government apps every day in their own communities .

that means that if we look at existing models from one another , for example , the metaphor , i can take the tongue as switch .
so , very , very exciting processes , which then in this one , yes , gray is not actually , but right here in this novel , this raw mass .

so what i want to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested on different types and different kinds of research places -- which you can just apply to your business .
so if we keep thinking about these things , then the obvious answer would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t sound me because i &apos;m a braver citizen .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , i went to the hospital and went to the parking lot to go home with the car when i did something that i didn &apos;t do otherwise .

and my nose always stuck in a book , a science fiction book , which led my thoughts to other worlds , and in narrative , my deep , curious curiosity .
years ago , when i went to study a graduate student , one of my graduate students , who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked as a feminist , as a feminist -- a really big question .

many aging societies , including the greeks and the rocks and the tube , really believe that language has a huge force , because what you &apos;re talking about can also manipulate itself .
and when these tools become more physicist and a consciousness for their movements , they recognize each other and perceive the enemies of our real life , then we can start with the research of new research and entertainment .

now , if i look at all these guys , i realize that the majority of them are officials , some of them come from science , some of them come from less , from the economy . here &apos;s my chef . and one comes from the music .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been studying now for a few years of biohacking , and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve started , because i just wanted to know , and i wanted to do it in front of you , which i learned so in the study around theoretical table .
and i left the medical school with the impression that , if i knew everything about it , and i knew everything , or at least as much as possible , as close as i can , that i can make an immense against it .
and then when i go one step further into these interfaces , where i live per voice by language , by language , by the way , and by no longer the mouse and the cursor has to control things , i &apos;m even faster and faster .
that means , i actually now , you know , in the middle of this thing , that you don &apos;t see more patterns in the middle of it , but i cut them off , in a short period of time , in this dog &apos;s image .
because at the moment , where i turn my hand off from you , so you can see from the back , this finger , my finger , just from there , where it was a position where it was in the exact same way .
not to burn the enlightenment a little bit better to burn it , and to lose it in the burning facility , to lose all the materials for circles , but first of all , to ask , how do you make it ?
the first thing that i saw was this idea that your brand name is two , but it turned out to be a sizable pages -- the morgan lockeover is a remarkable brand .
in other services , like the use of fertilizer , 105 : 05 : 55 : 565 -- by the end , 05 : 05 : 55 or aviation or air traffic light , is much smaller for improvement .
we see this here , when i take things old , i can confuse them like the right-hand side , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salz , and i can make them intuitive , or i can actually create intuitive things by showing things .
this is what it turns out to be : if you have a placebo in a white pill , in the form of a pirate tablet , that &apos;s just a round ball of white pill , which has a particular effect on it .
the coal evolution of the industrial revolution , the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a ratio in the tank , and so we have refrigerators , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
we took the light off , we put it in a vacuum , and we put the whole air out of the air , and it &apos;s almost all the way up to the same , alone , the metal was free , as it always wanted to be .

together , the uneducated cultures in the world are bringing together a web of spiritual and cultural life that is surrounded by the earth and probably the earth as important as the biological life network that you know as the biosphere .
for example , you take this child from the barasana in the north of the amazon , the people of the people who were there , believe that mythologically , they were also coming from the milky way river .
some bacteria found out how they can hold themselves from penicillin and have this information with other bacteria in the dna , and now we &apos;ve written lots of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because bacteria communicate .
and i want to say something that is a feminist for a feminist something radical , and that is , i think , that there may be different kinds of insights that are different kinds of anatomy of anatomy , especially when people use a group .
now let me introduce you to an elephant that &apos;s been carried by amanda , who , 19 years ago , had a spinal cord injury , which was the result that she couldn &apos;t walk more for 19 years and now .

and dr. kean told me , he said , &quot; i learned that children , if they don &apos;t get anything else all the time , and even if they get a little support , if you let kids overcome themselves , then kids can achieve very much . &quot;
if we get to these really big bridges -- with over 100,000 base pairs -- they &apos;re not going to grow into ecoli . it &apos;s going to grow all of the modern molecular biology , and so we &apos;re going to convert ourselves to different mechanisms .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a foreign , a neutral , a neutral , in the image -- not just , but what you have to be grateful , maybe a gift of the boat .
and so i think of the city as a very different view , a very different impression , which is that i see negative and positive zones in a city , and in this way , a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
but that &apos;s the most networking thing that can happen , because this is the group &apos;s forced to help with patients , because it could be used against obesity , or it could drift the patient .
as i said , i &apos;ve been in the course of the years of doing some pretty horrible situations , but nothing allowed me to prepare , nothing could me , anything like this , and so dangerous with these guys in a room .
and that &apos;s very amazing , because you think that this high-tech technology that you meet is actually a future in the future , but in fact , it &apos;s the future that &apos;s right in our archaeal roots .
and because i was born without any legs , and my feet had moved to them , and i only had a few toes on this one , and a few sessions were over the other foot , and he had to get the strangers to get the bad news .
but it would be worse if i wasn &apos;t going to remind myself that i was confronted about 20 years ago when i first told me that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of angular response .
if we &apos;re in a game world , i think many of us are turning into our best version , and at the moment , are ready to solve the hard problem , as long as it takes , to try to get back to the eradicate .
and since i &apos;m just holding one of these little devices up because things are always going to be more intuitive , more natural , more natural , friendly , and you &apos;ve got to look at what &apos;s actually for us , of course , what is used to be friendly or intuitive .
do you have no fear that you live your life for a long time , and you never create something , and you &apos;re going to die on a shrink board , your mouth -- your mouth filled with the bitter packets of the embodiment ?
and then when i take a half-foot segment , we don &apos;t even see more just a unit , which is a circle , and we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a circle , a different one .
they took these photographs from the forest floor to try to see behind the face or the character , and they found nothing , and they concluded that this was the right maps of the devil , and the five mix with the spears .
i &apos;ve always been writing my synthetic dictionary , but i &apos;ve been willing to work with the texture of the texture , and i &apos;ve never noticed that in my life , what the word disabled word &quot; means . &quot;
and as a result , tumors , and with this sentence , i &apos;d like to conclude , and again , to give the clue to , designers have to think differently to come to new solutions , and in this sense , i &apos;m right to you and ask your attention to your attention .
and i definitely know that it would be for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start this dark path that would sort of fit in front of you -- especially in which i &apos;m in my career .
the older black man stood up . he looked at the deputy , and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come here to tell this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal . don &apos;t give her to her . &quot;
so , the problem of cooperative online worlds such as the world warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying , at the moment , to stand on the edge of a episode , that we prefer to spend all of our time in these worlds .
later on day , i drove to this piece of miguel , and i asked him , &quot; i said , &quot; for a place that seems so , of course , &quot; as any farm that i had ever been , &quot; how do you succeed ? &quot;
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ape apple , which for three million years the size of the under-48 states , has shrunk 40 percent .
in urban communities everywhere in the country -- from los angeles across philadelphia , baltimore to washington to -- 50 to 60 percent of all men are either black men in prison , in jail or in prison with conditions .
immediately after that election , between the 21st and the 24th grade , february , a delegation of about 30 famine allowed the world to be two places that were most interested in trying to get out of the town of the town .
the last example that i have today to show , is a musician sequence for limit , which we &apos;ve developed recently , and in jail , as leaders , and bass stuff .
and we started making pieces of pieces , starting with staggering the fifth and seventh letter , and we started putting these together to make 24,000 letters back together , up to 7,000 .
they enable us to tell the story of neuroman &apos;s marketing , as we tell the story in this movie , that today you use mris to make the fun of the brain , to make both advertising and movies .
so i started thinking , and so i think , with security in the past months , while i was working on the book , that &apos;s soon becoming -- as the dangerous , scary , strong expectation of my driving experience .
both in my profession , robin , and in my side , a volunteer as a volunteer , i &apos;m a fireman of generosity and kindness and kindness , but i also see the last love and mutant of each other .
suppose you live in a certain remote area , and you have a loved ones with people with heart disease , and you have your family overwhelming these cardiologists , whose average performance is 200 .
but when i asked him about his telephones , and he asked him why he did this intervention -- it was high surgeries -- his answer was that , in his country , those kids would be very bad , and so he had to do it .
and , of course , when it &apos;s also intuitively intuitive , and how i can take it over as an age , and just take the things so that they can use a user interface , so intuitively , they &apos;re intuitively intuitive , because they &apos;re fun , and they &apos;re easy to use .
it &apos;s a system where there are two fundamental positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do . those who are sleeping with no constraints and the constraints with bad results and the good results .
also , the three big problems . the cost , especially in high-regulation countries are high , and the question is , after security , you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human work , is that the fuel will not be used for weapons .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid of a real gasoline , and it keeps millions of people off the blooms .
now , to decide not to buy a glass brands is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our tactics -- but it turns out that the decision-making process is affecting us in very constructive decisions .
i don &apos;t have to adjust this stuff , because at the same time , it &apos;s going to be a different crap , colorful , scattering of the outcome , just waiting for me if i love a little bit in the heart , and i have it in the heart .
so this is one effect . the other effect is that , even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end up with less peace with the outcome than if we had the opportunity to choose less possibilities .
here &apos;s a photograph that i took at the north of the baffin islands when i went to the front door of the whisper , and this man , aolya , told me a wonderful story of his father .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , when a tyranny of the memory itself , and you can think of the memory itself as a way of living through the experience itself .
i mean , if i &apos;m alone , i do all kinds of weird stuff , but then i get to other people and i listen to all these things because i don &apos;t want to do it with it , or frankly , they say , they &apos;re disappearing .
in the rich world , in the top billion , we might be able to take off and use less , but on average , that number is going to go up every year and get more than twice the number of the services per person .
i met these people from grasl , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to inject a light on any surface , and then , with a laser pointer on it , which is just the negative regions .
so what that means is , if we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place of people in evolution , and especially as we look forward to the next phase i would say , there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
so there &apos;s great prizes here . there are challenges in transmission , and if we say that the energy source is outside the country , it &apos;s not just the technology you need to deal with the risk of where energy comes from .
but , as we think , the only kind of biology is going to make a big impact on the cost of the cost of food , or the limitations of its kind , when we see co2 as co2 , and so we &apos;re working on these cells , and we &apos;re going to go to the way .
i started working with making scientific literature about how these centrifurists are built in natorities and found that they &apos;re structured in turics in so-called kascade , and each capurity contains 164 centuries .
now , the fascinating thing is that the beetle color that &apos;s contains in the liano , mainhibitors are exactly the way that &apos;s necessary to shrink the trype , so they ask themselves .
this is a problem , because the global warming are flourishing for the arctic ocean , where there are large quantities of frozen carbon , which , if it &apos;s being replaced by microbes .
and what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack was actually to let it happen , and slowly -- obviously , trying to desperate engineers , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get behind it .
so maybe germans of this technology of technological change , because the fact that there was always a different truth , which is that every human society can give something special and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt to adapt to , is our greatest plus .
my good friend ray short-term has shown us that every tool that &apos;s going to become the information technology , on the curve from moore &apos;s law , makes it big , and the price of the price performance , all 12 to 12 months .
the first project that we did as an international group , as we became aware of ourselves , o.k , there &apos;s now us as a real scene , and we are online , and we know so the people who are there and so forth .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never be as moving as other kids , or you would never lead an independent life test , and they just punished me . &quot;
what if we could turn that situation around , and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going out to the other , we start to go from lots of things to lots of things , and by seeing patterns that were listed in the past ?
that means we feel so guilty about the earth , that we say , there is no bio-build , no bioluminescent , no major progression , and as you can all find that our own credibility will go back .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i put something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in lifespan , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is placed in both of the cells .
this was worth all of this year to be in the clean room , because , check , check out , the massless difference between an individual and the metal is about as much as the difference between the metal and all of you .
and i then got up to six-foot , and then we got together with friends of the company , and then we got together with the company on the company , and then we got together with the spin qaeda of the world &apos;s largest cell in the world .
at that time , it was just like a monont , where you had a needle , and others said , you know , you &apos;re actually crushed to read the people when they want to read , they want to talk to you again , and that &apos;s totally fatal .
if a darkman in spain has done something unpossible , something magical : allah , al√© , al√© , allah , great , great unbelievable , there &apos;s a refugee : a whisper look at god .
so what happens in &quot; the morality of science is that everything from the bottom up to the very beginning , from the very beginning to the very end , with marks -- from the front of the film you &apos;re going to see in the film , which is the marx .
and the message is now , we need to eradicate these rotates , if we sort of forced our goals , 20 percent , 20 percent , triangle , three , three percent , three and so on , if we want to reach the ones , we want to reach them .
they have then given a three-month period of time with a &quot; plentiful &quot; the note very well . it told them that they were very smart , and they were very smart , and after those three months they really wrote .
it &apos;s in that -- what i &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is made of normal letters that we use to symbolize -- and i &apos;ve written my visitors on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve described it 10 times as 10 times .
and i wonder today , as much as his vision of me as a starter and powerful girl has shaped my self-assembly image and i could imagine , as a way of looking at a powerful , powerful and powerful man .
and that &apos;s where they &apos;re also called from my communist doctor , so he can see where my weight of weight is , and that &apos;s not just in the moment that i need a cardiology or support , but also with a glimpse in the past .
but in fact , it was an outline in the early &apos; 80s when i was starting to start with the elementary school and start to build my self-assembly of my family and shape , in terms of other kids and the rest of the world around me .
it &apos;s a picture of the first punishment of the beetle that refers all the way back to the lhc , and then recommended it with a part of the lhc to make a rain from the scores on the detector .
he brought 400,000 people around his people , because he insisted that red bone , beef and smoke &apos;s much more effective than antiretroviral drugs are , of which we know they can take the course of aids .
and finally , i believe that even though it &apos;s so dramatically , so beautiful and inspiring , and so on , we &apos;re not measured at the end of our technology , we &apos;re not going to develop things that we &apos;re developing , not to our minds and our minds .
so instead , what i do , and what the designers do is make a sense of wonder , we think of a certain abstraction , this machine , and the machine makes it do something that transforms our skills far better , and faster than we could ever do .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 shops around the world , with students , developers and architects , even with ctos of the fortune fortune 50-dollar company , and there &apos;s something about this kind of task , which is the depth of nature in nature , and i want to share some of them with you .
and as you can see , one is our seven senses , most of us think we &apos;ve only got five , and now we &apos;ve even recognized seven , because there &apos;s certainly in the near future , the next apartment , and as a extension of our own self .
what you &apos;ve got to do , maybe it &apos;s easy , but it &apos;s not . you &apos;d have to take all the co2 that comes from the burning of the grave , you know , you get pressure under pressure and then you &apos;d like to get there and hope that it stays there .
and as by a miracle , he took his spirits and started to play some of the nights from inconcerts , and then asked me to play them at the end of the game : delsnian , tvi , swi , livestock .
i committed to the place and to his brother , and his father -- with the words , &quot; well , my proposal is this : tony , tony , we &apos;re going to talk to him a device , and we &apos;re going to find a way to get a way back to his art .
now i have to stand when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex , sex , death , death , death -- it seemed pretty reasonable to the moment , but at every year , it came to my second .
i &apos;m a historic historian , and in this case , i study people with anatomy -- meaning , human body , animal body -- how they went with body fluid , concepts , concepts , how they thought about bodies .
because i don &apos;t care whether it &apos;s the minister of health , the minister says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my mammography or &quot; any creator who wants to treat his patients with caffs .
so now , if i do that , the profiles the profiles of the site , then , collect any of those hair samples , and then they turn on that method , and then they can say , &quot; okay , this guy belongs to this guy . &quot;
he would contain the dog , and improvised an iranian , took the skeleton of the dog , and improved a relax , relaxed a different dog , and escaped the ice sheets with the potassium knife .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- is it grew up , or siamesian twins , it &apos;s been sexy -- from surgeons often adapted to norms , not because it would be part of their bodies .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like , centuries ago , centuries ago , in the norway of monument people with sacred dancers and music that have been tortured for hours to morality .
so i wrote a paper about it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; french , &quot; why they believed that molecules were going to shoot a certain kind of randomly handing an area on the area of nature .
then the next ones that have been working with &apos; nem model , or mental model like the software business , have been working , namely , would have been a metaphor to make a metaphor , which is to make a metaphor to use of the computer &apos;s computer .
the spirits can be complained under the big water , responded to the rhythm of the dance , to deny the soul of the survivors of the living , so that the olymmian is going to end a short little bit for god .
it was on a piano curriculum for music students at my beloved teacher , professor jones , a famous beethoven , a beethoven &apos;s communications , and slow professor &apos;s slow professor at high school here in high school .
but that &apos;s my prototype , which is kind of like the prototype , but it &apos;s pretty much riding , so on a tent , the thing that we put on the ark and the pressure , and that was the pressure , but it was too high , it was broken .
we took a ps3-camera , we built it , we put it on a led-on light , and we now have a device that &apos;s free -- you can build it yourself , we give the code to the software that you can download for free .
we &apos;re looking into this net , and we see the fifth hertz , and if it &apos;s going to get a nine-and-a-half commands , we &apos;re going to take a few valves , then a bible gets in , then we &apos;ll come back up again .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year and work in an environment which is quite what they really hate , we actually had them in the government .
in the case that we did this simple thing , there was an increase in the participation of 20 percent , and there was a increase in the number of people who were ready to save the number of people , or to watch a four percent when they were ready to pay for the reconstruction .
there &apos;s evidence that neanderthal has already been the neanderthals 60,000 years ago , and people with severe injuries with severe injuries , and that may have happened because life experience in the survival of these people was valuable for the society .
now , we have three versions of the law , which is to bring people behind the grid , to a bicycle theft , to the theft of the theft , that instead of giving them the stuff that &apos;s going to give back to the victims .
the idea is , again , imagine that we bring back the people to do something and the environment -- almost as much as we call it , clouds like building a disparate , but with a cloud .
and yes , you can see , it &apos;s relatively heterogeneous , so there are people who do the home alone , until big organizations , which are more than that , in fact , in the institutional form .
and to me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science in the field of anatomy makes the case that we &apos;re going to reach a point where we need to be able to give democracy a democracy to terms in anatomy ?
i got to degree , and i hope that video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the bachelan work of michael burk , kathris , joris and janitors and janitors .
and there &apos;s even better , the things that they spend , and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , video and photo video , libraries and libraries of music and technology , technology to diagnose medical -- are literally dedicated and cheaper in your cell phone .
hence , because you assume that he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s with xy -- you know , he &apos;s going to assume that he &apos;s a male , he can now get involved in what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
eventually , a result of buying a bad jeans , if there &apos;s only one kind of thing to buy , that if you are unhappy , and you wonder why , who is the answer . the world is responsible . what are you going to do ?
&quot; when we were fighting in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted to do everything , but what we needed most was hope was a prioritization that will sometimes be hoping to be hopeless , and &quot; be . &quot;
here you have this censorship between the unconscious and the conscious , immediately after that you can do something about it , and the things you know , that you look very differently , so that you can make a lot better for you and others .
because i believe that the interactive media in us , cognitive models , cognitive models , paradigms that have been very suspended in our biological memory , very long time , and that we can now refer to the interactive media .
afterwards , the old tyrannical civilization , which is the cartoon of colonial coastal columns , and then the consequence of the top of this volcanic people moved back to a olithic massive massive massive massive massive massive , across the caribbean plane .
and before the background , i &apos;ve changed myself in the field of interface design , so the next generation of man in the computer , in the computer of the computer &apos;s relationship with the computer , how our tools , or how the computer changes the computer from the sukessive to the digital assistance to the digital assistant .
and i know that some of you are saying , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; the world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we were all talking a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be a new language . let &apos;s be channel .
so she goes to the house , and she &apos;s looking for the paper , and the poem goes through , and she goes through a pencil as she goes through it , and then she said -- it was like , with her other hand , and she grabbed it .
if i were to take that agreement seriously , i would be born into a world that someone like me as a person would perceive me , their life in a positive way today , but today i &apos;m going to be able to recover the opportunity for the odds and the adventure that i celebrated .
that was the problem : transparency -- free of disappointment , and just to discover , and look at it immediately ; immediately looking at characteristic and access to information , particularly in terms of business , which is the last thing -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
we have this donation , we have these things that we want to live in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to do a rich hand , and it wasn &apos;t all the fences that i wanted to flick all the experiences i wanted to do and never did .
if we change the plastics , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water storage , inside , you can go back to cellulogic , then you can go back with a baby in israel or tunisia in hundreds of thousands of trees .
and it turns out that , under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 60,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a 60,000 dollars a year in the year .
i think it may be about making sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome drivestock , but we &apos;re open to the poor , to the poor , to put it on the front of a chamber , and maybe dance with it .
the congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the space of a violent confrontation that has declined for decades and so many lives in the first world war .
so this whole discussion , like , is going to move in the moment , and it &apos;s going to move energy , like this is going to go , on the island , for example , for five to three percent extent , so we &apos;re going to go to the wind and the sun .
so we started with some volunteers who were going to help us do something more than one year , in seattle , to march the things that they called away from them -- different kinds of things that you can see -- things that you would throw away .
tan le , anonymous residents of footage , was now the wing and social activist activist activist , who was invited to places they had never heard of , and exposed to their existence , their existence , their existence could never imagine .
they knew that every year , every year , about 75,000 honors leave their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people stay in their country can stay and do the same in honoras .
now , if you take this image -- i &apos;m originally an italian , and every young boy grows in italy with this image in his room , but why i &apos;m showing you this is because of the formula in the last few decades , something very interesting has happened .
in some of the following expeditions , i saw creatures in thermal sources , and sometimes things that i &apos;d never seen before had seen before , sometimes things that nobody had ever seen before and saw for science at the time when we didn &apos;t see it , didn &apos;t have words .
we believe that smallpolek -- we believe that smallpox is not persuasive , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world , and our millions of thousands of people have come up with a month .
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should distribute human rights in some ways , because i have to admit that i know a series of real estate , which probably deserves more than some people i know .
and this is what we have to look at millions of factors around the world when we take the next century of attack in the reef , the face of the face , the face of all drives on the edge of an episode .
what kids do is make sure that they start with the marshmallow and prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top , so that they have several times the chance to repair the possibility of repair prototyping prototypes .
and then , under the other things that are already there , that are completely within the day , which is the most people , but is not aware of , for example , the mediterranean , which allow us to wash , with four degrees , are also genetically optimized .
and then they go to the consumer electronics business for making a stereo system -- speakers , cd , player &apos;s , radio , radio , radio , and in this one electronics business , there &apos;s so many stereo .
i find that they were so busy and strong , and so radical , where they did what i did for all the years to look at the malignant 1776 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s completely forgotten .
what we &apos;ve learned from cultural surgeries is that women , average , average -- not every average -- but rather complex social relations and worry about people who are within the group of the group , who are very , very much attention .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon that i talked to a few years ago , who had caught some siamesian twins to make them divide , to make a name , to make a name .
now , to put these theories together , we call ourselves in memory that it &apos;s definitely high-resolution , you know , it &apos;s a high-end goal , and it &apos;s probably in iran , because most of the infections have been reported .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you take the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in a course about whether you should have that , if you want to get things faster , or if that innovation needs longer than we expect .
this was a huge session at the time , because , of course , the living language began to manifest manifesto in the form of scripts , which is what flows and living , and i &apos;m going to do it and manipulate it in stone , and i &apos;m going to manipulate it .
when the golden cat first , her 10 on the worst selling cat was sold at the worst catalyst , they thought that the winner was 87 percent -- a result of the rise of the salvation and the reducing costs of cost .
so the tedtalk in very simple form , is that a charter city is a place where uninhabited land is an insane , the laws that extend the laws , and the people who choose to decide either to live under those rules or not .
we followed the genetics back eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural tower , and when we asked people about it , they said that one of the people had become so old , because he died because of the alarm , and we killed him with the spear .
but if we look at this metabolic map that &apos;s very simple , compared to our confidence , and you can trust me , it &apos;s simple . but if we look at all of these genes that we can see from one of the other , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
if you just took a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose this wish , the half-hour of energy , without co2 , i &apos;m going to be going to be making this wish .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is somebody who &apos;s freaked him when he &apos;s lonely , because he knows it &apos;s not very good at the table when he &apos;s covered in a snow of snow .
at this point , the patients come into play . they can &apos;t just take control of control , chapter your own ship , but can also help with health care of the challenges that we face , and the cost of health care , double , double and so on .
and then there &apos;s a memory of self , and the memory of self is that , that &apos;s counting , and the story of our life is right , and it &apos;s the doctor that talks about the doctor by saying , &quot; how do you feel in the last day ? &quot;
now , in the world of the savings , i believe one of the best examples that have come to the market about how to say the best choice in the election , was something which was very strong at ibm , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
and about an hour after she came home , after i finished it , she came home , she collapsed and she called the 911 years . the rescue assistant brought back to the emergency station with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous state .
but i remember the lights of the oil spills before the malayan coast , and on the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the first flavor of the apple , the one of the men on the platform .
now , what this thing is doing is that it starts to take the values of sensors -- so for example , from printing sensors and vibration sensors -- and it makes legitimate code for the code , while the folding , with folding data .
how can these people come from a flora from 80,000 species of indigent plants that don &apos;t find these two morphologically related plants that when combined in this way , a kind of biochemical version , that this is so bigger than the sum of its parts ?
and there was a time when there was only one jeans in the jeans , and they bought them , and they were bad , they were incredibly uncomfortable , and when they were wearing them long enough , and often enough , they had started to feel &quot; ok . &quot;
and now you could talk about why this is a disappointment , why not perceive that there are only three fingers at the bottom : because the mind and the way it works , it doesn &apos;t include it , one , two , three , but it looks like a group .
and these sounds , and this rhythm , the geology , the topography of a region , and it also enabled that , of course , that you could put these fragments together , and put together on the left , and then also move back to the hill .
i also believe there are theories that start to understand how everything goes with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplistic story of what &apos;s going on in this little oil spill , which contains different kinds of chemicals for receptions .
how many times we chose a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we reject ourselves and expect the government to reflect our values and our needs , and then our needs , and then hasn &apos;t changed much ?
now this could happen within the lifespan of an individual organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , because this information had to learn from the individuals who had to died about the fruit of these frustrating , because these information processed structures weren &apos;t there yet .
for example , there &apos;s an anecdote that reports the report of a capitalist , which was done in this large area of fishing , can &apos;t be used , or of fishing scientists don &apos;t normally be accomplished because they &apos;re not scientific . &quot;
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people will be convicted by general , but the ethnicity , the destruction of the human life , is not only convicted , but my general and many of them as part of a developing strategy .
what if you could change the sperm and eggs or the frozen fertilizer to change your kids to live a better chance for a healthy life -- the diabetes , the rehearsal , the crossroads , the risk of cancer , the risk of cancer ?
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria , are the thermophil &apos;s , and in doing so , the hot jewelry would be if fish were there , it would be acoustic , but they would have managed to make a residential environment for themselves .
the great geneticists in the 20th century , tg.b.b. hansky , who was also a communicator in the russian orthodox church once wrote a sentence , a sentence that said , &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense except the evolution of evolution . &quot;
and if you do this for a few minutes , you &apos;ll be able to do that the living self is made by a bad patient , and you realize that the memory of a much better patient is much better , because now you &apos;ve given a better experience to your experience .
so not just a farm that feeds their animals , not just a farm that measures their success on their health of their predators , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water plant , and not just for these fish , but for me .
you know , as a translator , it &apos;s not just a word for the word &quot; text in a different language , but also the deeper sense of words and the word &quot; pamusi &quot; must understand , so that there &apos;s a meaningful translation to know anyone who has to do with strangers .
and , again , if i take a step back and look at it all , i can maybe rearrange my anger to my search past , here , i &apos;m looking for nectistic , here , after here , i &apos;m going to live here , or to live here , live pivos .
now , what you could do with a patient , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s been worked , and it works , you could actually take the reflection of a digestive patient by just leaving the mud without getting too much up to him .
you do it in order to make the task , to the challenge and the ocean , and the ocean is the most challenging environment that you do . you make it done , because of the strange connection , which is when a small group of people create a team of people .
i took them up , and i admit them to the world down there : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme situations . i took them to sources of sources so they could take samples and test instruments and so on .
you understand that it &apos;s not just that it means that people have to eat startling food when they go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to put it back in , it means that it &apos;s so hard to make you feel great investing in their workplace .
and during that whole time , they &apos;re going to be bringing cultural values into society . values that includes the claims that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological thing -- equation .
the leaders of the government in honduras would be based on the aid of partnership countries , they could benefit from their partnership to countries that would be supported by the laws of the laws of this charter and the charter of the leadership , that everybody could trust that the charter will really be carried .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the ideality to play with the new elements -- like the howinner -- and also how the game requires both trust and promotes -- while it makes a tremendous amount of fun .
he was driving at high speed when he was suddenly a little fragment of a fragment that sounds like the inspiration , which is often very difficult for him , for jellyfish . and he wants to do it . she &apos;s pray . he &apos;s full of it , but he can &apos;t touch it .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born when young boy , when he had a friend , had sex with his friend , when he had died , and he just found out that he had bug and had a mother .
but there was only one company , an agent ready to help us -- and that &apos;s just because i know john bond and richard shenine tree for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to deal with the middle class and go straight to my team .
in fact , i &apos;ve dedicated the biggest part of my career to make a terrible situations , and that &apos;s only for trying to study social issues that are so compelling and interesting , and hopefully a way of doing what it does to the audience and to do .
and this curiosity also showed that when i wasn &apos;t in school , when i was in school , through the forests , went down and went , &quot; samples , frozen and beetles and beetles and beetles and beetles and beetles , and i brought it all home , and under the microscope .
she ran like the devil to go to the house while she was purchased by this poem , and the only thing that she did was to quickly get to a piece of paper and to get a pen , so she had to get it through donnine , and start to the leaf .
the next few weeks , i was making my forehead , and i first learned the unhealthy ones that exist in our medical culture -- i felt myself , not the kind of reference that you could feel , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
now , i may be a little bit extremely extreme , you know , like a little bit of appetite i refer to the towns of memories , but even if you make more of it , there &apos;s a question . why do we spend so much weight in the mind so much weight , the weight that we give ?
you can think of this cultural grid as a ethnosphere , a nosphere , and ethnosphere can be defined as the total sum of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas and intuitions , intuitions that have been given by human imagination since the imagination of consciousness .
so where the founding fathers were extraordinarily impressive to figure out how individuals are protected from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers in this concept , we have more of a concept of cheetay , not just how to worry about each other , but how we can care for each other .
the main reason for this is that maybe we can enjoy this huge amount of mayan shelter , senior , senior and marble , but we don &apos;t see the same digestion and sabbatical , and then actually take something out of the fantastic commandment .
by playing music and talking about music , it was from this paranoid , confusing man , who was still lifted by the streets of los angeles , a loving , trained , dear , drawing , skilled , dragged in juil-like musicians .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of his life was the tom of the body &apos;s body embodied artist who was trying to control this uncontroversial impulse that comes to him , and with them .
i &apos;m going to describe to you now a study that i saw with guberman , eve cama , enica , ji , which led us to make the decisions for almost one million american plans to look at the entire united states .
the reason for that is , if i draw it on a normal curve , where we say , this is the years , so the timeline is a kind of a , and this is a very popular technology that i want to talk to you with a graph , then the graph is going to be mountains .
and when i think about it , i think about a vacation that we did a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i had ever had , and i think , quite often , in relation to the relationship , i think about how many other words were .
and maybe a little look at what might happen in a few decades , if you have cyborg bodies to study something or other things , to do in all kinds of humankind , humanitarian scenarios that i can think of as a science fan .
many companies tend to do that -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re going to avoid fear , they &apos;re these elements , and they &apos;re going to welcome to the welcome , and they &apos;re actually turning into something positive , and this is a skill .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like in iran , where a man who feels to other men has drawn to the death penalty , because he &apos;s ready to move to a gender where he can stay alive .
and they &apos;re going to be driven by using the use of the tricoder , and they &apos;re going to be trained by the khan-academy , and by doing so that they have the opportunity to print 3d printer and printer , and so much more productive , and so much more productive than ever before .
now we know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t attract us between us and white , or between male and sexuality and sexual internal and sexual interdependence ; we are , we are , of course , as the line of course .
so if you look at google glasses , for example , then there &apos;s such a concept of what the virtual world can recombine us with the real world , which means that our monkey to the virtual virtualization , the virtual virtue as something natural , recommend to recommend .
for some time , i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect , and it may seem weird that a magician is interested in it , because they think it &apos;s like , &quot; i think , &quot; a disappointment that &apos;s going to become something if somebody believes enough . &quot;
we &apos;ve worked with roberto bolt bolt , one of the best ballet dancers in our time -- the danger of the metropolitan theater in new york and scrubber -- we &apos;ve taken his movements into 3d to use them as the flyentry .
there are some mushrooms that are doing this on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to get 100 percent to get very difficult . and an agreement for the co2 is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the biggest problem .
so what you got was this : this is your name here : my tedtalk , which you don &apos;t know , which is going to be the topic , and the more you can go to the contaminants you can fly to the ears , especially if i put your company to your dummy papers .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to rediscover the opportunity to be what we are : people with consciousness , who are important to realize that all people and gardens can become a room , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
so these elderly people come to me now and say , &quot; look , steamson , you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re talking to the talks , you &apos;re going to tell people that you &apos;re going to say , we &apos;re going to do it for the first time in the history of our nation with our nation , &quot; after 9 / 11 . &quot;
now , the people behind the back , or the people who will see that later on in the video , will say , &quot; well , yes , this is quite impressive , but if it were real , it would be real , it would be -- you can see here &apos;s a hole there , and if it were real , it would be real , it would be flower . &quot;
now , as a consequence of that , he &apos;s particularly prone to these schizophrenic phases , and sometimes bad , and sometimes he &apos;s disappeared , in the streets of passenger pigeon , always this horror and the jellyfish of his own mind .
he was talking in a very hot , and he was talking about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and about how dodgers never would make it into the world , and all because of the absence of the first passenger pigeon in the last part of beethoven sinia .
always when we think of longevity and landscape , we either refer to roussew and the old grave of the wild wilderness , which is a rapid thought , or on the other hand , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are connected .
i wanted to return to the routine and the empiriment of the life of an unknown orchestra -- a grandmother , a mother , two daughters that have defted every day for the years by putting together the stories of their narrative , and we still slept three in the same bed .
but we don &apos;t even listen to somebody when we hear something like this , because we know this kind of time for so long . somehow , we kind of missed the internal and accepted collective creativity , and we kind of like to say , &quot; well , i mean , art together &quot; -- always leads to the elsewhere .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually using a new kind of network that was used in the whole world -- that &apos;s a mobile phone -- and anonymous and aggregated information from this network that would be collected by neanderthals to understand how the city works .
and then the renaissance , and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put human individual into the center of the universe -- all mysteries and mysteries . there &apos;s no more room for myth , the feminine from the divine .
in our desire to protect people who are at the heart and tell you the cold , hard truth about their medical profiles , or even a proper quality of life that they have to anticipate , that we don &apos;t have to adjust the basins that somebody &apos;s actually disabled .
i told you about four techniques that tells you the problem of decision-making surgeries -- they &apos;re going to convert the liquid alternative ; concrete concrete -- they &apos;re doing it real ; categorized -- we can do better with categories , less possibilities .
because we have these self-deception , this feeling , to be great , triggered by the highest creature , not by such a recurrent , of something that exists like a organism that exists to give you a rock and other things that &apos;s unsustainable for us .
and that &apos;s when you &apos;re all feeling your feelings about politics and the snake in the workplace and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about is , in the words of tim , in the words of tim o &apos;lly , &quot; which we do in common , we can &apos;t do it alone . &quot;
this may seem like , first of all , a little bit of a digitization , so i repeat it so that it can work out : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , global warming and obesity and obesity , i think we need to try to play online for about 21 billion hours a week for the next decade .
and our goal was that we wanted to go to seven-percent renewables , and then there &apos;s this rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable renewables , which is going to be very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work out that batteries are made out of batteries .
but what &apos;s going to happen is 17 degrees who were ready to take care of these control , who wanted to do business with somebody like this , and i &apos;m playing like this , and finally , tell us to tell ourselves stories that we don &apos;t usually have -- stories that would never support a fever .
but in fact , you had thought about it for a long time , but you could never simulate whether it would work , but since there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can see there , and you can see that , yes , with the right kind of material stuff , it looks like this , it looks more functional .
but the process and the severe sticks that surrounded him was raised as a genius , where he took out the gene , and he didn &apos;t let him go back and left him where he came back , and he realized that it had no internal thing , had to be jellyfish .
this particular event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called accompaniy , pray -- that , unlike all my previous books from around the world , and a great mega-lapse event , that was pollinated .
a continent is always expanded because the idea was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious faith . of course , there was a voodoo , and it &apos;s just the remaining end of that very profound religious thought , as the tragedies of the tragedies of slavery came over time .
but in fact , we &apos;re always seeing it more and more that if you &apos;re ready to go , and the unimportant equations , well , there &apos;s an increase , there &apos;s a cost of cost , there &apos;s a cost of reference , and there &apos;s a &amp; amp ; d perception of decision-making .
and one day , he looked at me at one of my practices -- these practices were just tired and gnadoes -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a powerful , powerful girl , and you &apos;re going to have a young girl , you &apos;re going to have one day of these fears .
and wind and the sun and the load and the load came through , and the outcome result , a very exciting outcome of the conventional system that you need to get to the conventional system , which takes about five cents a hundred cents a kilotic hour of oil , which is about four cents a mile .
and the problem , it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can just be a gangm problem of what things like simple things , so a very simple problem , a question , a question , and how can you do it differently , or how can you do that better ?
feeding grain of plant food , scissors deflation resources to monocultures , chemicals on earth , chicken hills , and all the time the agricultural industry just asked , &quot; if we feed more cheaper , how bad can it be ? &quot;
not through the latest address -- and tractable inventions , but through fruits , through fruit land , not through pumps , but through fresh water , through water , not through tension , but through the forests , and not through fishermen and nets , but through the sea .
so these are the ones that have a more artistic direction , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and philosophers and collaboration with scientists who are busy doing this with these technologies and asking questions , and they &apos;re creative , because there &apos;s some kind of exhibitions , and you know , you know , all kinds of things .
you put it on the out-of-the-box co2 which leads to temperature &apos;s temperature , and that temperature has a lot of improvements , and it &apos;s a lot more effective , and perhaps the worse , the indians , that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to such changes , and so all these systems can collapse .
and then , you know , these are things that matter , like the prince , like the prince , the prince , unloaded , unlocked , loving and loved ones like flynesh , and , mill , glorically , magical , magical , magical , magical , and mycelium .
in other words , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ranked and ranked , and she ranked , but she didn &apos;t get the house , and the poem went through them , and she passes it . she said it would go over land -- and she said -- she &apos;d look for another poet .
and maybe that contribute to a modernism , and if you &apos;re doing better than me , that would be great , but my core point here is that we need to work on all those five , and we can &apos;t give them any of them up , because they &apos;ve got us all wrong problems .
and where you see how far we are from that , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , that we can be on earth , you can see that , for example , there &apos;s a program , until you want to be in the first place , you want to be eudian , right ?
in my about 20 years of medical consciousness , and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal study of medical error and so on to make all sorts of my first article for the first article , which i wrote to the toronto &quot; star code , &quot; black , &quot; and i wrote &quot; black , &quot; and i wrote .
so with the total transparency of transparency , which is the new thinking , which is on the old crushing , you know , doesn &apos;t say that in the laser system , it &apos;s not a cup of meat , or other phenomena or other phenomena , which i just want to verify , and that &apos;s not going to do that .
now , not that exactly what i hoped was , but i went up -- the stairs , the tips , the floors , the firemen , the firemen , over at that point , were pretty much ready to go into the bedrock of a pair of shoes .
i had to finally reconcile some of these poets , elastic trees -- in different colors -- you know , to build my muscles . and i hated them more than anything . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
but we wanted to go much further , and we wanted to build a bacterial chromosome , and it has more than 50,000 letters of the genetic code , so we thought we were able to build it in the size of the virus , which we could understand the size of the species , to understand all the individual components of a living cell .
and for a conversation this morning , with dean kative , one of the innovators of the magazine , i want to share something with you -- he gave me the permission -- his technical , &quot; the slums , &quot; and many of you may have heard about . it &apos;s got the size of a refrigerator .
now , &quot; clouds &quot; -- something that my friends in autodesk call &quot; desk , &quot; sensors , sensors and networks , robots , 3d printing , enabling the personal production of our planet , synthetic biology , vaccine , digital vaccinations , digital food and digital materials and artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence .
look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo actors in a state of ceo , the light bulbs without burning , an amazing acoustic view of the mind of the mind , so that it &apos;s going to affect the body , that when it comes to an extreme imperative , it &apos;s going to be replaced .
this was the most surely surveillance form of a dju vu that i &apos;ve ever experienced . because before i knew a corner , i knew what was going to happen in the light of the vehicle , because i was going to run monthly film , when we turned the movie .
in this picture , i have a bush &apos;s bush as a center of despair in all directions , because if you look at the mating tree of life , all the existing specials in the branches of these two evolutionary success have survived in evolutionary success : they survived ; it has its environment and its strength .
and then , with this premise , with this premise of this premise , then , for example , brian gger tried to put together in england , a minimum , then a steam of pressure , a hot cap , and a hot plate , so that wright , and then bacteria worked together .
and then , just from the do-it-it-it-it-oy website , the founder of founder , and he said , &quot; o.k , we have to meet ourselves now , really , really , real , and then two organized spots , one in london , a thousand , 10 thousand , and a half in the san francisco , in san francisco . &quot;
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- you want to get zero , and that &apos;s dependent on the number of people who are dependent on the services , and every person who uses the average energy , the average energy for everybody , and the co2 , which is emitting the energy per unit .
and the insight of president lobo was that the kind of wisdom that i thought about was a long way to get the investors to come and build this city , and it could be meaningful for all the honoras in the honoras that has been abandoned for many years , many years of suffering and suffering .
i read this list , and i read a friend loud , and i had to laugh at this time , and it was so ridiculous , but i just came up to the court , and i couldn &apos;t talk , and i had to stop reading and stop reading and start to this extent , and to the emotional fluctuation , so that it &apos;s uncomfortable .
now , a group of ara , which i learned a long time ago , which is a student who wanted to convey a group that wanted to convey more of the public , what she wanted to learn in the unseen , and so on the street , and try and explain to people what is .
there are 175 dresses in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10-foot tar venues and 12 bars that you could buy a large number of salts in your own dessession , in the unlikely case that the 175 is right for you .
and that was really , really , really , really , really , really , really bitter , and then you go into the phase of the phase , and you just dive it into a picture of where i asked myself to go after 10 thousand , and a half of those things were just kind of basic , underground , loving , collective papers , of course , whether this really should be great .
so what i &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as possible , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we have as part of an exception , a year ago . this is adjust , and it &apos;s a environment that is either in which you can locate or locally close to a huge data of visual data .
the first one , when you &apos;re going to be a child , as a baby , is that you take care of what you &apos;ve got , you know , what ? and if your parents allow you to play more or less in the deadlier , and you can play a little more like , the more curious , the curiosity , the earth , of course , your curiosity , of course .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i have this excerpt -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds . what it means is that there &apos;s about 600 million lives in a month . there &apos;s about 600,000 . most of you don &apos;t leave behind them .
bill bill gates : to run the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the big scientists that we &apos;ve done , we just need a few million . and when we &apos;ve done our materials in a reactor to make sure that it &apos;s reasonable , it &apos;s only 100 million in 100 million .
this works really , which is done in the academic , and we thought , well , o.k that we might also have done a webcam , which is a webcam , which is done by the lens , and then you have a microscope , which has a microscope that has about a hundred times .
and when i show you 600 newspapers , and they &apos;re showing up to 10 categories , or i &apos;m going to show you 400 times , and i &apos;m going to show you these 20 categories in 20 categories , and then i believe that i gave them more choice and better experience than i would have given you 400 if i gave them 600 , if i gave them 600 .
friday &apos;s friday , friday , god &apos;s work . frivolta &apos;s friday , &apos; s &apos; s &apos; s &apos; s &apos; s &apos; s &apos; s &apos; s &apos; s &apos; caution , friday . &apos; tfried fried friday . her friday . her friday , didn &apos;t think we &apos;re going to talk about this video , without this video , i hope .
i believe i believe a significant channel -- not the only one , but a significant contributor to that depression , and suicide , is that people have learned the disappointment because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain to themselves , they think it would be their fault .
the neolithic revolution that brought us the agriculture , and that moment where the season of the koran cerebral cortex , the poetry of the prosthese through the pristine revolution , and the hierarchy of hierarchy , and specialization , found only 10,000 years ago .
this is the one that , if you focus a laser beam , on a room , you can catch little particles in the air or in the liquid and then move it into this foster , so the one that &apos;s caught , so there &apos;s a kind of like a tractorial .
it would be great if we could take this paradigm of the normal paradigm against a different kind of strength or the strength of the strength to even give it a little bit more dangerous , exchange , so we can release the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their special and valuable skills to society .
you know , when michelangelo taught the moses , it means that he took the hammer and took him down to moss -- in fact , they can still see a little untension -- and said , &quot; chief chief ? why don &apos;t you spam ? &quot;
but if you &apos;re in 2011 today , in 2011 , you &apos;re going to buy a new color laser from the leading laser factors and print one side , this site has printed illumination on every page , into a pattern that &apos;s clearly tracking it on its back and forth .
i mean , my colleague with the assignment , assay you could take a lot more about the perceive and the many other wonderful things that you can perceive with , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we &apos;re talking about at the beginning , and that &apos;s the concrete environment .
now , the problem , the problem , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have sympathy for the difficulty of the hard-to-face , they look like ginitially , and they look sort of like the past , in the past , in the world , the real world , the real world . our world , progresses .
and then i tried this in my lab , and i tried to spend a little bit of time , and then i got so on , and i bought myself on ebay , and i bought a little n.n. analysis , which is trying to get a father , so that &apos;s what n.na can fingerie , and they &apos;re still going to do it .
and if you were to choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between the two types of self , and you need to think about how you decide this conflict , and it &apos;s not really obvious , because if you think about it in the sense of time , you &apos;re going to get an answer . and if you think about it in the sense of the brain , you might get another answer .
in the early &apos; 800s , i got a really amazing task when my professor at harvard asked if i was interested in haiti , and the secret to film societies that were filmed by the dumb strength of duvton and couton &apos;s couton , and that was used to make sure it was made to make biomes .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people are always asking me to tell me how i &apos;m going to deal with wishes , and i &apos;m going to give you a little bit : this one never fought for me , and i &apos;m always feeling very uncomfortable with trying to answer the people , and i believe , and i believe , why i understand why i understand .
and if i &apos;m going to translate that now , for example , in which i &apos;m going to think of as overwhelming selection , as a selection , in which it &apos;s all coming to me , i can do it in the detail , and i &apos;m saying , you know , transfer , i can also throw it up anywhere or buy somebody else , and so on .
i recommend all of you to read steves , or to look at the movie , so you can &apos;t just understand the wonderful interconnectedness that emerged between those two men , but also how music helped to create this music , and how it was the instrument when this game is allowed to accomplish , the mithmic , from the street .
down here in the image , you can see the lab , in leadership , so there &apos;s such a garage with all kinds of lab bruni , which is a group in paris , which is quite successful , and it &apos;s pretty interesting , and it &apos;s kind of interesting , because i want to run a project .
no biologist , for example , would claim that 50 percent or more of all species before die before , because it &apos;s not easy . and yet , this apocalypse to see the biodiversity of the biodiversity -- which is barely known as the optimistic aristology in the cultural area .
bbg : well , we haven &apos;t yet put ourselves on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting rules for the &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there &apos;s big interest and the people of the corporations in russia , india , china -- and i &apos;ve been here , and i &apos;ve talked about energy , and how it fits to the agenda .
the computer visions were given these images together to give them the real room , in which these records that were all made near the grassi in the canadian rockets , and they see elements here from sidias or pandias or pandemic and these things were all listed into each other .
and then , if you look at the software that we &apos;ve seen before , it &apos;s going to look at , you &apos;ll also understand why ninety-nine percent of our software today isn &apos;t intuitive or used to use , it &apos;s in a lot of ipad , or a lot of them , even though there &apos;s a lot of intuitive software .
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift from the responsibility for somebody who knows something about the name of somebody -- the name of the namibia -- is not too much , and therefore sick , in the best way , it &apos;s a constitution of the patient -- namely .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of a writing , pray , pray , mundy , . i fell into one of these two graves of the two that we all fall when we &apos;re working on , and it doesn &apos;t work , and you don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be a disaster . it &apos;s going to be the worst book that ever written .
we also have one of these same aggregation in the same size , as he says , in the hall , in the hall , to actually see the entire dynamic behavior of this net , where it looks like this one , and this is the back here , the large battery that &apos;s here , the big bath here , the entire rift with which we simulate the web .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical credical credibility that was believed that it was literally living in the walls of an artist -- about as much as the dobby , the house -- the outside , the artist , the work and the work with the kind of invisible work , and the result of the work .
if i &apos;m going to give you one thing today , it &apos;s that the whole data of the data that we consume is larger than the sum of its parts , and instead of thinking about information overlapping , i want you to think about how we can use information so that patterns and so we recognize the trends that we have never seen before .
so in a study that i did with somo benarseno and alandro , we did a study with people with the people who were all working for -- and these people were all collected in a collection where they were sharing their revenues for their plan .
and what &apos;s interesting about the historical footnote : when the mosquito fishermen got them up with these uses . the language changed over the centuries of allah , allah , allah , drought , olaerol√© , you know , you &apos;re still fighting over and over and over and over .
now , today , you need , if you want to win a race , actually something like this one -- something that &apos;s in real time , has a few thousand sensors that have information coming out of the car , and then you get this information on , and then you use this car to make things back up and back up in real time .
i was frightened , not because of it , but i was afraid that i could lose him that he could sing in one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship with him when i started talking about tons and pearo and other parts of the toxic dialects .
so , in fact , the fact that you remember the 20th century , in 300 years , will not remember his wars or technological innovation , but rather than a era of an era where we were against the destruction and the massive diversity of the biodiversity and cultural diversity in the earth , or the problem is not acceptable . so this is not the change .
i wrote this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which was the measurements in visual effects and computer effects in very new ways to shoot with realities , with realistic human expressions that had been made to be medicines , and the main ones should be all the main canyons . and the world should be cage .
i probably hear about the two girls who are still in girls , because i &apos;m listening to the generation that &apos;s probably supreme for this bad image , because i &apos;ve been studying hundreds of thousands of imneanderthals , i &apos;ve started studying carlings in carlboard school today , called high-tech school , which is today , i think .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a questionable answer in my lecture , who was a report . &#91; unclear &#93; &#91; unclear &#93; -- he said he would have heard a symphony , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and at the end of the day , there was a terrible sound .
do you know ? i think to allow a person to say he thinks he thinks he or she &apos;s like the vessel , how the essence and the food and the divine , creative , uncreative , infinite mysterious , is a little bit too small , to make a lot of a human race , the human race .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economically , and at the same time , the carbon dioxide says , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t matter that it didn &apos;t want any carbon dioxide , i wish it would do it , but i &apos;ll probably accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the forecast . &quot;
in fact , it &apos;s really like this one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , the one who says we had two reflections at two different surgeons , and the decision to choose , then the one who selects , the memory , the memory has less , and that &apos;s less bad and that &apos;s the surgeon , the surgeon is chosen .
you all know the healthy ones that know when you give a secret to the best friend of the cost , even though that one is waving into a shower and then you get caught and the best friend will confront a terrible conversation and a horrible discussion , if you &apos;re in the end of the bad thing , and you &apos;re going to be aware of that , you &apos;re never going to make a mistake like that .
you know , one of the great sensitivity in traveling and one of the nodes in the noble research is together with people who can still remember the old days . the past is still in the past , they feel at the wind , and they touch the rain in the rain , and they touch it in the tweet , they touch a few bites of the plants .
if you &apos;ve ever had the chance to work in a urban center , like our scott silver man as part of the program -- in fact , they all do -- you can see that the government , because of many different problems , including nevertheless , is that they &apos;re in their house .
so what &apos;s really nice about this is , if you do this , agriculture , gdp , gdp , is a hectar country with fifth avenue in favela , so it can take about a hundred thousand dollars and wait for a hundred thousand dollars to grow up , and make a chickens and vegetables and fish and fish .
we &apos;re at the threshold of the threshold , amazing events of many areas . and yet i really think that we should go back hundreds of years ago to find a time in progress that we &apos;ve struggled up in the progress that we &apos;ve been talking about these things , more than in front of us now .
so using color and contrast to change the lens of the individual images , photographers , photographers like depth , dumb colors , like deep crystals and colors , and disorders that we &apos;re leaving between the different images and gives you a single picture , even though a picture of them can reveal image can reveal .
if i had to go into a room with colleagues and ask her soundscape and ask her soundscape and tell you what i &apos;ve just told you , i probably wouldn &apos;t do that very much the end of the story before it really would be uncomfortable , someone would have a joke , you would forget the rest and the rest of the story .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good moment , your auditorium , you take your personal communications -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can throw a glimpse on a cake , you can &apos;t see that , because there &apos;s nothing else in the course of this talk for you to do .
a few years ago , the laser prize , the scientist inshinya yamanaka was taken for his research in which he took a peaceful , a fiddle , and through the manipulation of four genes that live in order to lead them to a pluripotent cell -- a potentially potentially potentially able to be able to become a cell in one body .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve made all the kinds of batteries that are produced , looked at the cars , the computer , cell phones , lamps , all for it , and i &apos;ve been using the amount of electronic energy that uses the world , so i found that all the batteries that we can produce are now producing less than 10 minutes .
now , let &apos;s take a step back to the big bang at the time of the big bang -- 14 years ago , the solar system , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs , maybe three to four billion years ago -- on the earth -- the first several million organisms , maybe a lot of a billion or 800 years ago -- and then the human species , which ended up in the last 30,000 years .
this is a reconstructor of cathedral &apos;s cathedral , who at the end of flickr with flickr , and they just give you a rectangle in flickr , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and in the workplace , and so on , each one of those colored surplus that model was discovered as a model of this model .
and yet , here in this country , in the old south of the old south , we &apos;re making people -- here &apos;s the risk of being judged by toss , when the victim is higher than if it &apos;s black , if 22 times higher , if the lift is black , and the black is white -- in the same states , in the states , in their bodies , in their bodies .
i was traveling with a young colleague 6,000 miles of char in china by sweet poet poet after la , and when i came to hate la , i saw the face behind the statistics . 60,000 monstra , who was transmitted by 1.2 million people , while the cultural revolution were brought out of the revolution .
and so , this is the idea , now , when you have all kinds of problems to invest in something that you &apos;ve only got to -- and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to come to be -- and that &apos;s not so clear . in fact , the cpc is not necessarily the worst report , and there are people in the rich world , who are looking at ipc and saying , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not a big deal . &quot;
we cleaned up the chromosome species of micro-species , and large , those two are as far apart as humans and mice , and we gave some extra genes to choose this chromosome , and we were able to destroy it with an enzymes to destroy all the proteins , and it was very amazing when we were in a cell -- and we estimated it -- and we &apos;re going to estimate our very smooth .
margaret garet mead , the great anthropologist in before she died , that it &apos;s the biggest fear that while we &apos;re moving towards a faculty , an imaginary world , we &apos;re not only moving the entire range of human imagination in a concert way , but we would see that one day , we &apos;ve forgotten one dream , and we &apos;ve ever forgotten it .
i &apos;d like to show you an original chimp of the original data of noah , and this is from a early prototype of photosynth that we &apos;ve been working on in the summer to show you what i believe it really is the pointy-view of this photosync technology , which is the photosynthetic technology , and this is not so obvious when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
in other words , sugar pills have shown in some studies of the measurements , the placebo effect , which is just because the person thinks what happens to you , is a pharmaceutical or a sort of painful ... in the management , for example , there &apos;s only one patient who believes , if the patient believes , an impact on the body , you call the placebo effect .
if one of them said no , it was the vetopaque that &apos;s got a completely cereal , and i spent 10 years on it , if i tried to assure if i had been studying my great engineering college to actually give me a shell away because all my father &apos;s been talking to him , you know , you &apos;ve got the money to spend money on a child .
i recently had a meeting like this when i met the extraordinary american dictum in ruth stone , who is now over 90 , but who was her entire life in diy . she told me that when she was growing up in the villages of virginia , she was working on the fields , she said , and she was going to feel like a poem about the landscape .
it means that a small child growing up in the faith that grows up in the belief that the mountain is a puppet , or her destiny , will determine a completely different person , and another relationship with this resource , or as a child growing up in montana , who &apos;s growing up in the mountain that a pile can be a pile .
usually my role is to explain to people how wonderful these new technologies are coming in , and i thought to be here , because i &apos;m here , i would tell you what i &apos;m really thinking about , and try to look back and understand what &apos;s going on here , and what &apos;s going to really going on with these incredible springs , and what &apos;s going to happen in front of us , which is the way that we can harmful .
and that would be your answer to the bjn borlg argument that if you use all this time and you use that energy to solve all the other targets , the other goals , the approximation of malaria , the fighting of malaria and so on and so on , there &apos;s a dummy resources of money , that if you spend all the money on it , there &apos;s better things that we can do .
now , these people have come online to be online , but they have illegal rejection by using trojans to cash money from our bank account , while we &apos;re doing our online banking , or keystone poles , our credit card recovery , and they &apos;ve collected information about the keyboard , as we buy over a computer online computer .
she &apos;s always coming back to montgombe for montgombe , where she test two friends of her elders . these elderly women , johns , the montgoma &apos;s bus boycott had organized -- an incredible joyd american -- and the american man , her husband , her husband , her husband , duro , dr. king .
and the ones and the ones that have come together with two builders , and they said , &quot; o.k , we make it easier and cheaper , and then open source open source of open source , hardware , electronics , this device , and they &apos;re actually now brought together to market , and they &apos;re actually brought down to market rates , and now the cheapest ones in the world .
and that made me think of another human being as my friends under the kwakiutl , who believe that these forests contain humidity from the cake and the prisoner smud and the canopy balconies that are at the northeast world , the mentor of their hair that they would participate in their hair .
a week before a week , vertebrates at the national academy of the academy of academia , for francis arni and wilnold , two scientists , who developed the independent techniques to work on the evolution of evolution , to work faster and want to lead proteins to an efficient proteins in a efficient , which is called &quot; arithmetic evolution . &quot; &amp; lt ; / i &amp; gt ;
now , as we go towards biology , and i want to take this metaphor , and because i want to take this metaphor , which is from synthetic biology , that biology is actually a science science , because the n.n.n.a code is a abstract code , which is not the same as a computer , because it &apos;s dynamic because it &apos;s matter , because it &apos;s dark matter , and it &apos;s not only cyber .
so bruce bruce brew brown , a famous design researcher at brighton university is so far to say that this media blocked the book , and the image , not the internet , etc . and so on , etc . , etc . and so , what we call the mass media today , is that these mass media and recapituates our media and our ability to have connected .
i &apos;m really happy to buy some happy people and companies and for-profit and profit profits -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will let me say that chris will never leave the right -- to buy the rights of the talk that she had just seen , who had a lot of content on it and didn &apos;t give a lot of content to what the subject was .
the idea of this sentence of reducing the transaction lives with drives drill from the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge , without having a challenge to pretend to prepare those impaired . as if my life was so successful , because i lost the potential of a prosthetic life with a progression of a progression , or how people would join me with my disability .
and when these individuals came and looked at who was the best proteins in the world , this wasn &apos;t a professor of involvement , there was no caltech student , it was somebody from england , a manchester , a woman who was working on the ceo &apos;s assistant in a ceos and worked at night at night , who was the best proteins of the world &apos;s dna .
now , of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. pbs , so i don &apos;t want to do the practices that i didn &apos;t want to do with the point that fifteen girls are going to be in the hospital in the second hospital , but he actually taught me to perform my daily practice with new eyes . so , a whole new experience of experience .
in the past year i went to model models for modeling , to do that , to do that , i &apos;ve tried to find myself in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they might have better or better ideas about how to help creative , how to deal with creative risks , with emotional risks that are connected to creativity .
so we have such a situation where , as we move forward , as our science continues , we have to stand around us , that categories that we had to be more stable for ianic categories , which were very simple in order to create insurgency , much more calories than we thought .
so at home , i went home and i went home with my wife at night and told her about it all , and we thought , &quot; well , once a second , if there &apos;s this technology , you can use your eyes to tap on things , then we should find a way , that he can drive a laser so that he can make a laser again , but it can be great . &quot;
so there are different , but the beautiful thing is that a million times as much energy as we say , and therefore there are , and so there &apos;s different kinds of pressure , but the beautiful thing is that a million times as much energy as energy as we say , we say , a coal-file molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the decrease , the radiation , the pressure and the potential cost , the potential is playing , the potential , so the impact , the impact on the country , and the other things , almost any other end .
