culture will .
thank you .
thank you .
hello !

thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
this was bad .
very similar thing .
i study this .
let patients help .
let patients help .
let patients help .
very different notion .
they actually hurt .
a japanese person .
you are ready ?
or maybe not .
it &apos;s true .
thanks , tom .
but many die .
good morning everybody .
it &apos;s awful .
what about 75 ?
five is yellow .
four is blue .
three is green .
it &apos;s horrible .
tremendously exciting .
no kidding .
not very sustainable .
and he says ...
yes , well ...
ta-da !
this is hard .
why do this ?
it &apos;s interesting .
there they are .
all right then .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
here &apos;s the thing .
tremendously challenging .
but it hadn &apos;t .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you so much .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you so much .
so i did .
so what happened ?
raw data .
like twice over .
i actually am .
he was waiting .
everybody loved me .
i felt great .
hold it up .
i went home .
not good enough .
they need us .
i was excited .
no counter offer .
and i have .
we eat organic .
we know that .
so what happened ?
that &apos;s super important .
it &apos;s brand new .
i &apos;m optimistic .
so it is connected .
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s really serious .
the world was changing .
what about bigger numbers ?
i paint as well .
it &apos;s a crisis .
robert gupta .
pretty good , right ?
i don &apos;t know .
and this was fascinating .
can i be honest ?
the farm &apos;s incredible .
how to do it ?
this is really exciting .
yeah , i know .
oh , that guy .
good job ! yeah !
i am a writer .
how does that happen ?
but you know what ?
the data came back .
and i understand that .
what did they do ?
just do your job .
this was the result .
here &apos;s another example .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
what happens is this .
now something on empathy .
he takes basically everything .
don &apos;t forget that .
it came back signed .
so she took it .
how amazing is that ?
it was really something .
what do you say ?
here &apos;s what happened .
what was the result ?
and take risks . &quot;
we &apos;re lovers .
that &apos;s not good .
we feel overcome .
but the point is ...
how did this happen ?
they really loved it .
this is a mountain .
this is a tree .
you get a mouth .
obi-wan .
right ? thank you .
that &apos;s his name .
the answer was no .
do not do that .
isn &apos;t that true ?
now , the whole event
you can be extraordinary .
peace . thank you .
we are the soil .
it doesn &apos;t exist .
we feel overwhelmed .
he eventually gets married .
it was grit .
we have each other .
sound familiar ? right .
there &apos;s no normal .
but i felt worse .
but we need more .
the economy needs them .
we savor life .
make room for it .
first saved voice message .
thank you . thanks .
people were going crazy .
there is no feed .
we have transmission challenges .
and the emotional part .
they are lost forever .
the orange tractor .
trust is the response .
hard problems are hard .
i pushed back .
i lost all hope .
we take photos constantly .
it could take months .
they didn &apos;t know .
we activate communities .
we have zero infrastructure .
so we did this .
and we are vulnerable .
and we &apos;re vulnerable .
why does this matter ?
let &apos;s call him don .
you could have done better .
and the answer is yes .
now , they are leaders .
he screamed a lot .
that &apos;s the whole idea .
so how can this be ?
how did you do that ?
the other one sees that .
now how did that happen ?
why do i do this ?
your call . your call .
why do we do that ?
dark urine . dark .
doesn &apos;t happen very much .
there &apos;s my boss .
i wanted to support them .
a major drawback .
yes , there it is .
i don &apos;t think so .
how do we know that ?
and what is that thing ?
can we do this differently ?
i &apos;m a performer .
and why is it true ?
those are their recordings .
and here are two patients .
this is the last one .
no , it didn &apos;t .
i turned to books .
fly away , cat .
i was never caught .
let me zoom in .
what &apos;s going on here ?
i was so shocked .
and i was very proud .
that was awkward .
actually , for 10 years .
not that catchy .
it &apos;s an extraordinary thing .
they had found a problem .
i see some first steps .
we short-change ourselves .
so where do we start ?
i &apos;m a process engineer .
but they settled .
this one &apos;s my favorite .
it &apos;s a female now .
inventing his own narrative .
and it goes like this .
so we went into it .
i can feel your noise .
so he pairs these up .
it &apos;s a rare condition .
who does the very best ?
and it &apos;s pretty amazing .
same thing , only bigger .
this is really cool . &quot;
and i was an artist .
want to feed the world ?
we talk about local food .
now , who &apos;s normal ?
it &apos;s a bad story .
he had had the experience .
it &apos;s not a country .
government ? forget about it !
so look at these two .
it took him three months .
it &apos;s not a system .
and there were a few .
it comforted her .
so it really is great .
happy , away i went .
and that &apos;s more limited .
so case closed , right ?
i started my own experiments .
what does that even mean ?
there &apos;s three sections .
it &apos;s not my data .
because , you know something ?
and here i am today .
thank you . thank you .
first we &apos;ve got population .
it doesn &apos;t see beauty .
the sun is rising .
leave that up to us .
and i always have been .
like that , you know .
and those days are gone .
he starts this new life .
here &apos;s what it said .
that &apos;s hollywood for you .
so how does this work ?
what &apos;s going on here ?
my dream was coming true .
it was a beautiful day .
we love farmers &apos; markets .
it is not 1961 .
so why did they go ?
these girls were so lucky .
what is it , then ?
this was the very first .
and here &apos;s me today .
these are only two countries .
secrets can take many forms .
what makes the heart unique ?
i was considered a radical .
i was facing the grave .
my wife came with me .
she heals with color .
and it actually means sad .
easy when you know how .
i live in south central .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
next , would be nuclear .
what defines a story ?
and that got me thinking .
but there was a problem .
okay . open your eyes .
it never stops coming .
then there &apos;s the danger .
i needed to go deeper .
we are in excellent company .
all of those a &apos;s .
and then i did it .
so i set up everything .
so i had an idea .
so they kill the lions .
just go and read her book .
so that &apos;s the good news .
i want to ask a question .
so , you can do it .
so let &apos;s have a look .
so let me remind you .
so be skeptical .
you know , is it rational ?
come on a journey with me .
these are just tricks .
i &apos;ve loved only two .
this happened around christmas .
but is that good evidence ?
very expensive real estate .
what makes his story different ?
how is this story different ?
maybe it was a poem .
everyone asks about the smell .
don &apos;t they sound incredible ?
so this is a wish .
they pretty much do nothing .
great memories are learned .
but i never got cast .
and then somebody complained .
this is south los angeles .
but what does it take ?
it doesn &apos;t face death .
raw data now . &quot;
and i tried something interesting .
finally , epic meaning .
this is an old study .
what else can they record ?
here &apos;s a guy from canada .
they actually make us worse off .
the truth is more like this .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
talk about getting by with nothing .
well , what does that mean ?
now , what does that mean ?
they speared each other .
why are you still standing there ?
what does she suffer from ?
we are going to be okay .
who cleans up after us ?
we see all the same symptoms .
so this is our reconstruction .
it will look something like this .
you can see all of this .
so , superman can fly .
that &apos;s all the bad news .
they don &apos;t want to change .
your average dog has that also .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
thank you for making your site .
one day they &apos;ll get here .
they &apos;re just practicing .
64 becomes 6,400 .
for example , the calculation .
absolutely . absolutely , i do .
there are . there always are .
let &apos;s call him don too .
this is a lot of volume .
so , here is what happens .
the flows have increased .
and the idea &apos;s pretty simple .
this is a woman from canada .
do the same thing at work .
but it &apos;s time to talk .
so let me summarize .
one is the body channel .
and so they &apos;re absolutely essential .
so what does all this mean ?
let &apos;s do something really simple .
so let &apos;s get started now .
she pulled up the cd .
the question was , where from ?
okay ? mmhmm ?
and he plays with this idea .
they want to ask me something .
they admire their work .
that &apos;s god , you know .
it makes them feel good . &quot;
his name is paul offit .
some have come from natural sciences .
it was really really quite profound .
i don &apos;t love that question .
this is an ecological network .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
it also has three big problems .
who &apos;s going to be sure ?
a little bit of multiplication .
this equation has four factors .
it &apos;s been constantly going up .
we made this game in 2007 .
it &apos;s part of our life .
don &apos;t be daunted .
it &apos;s a talking horse .
there &apos;s another pile of leaves .
so i should talk about art .
some people say it &apos;s happy .
and it was a huge success .
and there are risks , absolutely .
and it really changed the dynamic .
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; best in the business . &quot;
so that &apos;s a tough one .
okay , we can do that .
that does not hold for emotions .
it is a completely different notion .
you have not changed the story .
so try to meet that bar .
this is kim peek .
let me tell you a secret .
you hear it all the time .
it &apos;s a remarkable statistic .
it must always be in motion .
we got to our campsite .
that &apos;s one way to go .
for a year . a year .
but that &apos;s so unfair .
but lions are very clever .
and i &apos;ll tell you why .
now don &apos;t get me wrong .
that &apos;s 20 central parks .
it &apos;s about all of us .
i want to make them public .
and i will talk about this .
this person has never been born .
but they mean two different things .
everybody talks about happiness these days .
do you want them distressed ?
i believe he is selling hope .
that &apos;s a perfectly rational thing .
and i got pretty into it .
it was just three days away .
so i became a comic .
sherry brown got the part .
i didn &apos;t get the part .
no shakespeare .
my dream would never come true .
they are so easy to help .
one of them was this grandmother .
and everyone was doing the same .
see , i &apos;m an artist .
but it &apos;s actually a painting .
the book was published in 2009 .
and i was distraught .
we had a little natural experiment .
but that &apos;s not the case .
how sad are you right now ?
this was bigger than a drug .
for surgical teams .
we can &apos;t cure it all .
and that &apos;s what she does .
the first piece she eats .
you will see how that goes .
what does this mean for us ?
the idea is actually pretty simple .
three days of fun and music .
maybe no one &apos;s really crazy .
and many people found this amazing .
and it wasn &apos;t social intelligence .
and we were live , right ?
you know when to expect them .
could it be so simple though ?
we &apos;re proud of you . &quot;
it offers many insights .
but no adults liked the idea .
remi knows what love is .
so why did i do that ?
just because it sounds so good .
and why are these <unk> there ?
you can give somebody an idea .
the most important thing is passion .
but then we see extraordinary differences .
autonomy was our highest value .
it &apos;s just better than reality .
dead easy to give him respect .
and it &apos;s related to empathy .
so they elevated it .
how big a deal was this ?
don &apos;t worry about the numbers .
i also found my wife online .
so that &apos;s what she did .
that &apos;s my mom and dad .
64 multiplied by 75 .
what do you think happened then ?
so , i just started playing .
and one has come from music .
but what are your fish eating ?
&quot; absolutely , &quot; i said .
what do you think happens next ?
not everybody gets to do that .
i never would have expected that .
no expensive staff time required .
but most people don &apos;t agree .
we go on blind dates .
some of them committed suicide .
they were seeing something magical .
gamers don &apos;t sit around .
there &apos;s no models for them .
my big break came in 2010 .
they only hired perfect people .
college was imitating life .
but i like contingency plans .
so what happened to emma ?
it &apos;s much better than that .
we &apos;re working with local communities .
and i think there are three .
we might learn something unexpected .
but we &apos;re not so comfortable .
i call myself a body architect .
so i looked for quality information .
everyone &apos;s somewhere in the middle .
so , please forgive me .
we love small family farms .
they &apos;re feasting . &quot;
they literally flipped the switch .
a lot of arguments against it .
so the correlation is low .
we design unique elements into this .
he has a purpose in life .
i think these people are experts .
now thirdly , the task .
she needs to give it to us .
i &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
let &apos;s call him miguel .
doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
we need to get the message out .
now , this sounds crazy , right ?
and it &apos;s a very easy question .
you probably saw it on the news .
i think it &apos;s odious .
what do you want to do ? &quot;
so so much for the aim .
free at last ! free at last !
we could align ourselves with it .
this i thought i could handle .
a hundred and forty-seven .
it seemed to be following the conversation .
and so that &apos;s how they live .
so what &apos;s going to solve this ?
the data says it all the time .
okay , so let &apos;s review .
so , this is world without oil .
let me read you the entry .
what do these two have in common ?
it &apos;s just the way it is .
now there &apos;s google body browser .
thank you so much . thank you .
and there are several reasons for this .
next is sylvia slater .
so planning has this blind spot .
she studied health care like me .
she kind of set us up .
no adults believed i was serious .
it was very time-consuming .
and let me begin with one example .
why not think about it this way ?
it &apos;s nothing if not ambitious .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away .
all of these are consuming questions .
they &apos;re homelands of somebody .
so let &apos;s look at the numbers .
and then follow me into your kitchen .
take a moment to say thank you .
we &apos;re going to be okay . &quot;
nobody around to teach me ? fine .
they kill our livestock .
it &apos;s about time . thank you .
can we see it in full 3d ?
she also had duplicates .
that seemed pretty darn unlikely .
and the garden , it was beautiful .
it &apos;s 150 feet by 10 feet .
that &apos;s a little bit scary .
that would be really our only choice .
but the principle is exactly the same .
now why ? you can call them .
and he emailed me this picture .
you can see some internal organs .
then it &apos;s going to show inside .
get yourself to a specialist center .
her boyfriend was with her .
i &apos;m an extreme example of this .
i can see it in their eyes .
but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
and i thought about this concept of ,
you can see every step i take .
who sends whom a text message ?
hi . this is my mobile phone .
but enormously different motivations here .
you hear about it all the time .
and it &apos;s been slow to spread .
we are not so much in control .
that robot put on a great show .
people want to customize their lives .
and then we unplugged .
him giving me respect ? slightly different .
and i thank you for your attention .
they didn &apos;t like this at all .
now we did a very simple experiment .
and they started settling out .
i &apos;ll get my sleeve back .
my other great passion is the environment .
so my parents would go to dinner .
next is maynard sipes .
this is nell remmel .
this isn &apos;t photoshopped .
and that can make a big difference .
you know science isn &apos;t a company .
no one &apos;s ever said that before .
and he actually says it that way .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
and so that got me very excited .
he pointed at the algae .
the chef had overcooked it .
and so that &apos;s a big challenge .
this is true . i believe this .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
he said -- think about this one .
everyone is just a little bit mad .
sylvia &apos;s interested in art training .
but there &apos;s another reason as well .
so , paul &apos;s a terrorist .
we talk about it ambivalently .
so with that , i thank you .
i could draw . i could paint .
i almost never cook with it .
they flooded the canals .
actually his name is miguel .
it is kind of a crazy idea .
they are building an epic story .
five million people use it every month .
maybe we can see it as change .
my friend got to come with me .
these flows are increasing very rapidly .
these are cell phones of the future .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
would i have become a terrorist ?
he is introduced to this young woman .
maybe a year passes , nothing .
eleven . it &apos;s not bad .
maybe we even know a baker .
the forest was sparkling .
so may books be always with you .
the bible is interesting , but strange .
what would such a future look like ?
they are bird-blending machines .
they are far from being extinct .
they are hardly monogamous .
but i didn &apos;t handle it .
this is a completely unsustainable pattern .
and the problem is not technology itself .
it &apos;s about creating a social impact .
so mohamed saw an opportunity .
they sought people like him out .
i want more quests like that .
but that &apos;s not how it happens .
it did not start that trend .
do you trust fishmongers ?
i don &apos;t have an overview .
do you remember what it was ? &quot;
i need you to actually see this .
jealousy likes photos .
jealousy likes details .
jealousy likes information .
it &apos;s the power of patient networks .
and i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
all this is possible with this information .
every time i use my mobile phone ?
we don &apos;t work from offices .
huge effect here of starbucks .
skill two is devise solutions .
now fast-forward to 2012 .
i embody the central paradox .
jargon is a big one .
so that &apos;s the experiment we did .
and this can take quite a while .
i &apos;ll say bye for now .
maybe i can add quickly this way .
this was just installed last month .
so he and mom went to dinner .
and we clean them up with technology .
this is something from a novel .
comparative reading actually is nothing new .
that &apos;s procrastination .
how does light look in slow motion ?
today i have just one request .
i even went through an identity crisis .
so we started retouching photos .
we &apos;re pale , gray creatures .
you know ? you can be anything .
but you have to maintain it .
but it is not only about me .
he wasn &apos;t alone when he started .
it &apos;s a terrible design strategy actually .
we have everything we need to start .
we &apos;re smitten with technology .
we need to go far , quickly .
no breaking into your circulatory system .
we can see tendons and muscles .
it &apos;s been successful beyond our dreams .
i didn &apos;t feel sick at all .
and there were actually two of these .
and everyone &apos;s somewhere in the middle .
well the range is quite a bit .
and so this is what i did .
music is medicine . music changes us .
this has nothing to do with science .
now , that blew my mind .
people need to feel good about it .
on one day , everybody would eat .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
we choose between memories of experiences .
this is an inherited disorder .
we certainly need one to succeed .
that &apos;s our fuel to begin with .
if you burn coal , no .
we actually don &apos;t choose between experiences .
clearly , patient b suffered more .
so don &apos;t worry about climate change .
we started this over 15 years ago .
everybody needs a fishbowl .
our magazines are read by millions .
we remember when we are deeply engaged .
so i started reading books in pairs .
she &apos;s not north korean . &quot;
the first principle of aid is respect .
or are they negatively correlated ?
and they made extra problems for us .
we live in jealous times .
where does medical ability end and start ?
and that was played by my mom .
he shook his head , no .
the disaster is for that two billion .
what should our report card look like ?
here we have a very basic service .
third : escalation of expectations .
we go through initiation rites .
i call these eight characters radicals .
but his story takes a different route .
what are they failing to learn ?
he was only three at the time .
they work because they make you work .
disability is as visual as race .
i have cerebral palsy !
and that &apos;s a belief that i share .
and then they execute on it .
we vanquished it . puff .
my parents are closing in on 80 .
so , what do we have to do ?
and the answer is really straightforward .
and this is felix , actually .
there are some that are much more spatial .
he has a selective one , though .
and so this became a very famous study .
let &apos;s make it kogi . &quot;
oh , it &apos;s so familiar to me .
i &apos;m going to do some cuts .
i &apos;m going to do some demonstrations .
grit is having stamina .
they &apos;re not under nda either .
you think they can &apos;t possibly exist .
people gave money to homeless people .
it &apos;s about repowering america .
repower america . find out more .
that &apos;s the real zipper .
sunlight and co2 is one method ...
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight .
there were no jobs , no opportunities .
bakers wear funny white hats .
we don &apos;t companies patenting life .
thinking , you know , two percent .
c.p. is not genetic .
plus you get strawberries .
the death rates fell 47 percent .
but they &apos;re less likely to stick .
not one team had a standing structure .
and this is 22 ft. long .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the street .
you have to create a new profession .
it seemed to be looking in her eyes .
so heather &apos;s going to like me .
i was already up at 4.4 .
so it doesn &apos;t matter whatsoever .
and empathy has sort of two qualities .
so there are two interesting parts about this .
this is the launch of my book .
and what do they do with that money ?
i &apos;m going to do some surgery here .
this shows a lot of internal structures .
and it was snowing that day .
what did google come out with this year ?
and i love to dig a hole .
you &apos;ve got to express support for them .
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s vanished .
so , this crazy story might be true .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
and there are also tons of collaborators .
so we have some gamers among us .
you have that much uncertainty .
most of them don &apos;t leave a trace .
here , he &apos;s bringing the sun out .
and so , the question becomes , how ?
i wear jeans almost all the time .
do you know what i &apos;m talking about ?
and that title was &quot; president . &quot;
you don &apos;t get any money from that .
you hear about it on your television sets .
so , consider this really interesting statistic .
we just have that natural way of seeing .
and this one had to get broken up .
he has all these discussions with their family .
and this piece is &quot; frost . &quot;
one is a flash of white light .
there &apos;s world records on this as well .
architects and engineers , thankfully .
not even the truth will set them free .
and i see greg lemond now .
so , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
one billion people will go hungry today .
no one could give me a straight answer .
it &apos;s hard to overstate the destruction .
and even lomborg has changed .
these are our virtuoso gamers .
and when we do this , who knows ?
what ? that really flipped me out .
and the object of this is quite simple .
that image reminded me of something .
this is an annual melting river .
they laughed more than you guys are .
their problem is that they have too little .
the official dogma of what ?
on the left , we have a woman .
three trees together , we create the forest .
this is a person going for a walk .
you can all give your own examples there .
what &apos;s the next one on your list ?
no one knows what the hell we do .
he has the most impeccable memory .
some people just wanted to call him king .
and there is a slight downturn .
now i put a bass line in .
this is the machine below geneva .
so we have gone through almost 30 characters .
two suns together , prosperous .
the aim is to have more trust .
secondly , what about the aim ?
we should really pray for her . &quot;
that &apos;s really bad for the worker .
and what does jealousy like ?
i &apos;m always the one taking the picture .
it &apos;s really become sacred to us .
and there it was , a great revolution .
all this is possible with your mobile phone .
the technologies do not exist to do that .
so the first way that we did this .
next is ginger cheshire .
everyone just has a piece of the care .
we can &apos;t do it all by ourselves .
i &apos;m at seven and a half years .
we had to get past the nice problem .
the project aim is really quite simple .
so it &apos;s actually fairly simple for them .
and so they &apos;re bringing in the box .
right . you know what i &apos;m saying .
so we call this anatomage table .
what else do we know about the heart ?
we opened the fist section in 2009 .
it turns out we were wrong on that .
and then it was abandoned .
this is from july , 1969 .
my name is joshua walters .
there &apos;s never been a time like this .
we have helped to start 40,000 businesses .
this should be the first principle of aid .
but we can make it possible for most .
we were exploring different aspects of ourselves .
and she gets cucumber again .
we do the same task with elephants .
and the other one is empathy and compassion .
well heart cells are pretty greedy .
no . i wrote it in a month .
almost all patients are incurable . &quot;
when i got out i had a choice .
she &apos;s a very serious swiss artist .
he draws sticks real good . &quot;
another example : a little bit more mathematical .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
everybody would like to make people happier .
we talk about drowning in data .
you can jump right into a specific issue .
you can drill into a particular year .
how are you going to feed the world ?
do they do that for the children ? &quot;
i fell out of love with this fish .
we need to go for more research funding .
this is the one with the greatest impact .
the internet and its services are a miracle .
the second factor is the services we use .
challenge yourself to see how you would survive .
and on the next day they would eat .
no . i &apos;m serious . i am .
so , we can give ourselves a gift .
conflict is the genesis of creation .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
and i kept speaking out about the environment .
patients are such an underutilized resource .
how much depends on how lucky you are .
and why ? genetically engineered food .
there wasn &apos;t any cantaloupe .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
they did it by draining the land .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
if this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
so here we have some natural fireflies .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
dosage has something to do with this .
so to him , they were just blocks .
the permanent ice is marked in red .
and his whole work process changed after that .
you have to fight for it every day .
they simply listen and then begin to speak .
i &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
at that point i also had a son .
well , we can do that for ourselves .
do you know britney spears ? &quot;
we could go to mars if we want .
and now i can stand on my head .
and their work lets us do our work .
they wear a uniform in many cities .
i wanted to understand who takes the job .
jealousy is exhausting .
that &apos;s a topic for a different day .
well you can see where this is going .
you &apos;re working on other electrical inventions .
that means they can be self-administered .
i gave out homework assignments .
my dad finished dinner early that evening .
everyone take their vitamins this morning ?
does anyone even know what those things are ?
and that &apos;s why i made the movie .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
they reversed the flow of water .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
if you burn natural gas , no .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
time has very little impact on this story .
which is great , because we need that .
156 nations carry our television channel .
two women together , they have an argument .
knock knock . is anyone home ?
let me give you a simple commercial example .
so far it &apos;s cost about 150 million .
problem was the experiment went haywire .
this is a guy called e.p .
so , we used to solve big problems .
but there were exceptions to the rule .
so i started a research project with them .
freud would write about this later .
a map actually carries somebody &apos;s view .
where am i from ? who am i ?
i got tired of seeing this happening .
nobody started a company alone . no one .
probably not , but people like me do .
compare that to this woman from uganda .
and what that means is there &apos;s hope .
she tests a rock now against the wall .
wish i could build my muscle this fast .
otherwise , go bother somebody else today .
it totally dominated her imagination for months .
sometimes we choose not to solve big problems .
we forget how pitiless he is .
we forget how harsh his vision was .
that is me playing my imaginary piano .
they thought it was tried and tested .
because this time it wasn &apos;t coming up .
my son &apos;s birth is on this camera .
we knew it wasn &apos;t lung cancer .
i &apos;m under the river with those fish .
we object to genetically engineered food .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing you own .
you know , what are the lessons learned ?
and it completely changed how i do movies .
and , finally , this storage problem .
patents are very difficult to overturn .
a has these benefits , and these risks .
he started a motorbike company .
how does dorothy win her movie ?
bakers have flour on their hands .
and then there &apos;s the stigma .
jealousy baffles me .
it &apos;s about knowing you &apos;re not alone .
so what is the problem with vultures ?
we did not prioritize right .
and this was my first time in afghanistan .
and i figured , this has to stop .
that &apos;s right , older people are happy .
doctors and medicine made no difference at all .
this is a list of the core team .
i believe there &apos;s an evolved morality .
seriously -- doomed , doomed !
you read about it in your newspapers .
and so that &apos;s how this all operates .
so let me give you a few examples here .
now i &apos;m going to step back in history .
that &apos;s headed up to about nine billion .
it might sound like it &apos;s a bad thing .
in other domains -- the world of communications .
they &apos;re throwing it up in the air .
and so that &apos;s how they bring it in .
i &apos;m going to make a cut right there .
let me give you good close look at this .
and if not , do your dance anyhow .
now this cartoon makes a lot of points .
but you see , it &apos;s still generic .
disgraceful . disgraceful .
are we soaking up that story ?
instead , everything we touched we killed .
this is on the street for a reason .
it fell in every hospital it went into .
it shouldn &apos;t take away from other things .
please don &apos;t tell me i &apos;m normal .
these north koreans were not so lucky .
and we even text at funerals .
so you could feel good about selling it .
and so , we need energy miracles .
i was a girl with c.p .
maybe one of you sent this one in .
but i really began to love cars then .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
also , these are intermittent sources .
new investments to create high-paying jobs .
now you can learn three interesting things from this .
because , does anyone have measles here ?
how do we keep fish on our menus ?
so , we &apos;ve got big cost challenges here .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
what we want to do is make the future .
they divided the entire kingdom in half .
now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
there is no sitting around wringing your hands .
and the form has something to do with it .
i hold the knife in my hand .
so that &apos;s reassuring , you know .
here &apos;s this couple on the hamptons .
that &apos;s the work that stands before us .
i was like , this is unbelievable .
hello , tedwomen , what &apos;s up .
but there are a lot of challenges for this .
it activates the same areas in the brain .
and so empathy has basically two channels .
these pictures mean more to me than you know .
and after one week , it &apos;s beating .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
and it just disturbed me so much ...
they were exactly like the people in this room .
you hope you don &apos;t need to do that .
that was the first upright primate .
thank you danny kahneman .
there seems to be a discrepancy .
this is hitting the reservoirs .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all those things .
it &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
it &apos;s one tragedy compounding another .
we take less notice of trivial matters .
a person behind japan , what do we get ?
they don &apos;t work as they &apos;re supposed to .
the honest answer is , i don &apos;t know .
this is how stuff is made memorable .
i met a host of really interesting people .
hello , tedwomen , what is up ?
i want to believe that paulie was right .
i wanted to get to know them as individuals .
the novel is very good on this point .
you &apos;re deciding your life right now .
thinking about death clarifies your life .
something to do with words , i assume .
we had a victory on our hands .
otherwise they don &apos;t come and talk to you .
the numbers won &apos;t determine the outcome .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
it &apos;s shaping a new way of being .
this is a model of my aorta .
and you can see that they &apos;re synchronized .
so here &apos;s to another day at the office .
so we call this the slicer mode .
it &apos;s amazing that these cells beat at all .
let &apos;s take the example of electrical stimulation .
in fact , they &apos;re a ton of fun .
this is the advice your doctor gives you .
they have been saying that since the 1970s .
next is by vera sokolova .
let &apos;s have a look at the third question .
and here is one of my paintings .
or look at the foreign word and the sounds .
here are three questions drawn from my work .
what &apos;s the feed conversion ratio ? &quot;
i literally grew up with the ford motor company .
you see , that &apos;s the immune system .
next , this is by thomas swifton .
and that &apos;s the symbol of their culture .
and he pairs these up with paintings .
six is a tiny and very sad black hole .
because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
ask questions , demand proof , demand evidence .
and this took me awhile to figure out .
think about that . it &apos;s an incredible fact .
my grandparents pushed that number to 70 .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
and we had the same result with an audience .
feasting ? i was totally confused .
now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
blissful productivity . i love it .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
and the eyebrows up is surprise .
well let me work up some blood for you .
how &apos;s that look out there ? pretty good .
his name is dr. pizzutillo .
and they will feel they made the right decision .
there &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
but we &apos;re beginning to see a sea change .
so this is what the supermarket is like .
every large image is the beginning of a section .
yeah , on broadway . it &apos;s crazy .
okay . think of this as extreme self-motivation .
and this is a classic gaming emotion .
he wanted to capture the emotion of gaming .
and as i move around my finger shifts .
above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
now i &apos;ll put some percussion in .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
his village is near mogadishu .
it &apos;s not what i would aim at .
but there actually are no shortcuts .
the bodies can &apos;t be properly buried .
&quot; yo , is she retarded ? &quot;
well i think you probably already have the picture .
they are almost a form of reassurance .
now highsmith is a particular favorite of mine .
here &apos;s a story about how that can go .
and my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
but there &apos;s also something funny going on here .
they got their title of respectability .
and , you know , it could have worked .
and let that be your weapon of choice .
can they really store all this information about us ?
i can do this . i can change this .
the other pictures are of my very ill grandmother .
it doesn &apos;t have to be always dissection .
have you ever wanted to write a novel ?
and they &apos;re going to break ground in may .
and these efforts , i think , are great .
how do you get from connection to isolation ?
sixteen empty handicapped spaces .
because , i mean , let &apos;s be real .
books banned in china , of course .
so i was determined to find another calling .
i started to imagine what this would look like .
so i grew up hating lions so much .
but this is the geography of self .
and so the senate won in the end .
we might produce the next george washington carver .
what can you do ? can you make it ?
they were already drowning in manure .
but this is only one half of the story .
and we did the exact same thing as before .
could we design a checklist for surgery ?
he didn &apos;t see it in his own patients .
for each american , it &apos;s about 20 tons .
and some people think that &apos;s a good thing .
i &apos;m back here on the ted stage again .
&quot; that &apos;s me , my husband and son .
and this is my postcard collection today .
ok , i &apos;m going to do another cut .
you know , we &apos;ve come a long way .
the phone rang and it was my doctor .
a few weeks later , woodstock happened .
it &apos;s a multiplication of two prime numbers .
so now they understand the value of prototyping .
they manage the process , they understand the process .
we made it over the last 11,000 years .
we didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the ones who make scientific arguments are very few .
&quot; look at their bellies , pink .
there are 10,000 species of birds in the world .
one of them got caught up in the water .
why in the hell would they not okay this ?
so i figured that the problem is the solution .
there is a problem with community meetings .
you have to think about things like pause points .
getting that text was like getting a hug .
so it &apos;s quite a difficult structure to produce .
and i feel like i &apos;ve just got started .
and we &apos;ve already started construction on section two .
well thank you . that shot the timing .
this is by jason birdsong .
this project is called &quot; love nests . &quot;
so i should start to talk about these guys .
it &apos;s ideology , it &apos;s not science .
i have tap-danced on broadway .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
this is something that has to get to zero .
so , it &apos;s not just about the words .
and there have been other efforts along those lines .
i look forward to talking with all of you .
so here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
however there is a political battle in our country .
it caused immense celebration in the control room .
three together , that &apos;s sparkles .
two fires together , i get really hot .
who are these guys ? what are they learning ?
and that would be a perfectly sensible response .
do you trust elementary school teachers ? &quot;
are they smarter than the rest of us ?
in fact , i have just an average memory .
some , fewer still , have come from business .
we got dirty , and we loved it .
food is the problem and food is the solution .
hold your phones up , hold your phones up !
maybe you have something in mind , maybe not .
study after study is coming to the same conclusion .
start thinking of solitude as a good thing .
in the medical world they look up at plans .
the thought of the surgery was not attractive .
humans yawn when others yawn .
otherwise they wouldn &apos;t be pulling so hard .
so our doctors said these are eye candies .
and bless yourself . thank you very much .
i had one . my leg eventually snapped .
we did the exercise again with the same students .
we got rid of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
vultures also have tremendous historical significance .
now , that &apos;s just an insurance policy .
gamers are super-empowered hopeful individuals .
i know what people think when they see this .
there is a lot of happiness coaching .
now , this is an interactive cartoon application .
but that &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
the fact is , coal isn &apos;t dirty .
but the volumes are much larger than ever .
put a mouth inside the door , asking questions .
there &apos;s nothing like it in the land . &quot;
mohamed is not simply selling flowers .
and you can train young people to be entrepreneurs .
the next minute they &apos;re on the same side .
i don &apos;t understand where the idea came from .
where are the twentysomethings here ?
eventually , our initiative was adopted and successful .
please -- don &apos;t tell me i &apos;m normal .
they have been associated in ancient egyptian culture .
am i south korean or north korean ?
most people think that &apos;s down to the metal .
they own 26 square miles of vacant lots .
so what you do -- you shut up .
but it &apos;s not , it &apos;s early days .
but soon the idea began spreading virally .
and that was true until i got to college .
so what happens is you dance on the grave .
because they have special skills of facilitation .
that , to me , mostly is a waste .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with most of these things .
i don &apos;t understand why i was never caught .
because mps do not keep the environment clean .
the ripples should be moving towards us .
and that is what medicine can feel like sometimes .
and this piece : those aren &apos;t actually leaves .
which is one of the best compliments ever .
we don &apos;t want companies owning seeds .
and it did . and we created magic again .
that would power the u.s. for hundreds of years .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
aden saw an opportunity and seized it .
by making friends with everybody and being a leader .
do you trust politicians ? do you trust teachers ?
these people must be freaks of nature .
it mostly explains what &apos;s wrong with silicon valley .
but they don &apos;t solve humanity &apos;s big problems .
but our two hands still remain outside the screen .
she was a 26-year-old woman named alex .
so , i &apos;m going to wrap up now .
and none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality .
they &apos;re all on their way back underground now .
but here &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to be thinking .
and the world we now live in looks like this .
so let &apos;s pull up , now , something else .
now i &apos;d like to introduce you to my brothers .
it was like the foreman of the jury .
so they have a whole bucket full of them .
and i have all sorts of little props here .
and everyone in this room has to get into it .
i &apos;m going to go ahead and select government .
second , what economists call &quot; opportunity costs . &quot;
and i think it makes the world look like this .
but those are all the roads in the u.s .
so , the living give birth to the spirits .
so , let me give you a little peek .
oh , so jesus , what a thought !
now , i understand it . i do understand it .
thanks so much . max little , everybody .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with big , crazy challenges .
people who spent money on themselves , nothing happened .
soon my crazy idea didn &apos;t seem so crazy .
&quot; your mic wasn &apos;t off during sound check .
and by 1980 , the last train rode .
i thought , let &apos;s up the ante once .
well , i think number one is curiosity .
they are basically aliens right here on earth .
an energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
i think there &apos;s a big lesson in that .
i also thought , how to close the building ?
nasa even has the outline of a plan .
in a month , there are about 600,000 .
i shut up , and listen to them . &quot;
and it ruins their social relationships , in fact .
this article &apos;s about how their lives get ruined .
skill one , find where your failures are .
empathy is my main topic at the moment of research .
and this has been designed by renzo piano .
so they came up with dig jigs .
it &apos;s going to be two years of studio work .
i &apos;m just going to make the whole thing myself .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
instead , let &apos;s look to the ecological model .
so , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
we do not want to try to predict the future .
and on the next day , everybody would play games .
thank you . i &apos;ve got a question for you .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
if you want to go far , go together . &quot;
if your job is to dance , do your dance .
not just bad , but the worst book ever written .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m supposed to do .
and who &apos;s going to earn the most money ?
oh , yay ! y &apos;all &apos;s awesome .
they &apos;re our natural garbage collectors .
this was a life as a craftsman .
and they have to pick one of the two colors .
but now we &apos;re going to make it more difficult .
so this is anatomage table . thank you .
and then you can see the inside of the heart .
so i went in for an ultrasound .
and i &apos;m going to create this in two years .
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix it .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
no one had asked this question in his community before .
my daughter &apos;s 20 . she &apos;s a college student .
the other one needs to give a rock to us .
but it shows the intelligence that the elephants have .
so it &apos;s what we call freeloading .
so these are the pillars of morality .
and don &apos;t let them give you anything else first .
the next , this is by sam sandy .
the next artist is hazel clausen .
he can read a novel or two a day .
is it a happy word , or a sad word ?
so let me narrow the choices down to two .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand it .
that &apos;s fantastic . i love big placebo .
and i also ask myself , does it really work ?
we talk about the curse of information overload .
but i didn &apos;t let that daunt me .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s tired .
which is the history of who invented games and why .
500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something .
it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination .
i &apos;ve been making games online now for 10 years .
normally now , i would take the needle out .
it was summer time . i had shorts on .
we had to take them out , which we did .
a lot of these systems have the converse effect .
the weight takes a long time to get used to .
this crowd is going to be fine , i think .
and what about some still-life photography ?
and i &apos;m like , &quot; come on , really ?
this old man &apos;s grandfather refused to go .
the teachers didn &apos;t know a switch had been made .
you &apos;re teaching them to open doors for themselves .
thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
i can rearrange the sequence while it plays .
now he &apos;s brought a tractor into the scene .
and they can also sense their motion and tilt .
go bother leonard cohen . &quot;
and instead of panicking , he just stopped .
everyone knew your genius was kind of lame .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
these are pictures over about a six-second period .
initially , all we did was autograph it .
yes . what this is really doing is discovering .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
&quot; i took my girlfriend out for dinner .
a language is a flash of the human spirit .
the ethnosphere is humanity &apos;s great legacy .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard of this .
it came to be known as the memory palace .
and i learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff .
imagine yourself standing outside the front door of your home .
i &apos;d like to invite you to close your eyes .
god knows , we don &apos;t lack for the challenges .
take tom ripley , her most famous character .
it &apos;s a story about a woman named emma .
so how did my team at mit create this camera ?
we need to work with governments in regional levels .
i want to challenge that . do you know why ?
we had an amazing local woman who guided us .
these are 35,830 lines of information .
you can see , it &apos;s quite a complex structure .
they clean up carcasses right to the bone .
&quot; i &apos;m helping the north korean people . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m not helping you , &quot; he said .
it could take an hour . it could take weeks .
so luckily i brought an outfit change .
i grew up there . i raised my sons there .
and this is how i decided to maintain it .
who in the room has a mobile phone with you ?
first , you have to offer them confidentiality .
we &apos;ve done it in 300 communities around the world .
and of course , everything in africa grew beautifully .
and we luckily have an opportunity for you .
it &apos;s like calling in the cavalry .
they simply want to do whatever they &apos;ve done before .
our disciplinary conventions were funny as well .
i &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
and so they also reconcile with sex .
infringement is a lot easier to disprove .
or the way that we attract sexual partners ?
&quot; dear birthmother , i have great parents .
this is one of my favorite features in section one .
and that &apos;s a huge waste of time and resources .
so you can click on things and remove it .
now recently , there &apos;s been development in this field .
and there &apos;s a book -- john gartner .
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
we don &apos;t make money at these damn shows .
they live in an environment of chemosynthesis .
you know , i was a real science geek .
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish .
that really is very important , that we get there .
and i hated these bands more than anything .
and this is another way to learn anatomy .
we thought it would cost 100 million dollars to build .
of course , i had no intention of doing that .
so at that point we knew that it was cancer .
how much depends on where you fall in the spectrum .
this is from estelle willoughsby .
the sun rises , and it melts away .
i &apos;m just showing the new york times website here .
and every evening , they fly 150 miles back .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
in the nuclear space , there are other innovators .
well , again , it should have the two elements .
so let &apos;s think , how should we measure ourselves ?
there will be too much rain , not enough rain .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explained it .
on the left , you see our femto-camera .
it has moments of experience , one after the other .
this is a major mechanism of evolution right here .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
&quot; sharing knowledge is the greatest of all callings .
they had never really thought about starting up a business .
i brought together about 90 young somali leaders .
her favorite character was glinda , of course .
they are the first guardians of public health .
that &apos;s why instagram is such a hit .
my parents wanted me to become an engineer like them .
but my tiger mother said , &quot; no . &quot;
but now you don &apos;t have to worry about it .
this is not my opinion . these are the facts .
raise your hand if you &apos;re in your 20s .
so i didn &apos;t give up . i continued .
some people were disappointed there was not poetry .
we were creating visual imagery provoking human evolution .
and i can change my cut to see different parts .
now is my book the next great american novel ?
i mean , she knows i &apos;m not a dog .
that meant it was metastasized from somewhere .
so i thought , a biennial needs artists .
so what do you think happened to these design students ?
and for nathaniel , music is sanity .
diphtheria , rubella , polio ...
i was there not long ago with miguel .
there is always something specific and important to be done .
someone who didn &apos;t have a childhood is out there .
see , dr. kean made that shift in thinking .
i mean i &apos;ve rarely seen lines so flat .

and you know what my response to all of that is ?
and we &apos;ve tracked them for the three years since .
oh , you &apos;ve heard of that . okay . good .
so again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
and the world we used to live in looked like this .

i started studying for the university entrance exam .
hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
and i started talking to a few of the competitors .
so you got this scholarship . yep .

it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all on the web .
here &apos;s the updated version of this entry .
antonyms , healthy , strong , capable . &quot;
he had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
so , i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
this is one of them , part of one of them .
so , we &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
this is my supermarket . not such a big one .
i &apos;m like , &quot; what ? no . why ? &quot;
you don &apos;t get a chance to mess it up .
anyway , this is the way the numbers unfolded .
frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday .
i believe this and i feel that we must teach it .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
and we can just navigate in this very simple way .
these young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities .
two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff .
even a shattered dream can do that for you .
so i had to find a way of solving this problem .
some people got this slip of paper and 20 dollars .
i met an actual cowboy , by the way .
and she gets a grape and she eats it .
so the one who makes the choices always gets a reward .
then the next one is the pro-social token .
it looks like our table also can transform gender , too .
this is a big one , and it won &apos;t wait .
and i found that this was shockingly fun .
but what we saw -- this is an mri image .
some of our talks today , we still act like that .
and after this one , there &apos;s 77 other artists .
and actually this is my aunt irene .
and nabokov was himself synesthetic .
she wasn &apos;t going to vaccinate her kid against polio .
this tool that i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
and then on the next day , they would play games .
it will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers .
and , but of course , actually , it did click .
and i tend to think of it like my shadow .
it just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
we reconditioned them all , fixed them .
so , this looks like a basketball playoff .
nowadays , exile has turned into getting out .
these are all really good ideas that will move us forward .
i could be parking right in front of my building . &quot;
the official dogma of all western industrial societies .
you have a model that emerges of the entire earth .
obi-wan kenobi and glinda .

they &apos;ve expanded and enriched our lives .
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education .
a day , a week ? actually , a whole year .

we &apos;re starting to sell electric cars , which is great .
it &apos;s a line from a poem by john keats .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health care system sucks .
what about polio ? let &apos;s have that . why not ?
you can just say a few names and people will understand .
you &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
and so , i actually made a kind of curious decision .
that &apos;s not a business , and it isn &apos;t agriculture .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
that &apos;s a key element of making that report card .
now , the world today has 6.8 billion people .
now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .

sometimes at sea for 2-3 months at a time .
which brings us to skill number two a system has .
so this is absolutely personalized medicine at its best really .
we also recently published an experiment you may have heard about .
and so deep down our nature &apos;s actually nasty .
but why would you reconcile after a fight ?
and i thought , &quot; i should patent this . &quot;
and i can build muscles gradually , just like that .
at the time , there was a lot of opposition .
i had some very interesting conversations , as you can imagine .
or we &apos;ll be here all day with my childhood stories .
cassava &apos;s something that half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
we leap into the arms of big placebo .
we hate big government . we don &apos;t trust the man .
creates a bond , creates a bond of respect .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to swallow the sun .
we went back to the titanic wreck .

and i talked them into funding an expedition .
i grew up on a steady diet of science fiction .
it evolved to soak up impurities . &quot;
at least in the way that you and i understand it .
in terms of fuel , this really solves the problem .
now , i thought , how could i really capture this ?
i say we are ready for our own epic game .
we &apos;re using games to escape real-world suffering .
if you don &apos;t know it already , this is coming .
wouldn &apos;t we want to open doors for them instead ?
and this is a bit hard to justify i think .
they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
we think about a little boy trying to get to sleep .
we &apos;re trying to get to the point of automation .
this hit me when i went to replace my jeans .
so a sun , origin together , we build japan .
we know japan is the land of the rising sun .
the sun is coming up above the horizon . sunrise .
it also means tomorrow , after a day and a night .
if someone walks behind , that is &quot; to follow . &quot;
it pretty much flunks the bechdel test .
it &apos;s very good . don &apos;t let that stop you .
more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life .
but i don &apos;t think that explanation is good enough .
it &apos;s also like a form of respiration or circulation .
so i took the job as a sanitation worker .
fiction alone demystifies jealousy .
she is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of american letters .
even the cowboys are pit crews now .
it is not important if i like the job or not .
she &apos;s married to a man she mindfully chose .
they &apos;re high-speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
it just means that there &apos;s a different kind of right .
remi is 22 , tall and very handsome .
this was one of the lowest points in my life .
and i was like , &quot; cool . bring it . &quot;
but you have to fight for your self-determination today .
and on the c.d. , this was on .
and if you use your mobile phone , where you are .
it will be entrepreneurs , and they &apos;re doing it now .
freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable .
and you can see , the world is crazily green .
and a lot of us resonate with this phrase .

i had kidney cancer growing out of my tongue .
he lives in a small village in southern somalia .
walk past him . walk past him into your living room .
and they crash straight into the front door of your home .

they &apos;re on the streets every day , rhythmically .
so there &apos;s two types of vultures in this planet .
and , my favorite is , vultures are better looking .

and it seemed like time that we become that way ourselves .
once you &apos;ve made it , the installation &apos;s quite easy .
well this is a sagittal slice through me .
have a real happy birthday , and i love you .
hi , my name is frank , and i collect secrets .
and i would imagine that a lot of you have too .
and we got a lot of attention when we did it .
it &apos;s an infinite number -- literally goes on forever .
and i understood that this was the very essence of art .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality .
although we did make a little more money on that one .
so , you know , merging the two passions .
look to miguel -- farmers like miguel .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sponge .
i asked him how he became such an expert on fish .
also , the price of energy is very important to them .
we had 8,000 people play that game for eight weeks .
and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
we are effectively grading someone &apos;s worth to our community .
and &quot; ole ! &quot; to you , nonetheless .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
in a community of 10,000 people , we get 200 clients .
so for example , one guy from uganda says this .
after all , aging is not a piece of cake .
we created a 19-item two-minute checklist
and so we looked at what other high-risk industries do .
so the horizontal images were all an inversion .
using a rapid prototyping technique , another engineering technique .
and the first section ends at 20th st. right now .
that was enough . it really got the city behind it .
and it really was the topic that we now today sustainability .
she then , last year , painted this diagram .
some of you are in the field , i can see .
and this is called &quot; horse sense fence . &quot;
but it &apos;s not only numbers that i see in colors .
they don &apos;t spend time jockeying for power .
one of the young men in the room was aden .
so i can step back , and expand on that .
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals ?
the main problem we have here is kind of like aids .
now , the price of energy has come down over time .
they never give you a challenge that you can &apos;t achieve .
... these dosages have something to do with it .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
there are other pleasures , but this is dominant .
in 25 years it &apos;s gone from this , to this .
we &apos;re focusing on now fourth-generation fuels .
you may have read that we put watermarks in .
but it turns out synthesizing dna is very difficult .
you rented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
the next group of eight characters will build an extra 32 .
there &apos;s no public park in mogadishu .
repower america with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years .
and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings .
now , the experiencing self lives its life continuously .
it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
this is really what brought me to using satellite imagery .
we can do it two people together trying to improve trust .
if so , i haven &apos;t yet spotted it .
today i brought two recent projects as an example of this .
we pulled debris from canals and ditches .
and that &apos;s why the senate objected to it .
growing one plant will give you 1,000 , 10,000 seeds .
spend it on one of your teammates this week .
those are actually all real butterfly specimens .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . got off the phone .
they expect one billion more gamers in the next decade .
people in the satellite room are starting to move in now .
and this was debated in congress for ages and ages .
she &apos;s okay . the question is whether we will be .
it turned blue because of the genes we put in it .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
they &apos;re covered in sand . they &apos;re difficult to see .
70 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school .
when the work came back , i calculated grades .
the other end of the spectrum : i met this guy .
maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well .
i don &apos;t understand why i felt so great doing it .
and i discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
so he jumps in and kills the animals .
so great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
sometimes , i saw dead bodies floating down the river .
now , we were lucky with our hand-cleaning .
and i am on this stage because i am a model .
well the answer isn &apos;t going to be more of the same .
and the story of how all that happens is in this book .
and i &apos;m thinking , &quot; what the heck ? &quot;
but you can &apos;t count my fingers right now can you ?
you &apos;ve got to admit that &apos;s a lot of choice .
now we can do it in a more precise way .
thirty-five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information .
why do they market to us if we can &apos;t buy them ?
and do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
he started a landscaping and design floral company .
i told emma to explore work and make it count .

they need it , and we &apos;re not giving it to them .
i will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers .
i &apos;m going to keep writing anyway because that &apos;s my job .
and i started to think i should just dump this project .
like seaweed , and other things that are scary .
and we get to re-invent ourselves as often as we like .
so with this tool , this boundary has been broken .
so , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
what do you call the leader of a republican country ?
which presentation have you applauded the most this morning ?
so some people got this slip of paper and five dollars .
the good news is the benefits are stonkingly huge .
and there &apos;s a very simple task that they need to do .
you can just tell beforehand . and why is that ?
there &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s going on here .
i really want to see some twentysomethings here .
it &apos;s an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
and they &apos;re not just going to die of measles .
i &apos;m not part of that crowd , i have to say .
so , what can we synthesize out of all this ?
so , i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
and it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
i &apos;m sorry man . am i freaking you out ?
and it was much worse for a than for b in memory .
i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
it is also my great lifelong love and fascination .
i want to say just a word about salad dressing .
this is me at an early age with a baby chimpanzee .
and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have .
&quot; before i die , i want to be completely myself . &quot;
and i am going to suggest that this is a good thing .
the more money you earn the more satisfied you are .
what it had ruined were the memories of the experience .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
so stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
i couldn &apos;t have done better . i didn &apos;t settle .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
blaise , that is truly incredible . congratulations .
for us , the sun is the source of prosperity .
they are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters .
they came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems .
if you don &apos;t feel better about yourself , maybe you should .
i mean , it should have been so blatantly obvious .
we don &apos;t get that kind of constant feedback in real life .
first of all , why do they have such a bad press ?
so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
and then you need to focus on the killer items .
and we call them into a room and do experiments with them .
the apparatus is on the left with food on it .
otherwise nothing is going to happen and the rope disappears .
mayor giuliani wanted to tear it down .
for this family , he made this still-life painting .
and they were interested in developing a new , alternative art space .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t put limitations on yourself .
but for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too radical .
well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economically .
&quot; well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
that first one , it was more like a passionate affair .
and he &apos;s an economist . so , he &apos;s rational .
now you see this slight downturn at very advanced ages .
ever since then , i was fascinated by this incredible language .
you would probably begin by saying , &quot; to do what ? &quot;
the second is an aim : we should have more trust .
and that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me .
i also learned about the relentlessness of trash .
that &apos;s just not convenient for propaganda . got it .
but my dream was to become a chinese opera singer .
but this isn &apos;t what twentysomethings are hearing .
&quot; before i die , i want to plant a tree . &quot;
but i struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life .
as you can imagine , the town had been devastated .
but now , do you know how many nations have a president ?
this is a blueprint for countries like china and iran .
so it &apos;s a very small amount of money , in fact .
in fact , it doesn &apos;t matter how much money you spent .
we have to start making the real world more like a game .
we &apos;re getting used to a new way of being alone together .

well that &apos;s not what he was supposed to do with it .
so it wasn &apos;t all the good side of the illness .
i know i should mention , i &apos;m making all these things .
it can also mean the fibers that grow from a head .
put a plank underneath the tree , we have the foundation .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
this second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve grouped together .
can &apos;t we just cut it in half or a quarter ?
i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then .
i &apos;m thinking this must be an ancient print date , right .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
i mean , how much do we consume our memories ?
the biggest difference between them is in the handling of time .

we think it &apos;s clean -- smells good , too .
i would prefer to keep doing this work that i love .
and it &apos;s doing that based on the content inside the images .
it is that beautiful . it is yours to protect . &quot;
set the fire underneath the two trees , it &apos;s burning .
so what you have is an atmosphere of vulnerability and tension .
but then after a while i realized , this is my life .
it was a time when medicine was cheap and very ineffective .
find ways to demonstrate this as a value to your children .
but then these same children deny each other their full attention .
it must be rubbish . they binned it .
well the answer to that is a multidisciplinary team .
every patient we do has an absolutely bespoke implant .
it all started with a crazy idea in november of 2004 .
since it &apos;s digital , we can do reverse dissection .
but don &apos;t worry if you can &apos;t see it so well .
but the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless .
now shared car services are also springing up around the world .
we &apos;re pushing fuel efficiency to new heights .
and the radiologist report said , &quot; no cancer found . &quot;
one of them , i call my mimaw &apos;s test .
we &apos;ve heard it over the last two days here at ted .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-renewing .
and i can tell you that this is a transformative experience .
now , i also agree that that is rational , for now .
now , the two selves bring up two notions of happiness .
but one of them is distinctly worse than the other .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps .
we can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness .
well frankly , i think that &apos;s a stupid aim .
in fact , they &apos;re not even really shortcuts .
and i &apos;m a journalist , i need something to write about .
and i went to a few more of these memory contests .
but the common noun baker , we know bakers .
well the name baker doesn &apos;t actually mean anything to you .
i mean , you &apos;ve got to start somewhere , right ? &quot;
and arguably it wasn &apos;t even solving much of a problem .
the middle point is simply the way that the doctors protect themselves .
at least that &apos;s what it says on my pen . &quot;
it &apos;s that acrid , tar-like flavor .
for people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one ton .
so the alliance for climate protection has launched two campaigns .
and the predictions , as you &apos;ve read , are serious .
but &quot; the wizard of oz &quot; stood alone .
and the third is a task : we should rebuild trust .
at the most basic level , we remember when we pay attention .
&quot; the good earth &quot; is about chinese peasant life .

but there is no unemployment in world of warcraft .
right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
however , overtime , i got used to looking for them .
you have to give them the basis for giving you their trust .
how do i keep them motivated for the long run ? &quot;
it will prove to the world that anybody can do this . &quot;
and ed was like , &quot; i &apos;m not a s<unk> .
people died , including the crew of apollo 1 .
it &apos;s a hungry emotion . it must be fed .
i know i shall never feel lonely or powerless again .
i always wondered why they had lights but we didn &apos;t .
we need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy .
it &apos;s a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
liquor stores , fast food , vacant lots .
see , that is an empowered patient -- no medical training .
there &apos;s common . there &apos;s typical . there &apos;s no normal .
i realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
the funny thing about sustainability , you have to sustain it .
but as social scientists , we continue to ask about possible alternatives .
may none of your non-cancer cells become endangered species .
well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
i started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me to collect them .
what opinion polls record is , of course , opinions .
my research team and i went to west point military academy .
what i got here is an online augmented fitting room .
in fact , most of them were taken by random tourists .
i see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars .
i never did have someone . &quot; secrets can take many forms .
it &apos;s this amphitheater right over 10th ave .
and like any teacher , i made quizzes and tests .
i don &apos;t think anyone even noticed we weren &apos;t italian .
a very expensive pile of junk that does not go anywhere .
that was , the creativity had to find its outlet somehow .
a fish farm , but also a bird sanctuary .
and that &apos;s how they went about teaching them and treating them .
he said , &quot; well , you wouldn &apos;t remember meeting me .
so you can ask : how happy is the experiencing self ?
and his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world .
it was fun because this is actually not about training your memory .
and it &apos;s not science fiction . we have actually built it .
are they positively correlated ? giving money makes you happy .
and stress , worry , anger all decrease with age .
people experience pretend empathy as though it were the real thing .
&quot; and we &apos;d like to go ahead and close this out .
there is an economist named edward castronova .
this is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
frosty the coal man is a jolly , happy soul .
it &apos;s going to be a stretch to do it for nine .
all of this choice has two effects , two negative effects on people .
a mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit .
thank god almighty , i &apos;m free at last ! &quot;
i was like the pet lemur of the theater department .
she sleeps with her cellphone , so do i .
the only thing that matters is that you win or that you lose .
you can see it in the upper left-hand corner .
this is much sharper than an ultrasound would be .
i &apos;m going to define what the terms of my success are . &quot;
no fear , no agony , polio , puff , gone .
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . thank you very much .
turns out though , that that &apos;s not even where it stops .
now , the remembering self is a storyteller .
and everyone knew that this is how it functioned , right ?
he shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless .
we want to say , &quot; this is just the way it is .
let &apos;s say i &apos;m going to cut the liver right here .
i &apos;ll do it for you , and then i &apos;ll explain it .
and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape .
you increase paralysis , and you decrease satisfaction .
the light is shining down on cookie monster .
that &apos;s my flesh , and i can twist that around .
and she said it was like a thunderous train of air .
nowadays , everything is very much up for grabs .
and the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals .
the idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
so you can see the size of the issue that we &apos;re facing .
and i have to say , vera kind of scares me .
and in this one it &apos;s called &quot; drawing the short stick . &quot;
well , i think i understand , we hate big pharma .
tons of studies should have been done ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
it &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
so , you all know wikipedia , biggest wiki in the world .
and you are asked , &quot; who of them suffered more ? &quot;
i think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs .
it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you .
and the doc says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
and you say , &quot; doc , what should i do ? &quot;
it &apos;s very gratifying to have this kind of reception here .
that question stayed with me , and it simplified a little .
the poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause .
there &apos;s a lot of great books that have been written about this .
but then i said , i want to go out with this information .
we meet at the cafe . we meet at the pub .
but other teams we say , &quot; here &apos;s 15 euro .
i know you &apos;re all looking at that red country in the middle .
what will happen to societies that are top-heavy with older people ?
i &apos;m the one who doesn &apos;t want to be interrupted .
the thought of the warfarin was really quite frightening .
and i &apos;m going to show you the first experiment that we did .
do they understand that as well as the chimps , for example ?
so here &apos;s my question to you : what are you waiting for ?
like this is a painting of a snake in a box .
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why are we fighting it ?
of course , the curiosity , the science component of it .
because they &apos;re the ones that are experts in flavor too .
let &apos;s start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
superimposed on top of a nasa geospatial image .
it was about to change in ways that nobody could foresee .
so now let me introduce some of my fictional artists to you .
they produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time .
39 inches is the tallest structure i &apos;ve seen .
the system is so healthy , it purifies the water .
it &apos;s got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to one .
well , unfortunately , the skeptics come in different camps .
i &apos;ve got a picture here of a place in kentucky .
i take this hand away . you give the knife out .
take a good long look : this is today &apos;s clean coal technology .
and the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants .
we &apos;re limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination .
and if we do , can we boot up a chromosome ?
i &apos;m not telling you about it because i want to use it .
it &apos;s creating hyperlinks , if you will , between images .
let &apos;s remind ourselves that cells are not an abstract concept .
three women together , be careful , it &apos;s adultery .
three fires together , that &apos;s a lot of flames .
but you know , these shells , they &apos;re hard to find .
so you have to , i think , be trustworthy .
and my favorite , &quot; poor gumby-mouth terrorist .
their work , i think , is kind of liturgical .
who &apos;s going to take care of me if i have cancer ? &quot;
and that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
but , coca-cola did not sponsor this research .
within two weeks , i had 150 people wanting to join in .
so people thought that 20 dollars would be way better than five dollars .
we &apos;re lonely , but we &apos;re afraid of intimacy .
we now have a great clinical guidance out on the net .
and i tried to act calm , not to give anything away .
i read some to her , she reads some to me . &quot;
you know , nothing is possible in this fishbowl . &quot;
now what did i learn from this case ? well , three things .
you don &apos;t want to hear &quot; oops &quot; in real surgery .
it &apos;s about the size of a mini marshmallow .
let &apos;s see how powerful just one of these essentials can be .
i work with really amazing little itty bitty creatures called cells .
this was after 9 / 11 ; the city was in tough times .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
so the next day , just before the event , i called don .
&quot; 2.5 to one what ? what are you feeding ? &quot;
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
and so the question is , can you actually get that to zero ?
but it is not , by any means , an optimal situation .
if we overshoot , we can pour a little bit back .
one of the coal industry &apos;s ads around christmas was this one .
i &apos;m not good enough , and i can &apos;t do it . &quot;
and this is what we &apos;re doing when we make health care better .
we don &apos;t inherit an identity ; we get to invent it .
we &apos;re all born . we all bring our children into the world .
i don &apos;t know his name , but i do know his story .
but it is an irreproducible model for the future .
fiction alone domesticates it , invites it to the table .
that &apos;s what psychologists call an &quot; aha ! &quot; moment .
here &apos;s me on the soccer team and in v magazine .
i just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
these are the guys , they helped me unload the truck .
if you have access to this information , you can control your society .
they &apos;re more accepting of sadness than younger people are .
so we &apos;re getting very close to the human sense of fairness .
and we did that originally with capuchin monkeys .
so one of the two is not really interested in the task anymore .
i think it &apos;s a very unfair image for the wolf .
they were memorizing entire poems in just a few minutes .
that really is my skin . that is not a hollywood special effect .
and that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three month period .
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self .
well , their experiencing self is not going to get happier .
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
we don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
in fact , nasa has shown a lot of this is out there .
clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
now , what if that picture links to all of your pictures ?
but the waorani didn &apos;t just spear outsiders .
so after we know the characters , we start building phrases .
he forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
he went to university in mogadishu , graduated .
i don &apos;t think kids &apos; movies have anything to do with that .
these two examples , they have a common approach in the design process .
now we also study more complex expressions . this is consolation .
since 1970 , no human beings have been back to the moon .
the people that i grew up with had no problem with my faith .
cliffside park , new jersey is my hometown .
so in these examples , we are reaching into the digital world .
vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds .
reality and history have endowed that title with grandeur .
so at the end , i had a settlement with them .
and some even said , this would be stasi 2.0 .
this directive &#91; is &#93; called data retention directive .
and then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship .
it &apos;s good to get gifts for people that you know .
i &apos;m at a business school , so that &apos;s what we do .
the best way to describe it is , i share therefore i am .
but here , connection is more like a symptom than a cure .
have we so lost confidence that we will be there for each other ?
there is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude .
and if the tv was on , we were watching a documentary .
we barely break even . there is no fame in it .
i said , &quot; what percentage of your feed is chicken ? &quot;
this supercomputer was called the global extinction awareness system , of course .
easy to remember , since a talking tree is pretty idiotic .
now , almost none of these movies pass the bechdel test .
and i think that judgment requires us to look at three things .
i thought this was just fascinating , and i got really into it .
most of all , going to the moon turned out to be easy .
suddenly , my disability on the world wide web is fair game .
it &apos;s as simple as what i learned to say to alex .
and a second idea i got was to use a scarecrow .
he &apos;s not greedy . he doesn &apos;t see skin color .
i see dialysis centers popping up like starbucks .
local , passionate people . that &apos;s who you have applauded .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i &apos;m a game designer .
so — — so the government says , &quot; do it again . &quot;
institutional barriers were another serious headache in the project .
so one needs to be careful with disciplinary conventions .
so this is the 50 percent line that &apos;s the random expectation .
not only that , but they can also be used for disease models .
this one &apos;s called &quot; mixtape love song &apos;s nest . &quot;
let &apos;s go back to the questions i posed you a moment ago .
please , don &apos;t tell me there are no consequences to these things .
i don &apos;t need to say this , but vaccines are essential .
and we became a family , over a four and half year period .
it &apos;s going to be this epic romance , passionate film .
so the pinker the belly , the better the system . &quot;
he said , &quot; fish ? i didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
until finally , i got on the phone with the head biologist .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing .
something fake becomes something real because of someone &apos;s perception of it .
i won the contest , which really wasn &apos;t supposed to happen .
you can practically feel his blue fur tickling your nose .
sometimes , we can &apos;t solve big problems because our political systems fail .
and does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way ?
read it from an african woman , the damage that we have done .
and we also found bacteria that normally inhabit the gut .
we got the lead safety engineer for boeing to help us .
the health care industry would like stronger protections for inventors .
i fainted and landed on it , and it broke .
what we saw in that kidney was that big blob there .
and he makes a work that answers what they think great art is .
words too , for me , have colors and emotions and textures .
i &apos;m only showing the top 500 most popular wikipedia pages right here .
i mentioned that to miguel , and he nodded .
then where do you go ? you may need heart surgery or something .
and this is from a large traveling sculpture project that he &apos;s doing .
so if i put them next to each other , they get interested .
he &apos;s affordable and adorable , and workers keep their pay .
what do i do to teach kids a solid work ethic ?
this is something from a patricia highsmith novel .
and that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flashlight .
it &apos;s like throwing a stone in a pond of water .
a large majority of which did actually find their home again , importantly .
i know we &apos;re getting personal , but i was a young girl .
so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
that &apos;s enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants .
a mobile phone can change your life , and gives you individual freedom .
but in the process , we set ourselves up to be isolated .
so this is basically the wall street protest that you see here .
six months into the lawsuit , we finally reached the discovery phase .
you &apos;re driven to do something that everyone has told you is impossible .
i would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals .
now with elephants , it &apos;s very dangerous to work with elephants .
and this one &apos;s called &quot; lovemaking nest . &quot;
so , just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective .
we are evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species .
but when they go away , so does much of the drinking water .
and i &apos;m going to just sterilize it a tiny bit .
ninety-nine . well , that &apos;s an improvement .
it &apos;s not true that we can &apos;t solve big problems through technology .
what defines a story are changes , significant moments and endings .
that was the moment i realized , 30 is not the new 20 .
and what i read was that my median survival was 24 weeks .
they raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands .
now i have no idea what &quot; talknophical &quot; is .
his mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy .
it &apos;s not a birth defect . you can &apos;t catch it .
first the claim : why do people think trust has declined ?
they don &apos;t survive on sunlight based system the way we do .
hopefully , we will have cleaned up forestry , cement .
so , with energy , all i could come up with is this .
so growth mindset is a great idea for building grit .
it &apos;s realizing you can &apos;t have that career you now want .
also , i realized there was a wide gap between north and south .
it &apos;s very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos .
because , you see , at least we fed the hippos .
older people can view injustice with compassion , but not despair .
because he believed that , with mobility , comes freedom and progress .
this amazing substance -- again i mentioned , where does my body end ?
things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can &apos;t support .
&quot; do i look like i can write down a song right now ?
but the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful .
it certainly puts finding seashells by the seashore in perspective .
and that makes it just really hard to tell how the disease is going .
has one person in this audience ever see someone die of measles ?
so i can step back , pop right back in to a specific section .
and that &apos;s the truth . now , the studio didn &apos;t know that .
this is a portrait by a photographer named phil toledano .
most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
so , how do you find a buried city in a vast landscape ?
same word , different amount of remembering ; that &apos;s weird .
and after a few months went by , i realized that he was different .
so green grounds has gone on to plant maybe 20 gardens .
but our fantasies of substitution have cost us .
it was the very bottom , the last secret in the long column .
there &apos;s a few things i learned while doing these 30-day challenges .
and our quality of life is going to be severely compromised .
and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam .
gorgeous beach . beautiful day . they have it all to themselves .
so i decided , i &apos;m going to start my own biennial .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think we can .
well , i got on the phone with a few people in the company .
you know jerry bruckheimer movies , you form a dream team .
an extraordinary statement to make about your life &apos;s work , you know .
so , this is the publication we had just a short while ago .
there &apos;s some magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
in the trenches . richard turere , you are something else .
it &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in nairobi .
&quot; before i die , i want to live off the grid . &quot;
buy them something as a gift or a present and give it to them .
he says , &quot; it &apos;s really brought us closer together through the years .
and , in fact , can sometimes feel downright paranormal .
last year at ted i gave an introduction to the lhc .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
it &apos;s so mysterious , and it &apos;s so pervasive .
they darken your urine . they almost never do more than that .
they were thoughtful people , educated people , decent people .
we &apos;re on the verge of amazing , amazing events in many fields .
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators .
and so there is a thread of something that i think is appropriate .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the personal computer is a miracle .
okay , so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing .
we know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self .
this is the source of much of the coal in west virginia .
i think it &apos;s better if we encourage our great creative minds to live .
it &apos;s such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope .
maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e-book .
he &apos;s a prisoner , just like jonah inside the whale .
who cleans up after us in rio or in paris or in london ?
that &apos;s a lot of death of measles , 20 an hour .
so what i want to do here , we gotta make this sexy .
to change the community , you have to change the composition of the soil .
i &apos;ve coined a phrase &quot; obstructive conservatism . &quot;
and even worse , it inevitably foreshortens your life .
so he will get a return favor at some point in the future .
you can see that they work together , they pull at the same moment .
the wolf is , after all , a very cooperative animal .
however , i did have this idea , and it was kind of good .
i can cut any way i want to , so i cut right here .
and we must have an infrastructure that &apos;s designed to support this flexible future .
the problem , put in its simplest terms , is one of mathematics .
now i was an engaged patient long before i ever heard of the term .
this is a typical angora embroidery for them .
and this one &apos;s called &quot; lovelock &apos;s nest . &quot;
they yield to the slightest movement or motion or emotion .
and the great indicator of that , of course , is language loss .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world unto ourselves .
these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources .
they are building an epic knowledge resource about the world of warcraft .
now , what does that have to do with the placebo effect ?
there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . thanks .
i learned it myself from cub scout magic in the 1970s .
and the poem is called &quot; the god who only knows four words . &quot;
it means , to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
continue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
it didn &apos;t -- that chemical engineering block john , how &apos;s it going ?
to put it in context for myself : i was born in 1946 .
should i respond to this email ? should i draft this letter ? &quot;
the modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
this isn &apos;t going to be solved by any one person or one group .
and of course , we all share the same adaptive imperatives .
this area is huge -- it &apos;s four miles by three miles in size .
the monkeys are rather aggressive , as are the apple trees .
are they competent ? are they honest ? are they reliable ?
it &apos;s about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways .
so here are some amazing goals that i think we can deal with now .
they &apos;re ultra-low cost , and we all know what happens .
so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
kenya , this world , will be much poorer without these wonderful species .
in china , it was hard living as a young girl without my family .
so together with zeit online and open data city , i did this .
because i want to show the people what does data retention mean .
okay , can you sell it ? can you look after the money ? &quot;
&quot; yeah , well of course , i &apos;m looking after my patient . &quot;
but that brings me to lesson number two : cells do all the work .
in this case , we put two chimpanzees side-by-side .
if your work bombed , not entirely your fault , you know ?
so many of them are occluded by faces , and so on .
i &apos;m not sure if i have time to show you any other environments .
we started to be able to see where the nile used to flow .
what if i had been forced into that same state of waithood ?
i might , after all , know that she wasn &apos;t a good driver .
newspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood .
i got a chance to come by plane for my first time for ted .
we can do high-frequency monitoring to get objective data .
i &apos;m not going to tell you the damage that that money has done .
we &apos;re all specialists now , even the primary care physicians .
in the u.k. we have the national institute for clinical excellence , nice .
so the surgical implantation actually was the easiest part .
the one on the left is the monkey who gets cucumber .
it has now been done with dogs and with birds and with chimpanzees .
and all i can say about this is : why are we fighting it ?
a maybe that could take the form of a gas or a liquid .
i explored the human skin , and how technology can transform the body .
this is the last postcard i have to share with you today .
and this next postcard was made out of one of those photos .
but we need to get going , and we need to get going today .
so , if we make no changes today , what does tomorrow look like ?
and i really began to develop a deeper appreciation of the natural world .
so it kind of cooled my test driving for a little while .
they &apos;d sit down , i &apos;d sneak out of the house .
this is a live story unfolding just in the last few weeks .
that fall of 1969 , the whole earth catalog came out .
the next is a collective of artists called the silver dobermans .
what he did was to get wild birds to make his art for him .
and then i realized one day , there &apos;s an easier solution to this .
i &apos;m a contemporary artist with a bit of an unexpected background .
and my first car was a 1975 electric-green mustang .
he had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded .
and then there are some friends calling me , and they call each other .
this is a real medical need , literally a life-saving donation .
and we thought , let &apos;s make people do it and see what happens .
and i want to suggest today that , in fact , that &apos;s wrong .
the cause of our troubles is actually the complexity that science has given us .
and we have the greatest chance of success if we recognize our vulnerability .
human relationships are rich and they &apos;re messy and they &apos;re demanding .
it really is that simple in concept , though not in execution .
so the possibility exists to simply externally wrap the pipe .
and especially if the partner draws attention to itself , they choose more .
one young girl posted the last message she ever heard from her grandmother .
&quot; i found your camera at lollapalooza this summer .
and i remember exactly where i was and what i was doing that day .
today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world .
it &apos;s what we believe about people when we name them with these words .
and look at how the tumor sizes plummeted in between .
there &apos;s so much about trust -- what sources of information can we trust ?
and that &apos;s my cousin and my sister &apos;s dog , gabby .
this is one of their founders , gert schaeffer .
and my dad is the most voracious reader i know .
it &apos;s law , it &apos;s morality , it &apos;s patent stuff .
and no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk .
you know , where it was highly technical , and it required enormous planning .
because when that water leaves , it dumps out into the atlantic .
it &apos;s a fish farm in the southwestern corner of spain .
so , i take my inspiration from something that happened 2,500 years ago .
what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can &apos;t achieve everything ?
this is a gamer on the verge of an epic win .
that &apos;s my skin right there . this is not a hollywood special effect .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
when this happens , we &apos;re not able to appreciate who they are .
you know , i never thought that i &apos;d end up working at microsoft .
it &apos;s an independent territory . they control all mineral resources .
for me , entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business .
what i do know is that talent doesn &apos;t make you gritty .
now visualize a pack of overweight nudists on bicycles .
what &apos;s it like to wear the uniform and bear that burden ?
no jealous king , no &quot; arabian nights . &quot;
and i got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys .
so predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
i was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
this is a satellite picture showing north korea at night compared to neighbors .
a huge famine hit north korea in the mid-1990s .
this was the first time i heard that people in my country were suffering .
gardening is my graffiti . i grow my art .
we &apos;re more appreciative , more open to reconciliation .
&quot; before i die , i want to hold her one more time . &quot;
now this elephant does something illegal that we did not teach it .
and for this purpose , traditional cell culture techniques just really aren &apos;t enough .
can you feel where on the number line the solution is likely to fall ?
so , isn &apos;t it interesting that high stakes have a strong impact .
why am i doing this ? what do i get out of it ? &quot;
it &apos;s a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution .
we did a game called superstruct at the institute for the future .
this is going to influence policy , i think , in years to come .
future &apos;s over here . wind , sun , a new energy grid .
somewhere in here there are actually a series of photographs -- here we go .
i believe it is his ability to identify and seize a new opportunity .
and do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie ?
why ? and is there something the rest of us can learn from this ?
my crooked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places .
do something that &apos;s an investment in who you might want to be next .
emma needed a better life , and i knew this was her chance .
sometimes , big problems that had seemed technological turn out not to be so .
we want alternative energy sources that can compete on price . none exist .
so at age 15 , i knew i was too old to be trained .
this is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture .
and we studied whether and how their emotional experiences changed as they grew older .
we are , you are , the most underused resource in health care .
well you can &apos;t get much bigger than pi , the mathematical constant .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds .
as the old saying goes , two is company , three is a crowd .
i learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years .

and the other thing we saw is the amount of money doesn &apos;t matter that much .
it didn &apos;t make them less happy , it just didn &apos;t do much for them .
skill number one is the ability to recognize success and the ability to recognize failure .
then she sees the other one getting grape , and you will see what happens .
i love to speak on college campuses and share secrets and the stories with students .
this was part of a challenge i did to take a picture everyday for a month .
today the average american spends about a week a year stuck in traffic jams .
most hospitals don &apos;t offer it , so they won &apos;t even tell you it exists .
it &apos;s in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
made all these films , made all these documentary films for a very limited audience .
two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people .
and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while .
but , when i chose a career , as an adult , it was film making .
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no impurities . &quot;
before we had awesome game controlers we had sheep &apos;s knuckles .
and that really starts with a basic response of our memories -- it starts immediately .
you attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it .
we take the pictures of those mini-big bangs inside detectors .
there are enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually digest dna .
i started thinking about how a new , fast method of learning chinese might be useful .
now if somebody said to you , &quot; do you trust greengrocers ?
and third is that their image has nothing to do with africa and with ethiopia .
but before the apollo program ended , 24 men flew to the moon .
does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity ?
it &apos;s not cheating . it &apos;s the science of how information spreads .
but i know electric fences are already invented , but i want to make mine .
there are effects that you can control live , like reverb and filter .
and also , they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing .
my parents couldn &apos;t afford physical therapy , so they sent me to dancing school .
but what do we do ? we can &apos;t go the tom ripley route .
the post-millennial midlife crisis isn &apos;t buying a red sports car .
i want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes .
&quot; i was walking and met a long-time friend whose son was sick with malaria .
we might spend time with people we don &apos;t even like because it &apos;s somehow interesting .
maybe i can cut there , see the brain , and i can change my cut .
but with the rise of interstate trucking , it was used less and less .
so designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process .
so , i was completely smitten by this , and had to do more .
so , that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it .
no , not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ? &quot;
and the main lesson i think that we have learned , is they are really different .
the memory palace , these memory techniques , they &apos;re just shortcuts .
it &apos;s a photograph i took in the northwest amazon just last april .
this was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call waithood .
so we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project .
it doesn &apos;t just kill everybody , it mangles the bodies beyond all recognition .
having little need to remember anymore , it sometimes seems like we &apos;ve forgotten how .
no , the reasons we can &apos;t solve big problems are more complicated and more profound .
but how about reversing its role and having the digital information reach us instead ?
and i got a switch where i can switch on the lights , on and off .
we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
the neurologist &apos;s test is non-invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
and yet , what we found were that these were tools to help make experts better .
this is from a short film , &quot; adventures of skinny . &quot;
at that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
i believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive .
or &quot; how was your trip to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
but on the other side of that though , we were big readers in our house .
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what those reasons are .
and the reason is , it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
here are the four things i came up with . the first is urgent optimism .
when you do break it , i &apos;m going to give you a hundred bucks . &quot;
i &apos;m going to organize it and direct it and get it going in the world .
i really do believe that , and , no , it ain &apos;t wishful thinking .
but now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess .
and i &apos;m insecure because i have to think about what i look like every day .
and it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
but the question that i kind of want to pose is -- you know , why not ?
with so many options to choose from , people find it very difficult to choose at all .
and , you know , if we think about it this way it starts to change everything .
matty shared with me an emotional email he received from the mother in that picture .
this drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires .
finally , the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .
i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model .
and sometimes afterwards i &apos;ll stick around and sign books and take photos with students .
so , if my three older sisters were mopping , i was mopping .
the sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp .
but what emma needed wasn &apos;t some therapist who really , really cared .
work happened later , marriage happened later , kids happened later , even death happened later .
we hide in dark , windowless rooms , and generally avoid sunlight .
government approved , american cancer society , but patients know what patients want to know .
but what i wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep .
i &apos;ve left out tide , geothermal , fusion , biofuels .
grit is living life like it &apos;s a marathon , not a sprint .
so here &apos;s an idea worth spreading to every twentysomething you know .
now there are problems associated with aging -- diseases , poverty , loss of social status .
but it &apos;s also worth noting that cells also mediate our experience of life .
in the case of hare , it &apos;s an ambiguous sound in english .
you &apos;ve seen recently , corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment .
and there were all sorts of suggestions on the table , which might have made it .
they &apos;re also fairly wealthy and affluent and all these other sorts of things .
you have to identify that this is a before-takeoff checklist .
that feeling that no one is listening to me is very important in our relationships with technology .
you could see in the middle that device , that little structure , squeezing out .
but with sarah brosnan we started out with capuchin monkeys .
and at that population level , our planet will be dealing with the limits of growth .
because if you wonder why patients are motivated and want to help , think about this .
and what he does is -- he spends a week at a time with a family .
and so this is five foot , five inches of frost that she left behind .
my great-grandparents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
so what we &apos;re looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age .
and i don &apos;t mean just good as in successful , although that &apos;s part of it .
i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick .
and would you want to meet that poor , beige person if they existed ?
this person is sneaking out of a door , escaping , evading .
i could either deny my mental illness or embrace my mental skillness .
let &apos;s take the example of the heart , the topic of a lot of my research .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the limits of possibility .
now , how we &apos;re going to go forward on this : what &apos;s the right approach ?
and if you want the ultimate in placebo you &apos;ve go to the needle .
but then i remembered tom talking to the open air and i tried it .
and we think we &apos;ll have the first fourth-generation fuels in about 18 months .
you can see in the top panel , its chromosome just gets blown apart .
this one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us .
it makes points about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things slowly .
i mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
i haven &apos;t read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe .
but i only thought that i would be separated from my family for a short time .
so i was a little bit skeptical , what should i do with it ?
you might be sleep-deprived , but you &apos;ll finish your novel .
and up above , you &apos;ve got a series of pedestrian walkways .
if we &apos;re not able to be alone , we &apos;re going to be more lonely .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us because this is a bigger deal than that .
usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don &apos;t .
i &apos;ve calculated the total we need at 21 billion hours of game play every week .
and we know from that study that when you want reality you go to the needle .
so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability .
and then he added , really quite emotionally , it ruined the whole experience .
i think that can be changed by building combinatorial vaccines in advance .
a chromosome , by the way , is just a piece of inert chemical material .
you know , my favorite part of being a dad is the movies i get to watch .
and we think about proust , we think about the sentimental bits , right ?
the house of representatives didn &apos;t want washington to get drunk on power .
with a mobile phone , you can shoot a crime against humanity in syria .
and we said to the zambians , &quot; my god , the hippos ! &quot;
you know , after all , if it doesn &apos;t work out , there &apos;s always tomorrow .
now we in medicine , i think , are baffled by this question of cost .
it &apos;s my gospel , when i &apos;m telling people , grow your own food .
and we study that in our chimpanzees by presenting them with an animated head .
so this brings me to lesson number one : life can do a lot with very little .
we call this the biomimetic paradigm -- copying nature in the lab .
my life is guided by two great passions , and the first is automobiles .
but as far as being a performer , i &apos;m also diagnosed bipolar .
and you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , i learned a lot .
sounds crazy . but this goes back to that theme about about your imagination creating a reality .
now , when i use the term miracle , i don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .
this is really my flesh . this is not damian &apos;s special grown flesh .
in the united states , efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population .
it &apos;s an open-ended story , and he gets to decide how it unfolds .
and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question .
if i asked you to name the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
a door . put a plank inside the door , it &apos;s a door bolt .
i didn &apos;t just ride in the trucks now . i drove the trucks .
turns out , all he wanted to do was to stack the siftables up .
the volume of surgery had spread around the world , but the safety of surgery had not .
now it &apos;s : i want to have a feeling , i need to send a text .
this is a recent shot of my daughter and her friends being together while not being together .
he said , &quot; if you don &apos;t want to follow my instructions , go away . &quot;
here , just for historical authenticity , is a picture of me in that year .
you can &apos;t look her directly in the eyes , because she &apos;s kind of scary .
this is by z. zhou , and he &apos;s interested in stasis .
this is by a duo , michael abernathy and bud holland .
and with each version , kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
it &apos;s true , we &apos;ve got a huge food problem , but this isn &apos;t science .
so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this curse .
here , in fact , is the state of all the demo that i just gave .
it tasted sweet and clean like you were taking a bite of the ocean .
the r &amp; amp ; d piece , it &apos;s crazy how little it &apos;s funded .
those who were still around in school , besides the people who had dropped out .
and he digs through everything they have , and he finds materials to make work .
this is the kangerlussuaq river in southwest greenland .
should i get married later ? should i have kids first , or a career first ? &quot;
of course , mapping is one of those really obvious applications for a technology like this .
whether it &apos;s the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant .
it &apos;s a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world .
we sat down and brainstormed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city .
let &apos;s go to 221b baker street and ask for sherlock holmes .
so your 20s are the time to educate yourself about your body and your options .
i &apos;m a child of 1984 , and i live in the city of berlin .
so we &apos;ve asked all sorts of questions to see if we could undo this finding .
tom treasure , professor of cardiothoracic surgery : incredible guy .
so in the end i went to private investors and i just gave up on it .
so this is already about a hundred years ago that we were doing experiments on cooperation .
it redefines the role of skin , and our bodies become an atomizer .
i printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards , just like this .
if you have capsules , they are more effective than tablets in any form .
patronizing , i treat everybody from another culture as if they were my servants .
we slip into thinking that always being connected is going to make us fell less alone .
i suppose ultimately the funding bureaucrats have really got to get their act together .
and then we realized that it was actually a mirror image of the real aorta .
but there will be nobody else in this room that understands all of those four words .
and that &apos;s sort of the body channel of emotional empathy , which many animals have .
and the main case was , this is going to make good economic sense for the city .
and every night i go home , my commute is a total crap shoot .
when we look at the population growth in terms of cars , it becomes even clearer .
but cars are really more than a passion of mine ; they quite literally in my blood .
i talked my family into doing this , and they didn &apos;t know what i was doing .
because we would do these things with 10-12 people working for years at a time .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
if you &apos;re counting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible miracle battery .
and that &apos;s my hope that you will join me in making and playing games like this .
but at no point does it return to the levels we see in early adulthood .
and so we started down the road of : can we synthesize a chromosome ?
all cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
this is a site located in the eastern egyptian delta called bendix .
i ended up coming back to that same contest that i had covered a year earlier .
in your living room , in full imaginative broadband , picture britney spears .
the doctors said that i wouldn &apos;t walk , but i am here in front of you .
we think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea .
now , five years later , she &apos;s a special events planner for museums .
my next invention is , i want to make an electric fence . electric fence ?
&quot; before i die , i want to straddle the international date line . &quot;
we need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage .
for weeks , all the volunteers and locals alike had been finding similar things .
and after three weeks of debate , in the end the senate did not cave in .
but if we don &apos;t change the composition of the soil , we will never do this .
you can zoom in and zoom out , you can wind back and fast forward .
to study a very poorly studied , little known material that &apos;s found on people everywhere .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef .
so , backing up from there , what should the 2020 report card look like ?
endings are very , very important and , in this case , the ending dominated .
&quot; aw , i can &apos;t believe pixar made a princess movie . &quot;
i think these are so commonplace , they &apos;ve become clichés of our society .
so i left the classroom , and i went to graduate school to become a psychologist .
i went to teach seventh graders math in the new york city public schools .
maybe it was names from an old yearbook that i bought at a flea market .
finally , big problems sometimes elude solution because we don &apos;t really understand the problem .
we know that 80 percent of life &apos;s most defining moments take place by age 35 .
and it hit me : one of the most important things we all make are memories .
many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions .
they had to get out quickly , so i started planning how to help them escape .
it &apos;s not . it &apos;s down to a campaigner for the freedom of the press .
and what snollygoster means is &quot; a dishonest politician . &quot;
and in this picture , i had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
but more than a symptom , constant connection is changing the way people think of themselves .
two hours to install one of our devices compared to six hours for the existing treatment .
and as a result , the patent troll can claim that they won the case .
they can connect us to our deepest humanity or with people we &apos;ll never meet .
nature feeds the heart cells in your body with a very , very dense blood supply .
and i thought , &quot; you know , i wonder what my soleus muscle is ? &quot;
i had to sit down with my daughter and say , &quot; here &apos;s the situation . &quot;
it was everything . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
and he doesn &apos;t grow roses because they use too much water , by the way .
one is there &apos;s very little violence in &quot; the wizard of oz . &quot;
but if , on the other hand , they &apos;re unreliable , we might not .
however , if i grew up with social media , i don &apos;t think i would be .
&quot; bride &quot; in chinese literally means &quot; new mother . &quot; uh-oh .
and as he grew older , he grew more different , and the differences became more obvious .
but half aren &apos;t , and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group .
by get identity capital , i mean do something that adds value to who you are .
this is south central : liquor stores , fast food , vacant lots .
i asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they &apos;d never told anyone before .
at coalergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business .
i learned how to dance in heels , which means i can walk in heels .
and then , overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence .
but you watch that movie enough times , and you start to realize how unusual it is .
human universal -- so you spend money on other people , you &apos;re being nice to them .
well we &apos;re no genetically hardier than our ancestors were 10,000 years ago .
but it &apos;s pit crews that we need , pit crews for patients .
that we listen when technology says it will take something complicated and promises something simpler .
these are q-tips stuck to my roommate with wig glue .
and i thought like , &quot; wow . i am like living in a science fiction movie .
drought drives the small village into poverty and to the brink of starvation .
perhaps if there were more positive images , it would foster less hate on the internet .
and i was , as a kid , constantly drawing comic books , and so on .
you &apos;d be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas .
l.a. leads the united states in vacant lots that the city actually owns .
you never arrive in a community with any ideas , and you sit with the local people .
in those heady days , we were experimenting with chat rooms and online virtual communities .
just a moment ago , my daughter rebecca texted me for good luck .
today we need that same leap in thinking for us to create a viable future .
that &apos;s a lot easier than the school taught you to do math , i &apos;m sure .
and now i &apos;ll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression .
spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
christianity , islam , buddhism , judaism , whatever .
so we see it in religions and self-help books , that money can &apos;t buy happiness .
so in my work , i hear that life is hard , relationships are filled with risk .
and over time , we seem to forget this , or we seem to stop caring .
and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right .
and i &apos;m flying a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship .
now , essentially we &apos;re in the same position we were in with the knife trick .
so if i want to see the back side , i can flip and see from behind .
here &apos;s a website , visiblebody.com , that i stumbled across .
he &apos;s an australian aboriginal elder , and he &apos;s also an artist .
each of these has four different variations , you get to choose which one you want to use .
that &apos;s not at all what my creative process is -- i &apos;m not the pipeline !
on the 10th of september last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
you really want to get the decision right if it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
it &apos;d make , i thought , maybe a nice epilogue to all my research .
i &apos;m not advocating capitalism , i &apos;m just pointing out their relationship .
so i put the lights . you can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
when one dollar &apos;s worth of green beans will give you 75 dollars &apos; worth of produce .
&quot; just in the nick of time to save the zambian people from starvation . &quot;
but very soon we &apos;re going to see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other .
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be chez panisse , but it would be nice .
and one reason is , this enormous heat sink heats up greenland from the north .
and i think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years .
these organisms can be totally desiccated ; they can live in a vacuum .
this is a more realistic case . this is an issue of the guardian .
and in order to understand this , i &apos;m going to take you back a couple of generations .
can you get a sense of the range of meanings that it &apos;s pointing you towards ?
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of the argentinians .
so , that &apos;s where i get my 21 billion hours a week of game-play from .
and people would say , &quot; aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to have any success ?
well , how do we boot up a chromosome ? how do we activate this ?
that is to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
and then people would be able to eat it and they &apos;d be able to not go blind .
because i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the secretary of h.h.s .
and you say , &quot; if you were me , doc , what would you do ? &quot;
so let &apos;s take a tour of this state-of-the-art clean coal facility .
having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered .
so , you would have heard of his theory of success , the 10,000 hour theory of success .
i &apos;m going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side .
you know i think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy .
but now there is another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suffered ? &quot;
but you ask the indians , and they say , &quot; the plants talk to us . &quot;
and she looked at me and she went , &quot; five , four , three , two ... &quot;
settling down in south korea was a lot more challenging than i had expected .
before march , 2011 , i was a photographic re<unk> based in new york city .
we found out that they did in fact spend it in the way that we asked them to .
i would think no one in this room understands those four first jargon points there .
my solution : award me this patent and i will troll them out of existence .
i would never have been that adventurous before i started my 30-day challenges .
i felt , oh this is the kind of project that i could spend my whole life doing .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same .
and so , playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation .
so , the big question is , &quot; what exactly are gamers getting so good at ? &quot;
and matty takes the pictures off these cameras and posts them on his website every week .
we never have those feelings when we &apos;re playing games , they just don &apos;t exist in games .
and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the experiencing self &apos;s life ?
and i promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked .
twelve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
so i want to show you an example of how we see differently using the infrared .
but he was the second child , and the level of supervision had plummeted .
and that would remind you that you would want to then introduce your friend ed cook .
and i was astonished , i was very angry , and i was deeply confused .
since now , i &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
thus we are told that &quot; my mercy takes precedence over my anger . &quot;
on may the 13th , i made my way to the town of <unk> funato .
and here &apos;s just two of the ones we saw that are just really interesting to think about .
beyond these sorts of things , a medical doctor didn &apos;t have a lot that they could do .
so i decided to start a lawsuit against them , because i wanted to have this information .
it &apos;s only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them .
instead of pushing water out , they used the channels to pull water back in .
so in recent years , we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
which means that , you know , in a life there , are about 600 million of them .
now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self .
and you cannot understand the pain of tibet until you move through it at the ground level .
but there is a number that is greater than this that &apos;s going to bring this room down .
it has not yet caught on and caught fire , but maybe today we will start a movement .
and then the inspiration came from these beautiful buttons of the ethiopian women &apos;s dresses .
proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy .
so yes , half of twentysomethings are un- or under-employed .
it &apos;ll be a very boring movie — — of a slow , ordinary bullet in motion .
and we need to establish that existentially before we do so sociopolitically .
and this information is stored for at least six months in europe , up to two years .
because you can see where i am , where i sleep at night , what i am doing .
and the people in the back go , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t really see that . &quot;
the medics amongst you , if there are any , will recognize the first two .
so she gives us now a pro-social token and both chimps get fed .
but when i look towards the future , the next project is completely unknown and wide open .
just like this , students can isolate anybody and dissect any way you want to .
we worked with them to really create a design that was inspired by that wildscape .
they built it 30 ft. in the air , right through the middle of the city .
but even with a cowboy , about one person a month was killed and run over .
who knows what we &apos;ll be able to do when we learn to make more use of it .
she &apos;s a veterinarian , so she &apos;s seen lots of ultrasounds .
and so they &apos;re valuable . this is precious metals and gemstones .
i hope that i &apos;ve given you the desire to learn to see the world with new eyes .
we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it : &quot; progress . &quot;
and the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world .
now , he &apos;s mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
they played dice games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
this is a sun placed with the origin , because japan lies to the east of china .
and from these , i can drill into the web page and just launch them again .
so we can go , jump , and take a look at all the ted prize winners .
and , although it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of concerns about that .
now that &apos;s back from high school algebra , but let &apos;s take a look .
these are ancient dice , made out of sheep &apos;s knuckles . right ?
and some of you have probably read malcom gladwell &apos;s new book outliers .
it &apos;s only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect .
even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical -- they &apos;re sugar pills .
i read a study , a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open .
and he called this part of the course the x factor , the potential of the human will .
just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about .5 .
and siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information .
with a hundred different kinds of jeans on display , there is no excuse for failure .
we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones .
it doesn &apos;t create the distortion of reality ; it creates the dissolution of reality .
i want to play something that i shamelessly stole from cellists .
he empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs , that they could be change makers .
but the question was how we could do a multistory , contemporary building with these principles .
my name is maysoon zayid , and if i can can , you can can .
his name is paulie , and we worked together many times , and we became good friends .

i think that the claim , the aim and the task are all misconceived .
my father &apos;s mantra was , &quot; you can do it , yes you can can . &quot;
so my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when i grow up .
it &apos;s save the lives of 400 , 500,000 kids in the developing world every year .
the next question people always ask me is , &quot; do they retouch all the photos ? &quot;
that &apos;s why the white people in africa are called &quot; bwana , &quot; boss .
but i think we &apos;re ignoring certain facts that tell us something about what we can do .
so , anatomage table shows exactly how the anatomy will appear in x-ray .
so we commissioned an economic feasibility study to try to make the case .
so parking garages , buses , trains , they all operate within the same system .
in the left femur , the left thigh bone , there &apos;s another one .
this morning , some of the speakers named the date when they found out about their condition .
but i &apos;m here to tell you , &quot; patient &quot; is not a third-person word .

so some teams , we give people on the team money , they spend it on themselves .
it also , money often makes us feel very selfish and we do things only for ourselves .
most important , we all really need to listen to each other , including to the boring bits .
the result of all this is that you can get incredibly quick progress on incredibly small budgets .
and in humans , of course , we can study that with yawn contagion .
that is your best case outcome when you get sued by a patent troll .
so to address this , we developed with a dr. brown in stanford : virtual dissection table .
you know , cadaver dissection is the traditional way of learning human anatomy .
and this is the diagram of stage four kidney cancer from the drug i eventually got .
and all these works , in some way , talk about luck or fate or chance .
i felt like i was physically present inside the shipwreck of titanic .
here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this unimaginable problem for our chefs .
this encompasses everything , the food we eat , clothing , tv , heating .
so unfortunately i &apos;m not smart enough to have a solution for the patent troll problem .
why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
but trust , in the end , is distinctive because it &apos;s given by other people .
in other words , we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier .

suddenly , lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he &apos;s resented .
i don &apos;t know what cat gut is , but let &apos;s assume it &apos;s formidable .
books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present .
i &apos;m sure many of us have had the experience of buying and returning items online .
my new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
when she collected the photos from us , she shared a bit of her story with us .
and when we &apos;re backstage , we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that .
and if you don &apos;t believe me , ask your phone company what information they store about you .
coprolites are fossilized human feces , and they &apos;re actually extremely interesting .
the teacher writes you a thank you note . the kids write you a thank you note .
so i told you that it ruins people &apos;s lives and that their friends bug them .

i feel like every time someone sneezes , new orleans has a parade .
at that moment , i heard one man &apos;s voice ask me , &quot; what &apos;s wrong ? &quot;
and as a result , patent trolls can kind of live in the space in between .

and i was like , &quot; whoa . how come i never heard of this before ? &quot;
you &apos;re in and out of traffic all day , and it &apos;s zooming around you .
now in that moment , it took everything i had not to say , &quot; i will . &quot;
new things come from what are called our weak ties , our friends of friends of friends .
one time , our bus was stopped and boarded by a chinese police officer .
but nobody helped them , because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families .
we couldn &apos;t retouch the photo unless it was cleaned , dry and reclaimed .
you just couldn &apos;t imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it affects people .
and all over europe , people stood up and said , &quot; we don &apos;t want this . &quot;
but today i will talk about me and my mobile phone , and how it changed my life .
there &apos;s actually a lot of evidence in primates and other animals that they return favors .

since we only have five minutes , it &apos;s better that we have a fast and simpler way .
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the story , i moved on .
so , i &apos;ve started to think about what these games are making us virtuosos at .
some of you might be thinking , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time to spend playing games . &quot;
and so they come together , they arrive together , they pick it up together and they pull together .
but that &apos;s not really what this is about . right ? and then i open my hand up .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe .
these heels are very uncomfortable , so good thing i wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
in california there has been a 40 percent decline in the sierra snowpack .
in the andes , this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city .

they need expertise and mentorship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses .
first , i told emma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital .
having great components is not enough , and yet we &apos;ve been obsessed in medicine with components .
we turn to technology to help us feel connected in ways we can comfortably control .

i said , &quot; miguel , aren &apos;t they feasting on your fish ? &quot;
both projects are in emerging countries , one in ethiopia and another one in tunisia .
it seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry , not emotion .
we use technology to define ourselves by sharing our thoughts and feelings even as we &apos;re having them .
and i realized new yorkers don &apos;t hold hands ; we just don &apos;t do that outside .
but today i worry about , what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks ?
and i ask you , three words , please , to improve health care : let patients help .
it &apos;s a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows .
then of course , there &apos;s all that co2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
it gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress and carry a wand .
and you &apos;re like , &quot; god , can &apos;t i just be a little disabled ? &quot;
and so i want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .
and a lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say they &apos;re crazy . that &apos;s good .
now , we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
it no longer has our natural , childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine .
in terms of the other self , the remembering self , you get a different story .
and i &apos;m afraid of many , many more things besides that people can &apos;t even guess at .
this is not an electron micrograph ; this is just a regular photomicrograph .
and that &apos;s where i &apos;m going to end my remarks , because that &apos;s where we are .
and i say to you , &quot; remember that there is a guy who is a baker . &quot;
since my family couldn &apos;t understand chinese , i thought my family was going to be arrested .
but don &apos;t you ever turn into a gaddafi-like revolutionary . &quot;

we wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world or just among wealthy countries .
they ended up in a tree , and one of them holds out a hand to the other .
postsecret.com is the most visited advertisement-free blog in the world .
they were blank on one side , and on the other side i listed some simple instructions .
o.k. but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the hell with it .
so i want to extrapolate on this idea a bit something that &apos;s a little bit crazy .
the knife , which you can examine ; my hand , which you could examine .
this is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life .
we &apos;re about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years .
and you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
so they &apos;re looking at the generic attitudes that people report when you ask them certain questions .
so we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof .
he &apos;s an amnesic who had , very possibly , the very worst memory in the world .
they were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers .
it &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s awesome , and it &apos;s not a career path .
funny thing is , the drive-thrus are killing more people than the drive-bys .
matty has found this ingenious way to leverage the kindness of strangers .
i went home , and i know you can &apos;t read the details here ; that &apos;s not important .
i &apos;m going to do an international biennial , i need artists from all around the world .
and you can go backwards , you can go forwards ; you cannot stay where you are .
as you can see , there &apos;s a bubble of air , and it &apos;s bouncing around inside .
they did , however , seem very concerned that i would starve to death during ramadan .
no . i think he &apos;s trying to say that jealousy reveals us to ourselves .
the two words come from the latin root &quot; pater , &quot; which means &quot; father . &quot;
so what we did is we put two capuchin monkeys side-by-side .
and at that time the focus in a lot of animal research was on aggression and competition .
and i discovered there that the chimpanzees are very power hungry and wrote a book about it .
so when you are done , just bring back the body and then it &apos;s ready for another session .
i was slowly losing weight , but for me , that was what the doctor told me to do .
and all together with those other 77 you &apos;re not seeing , that &apos;s my biennial .
this piece was great . this is in my parents &apos; backyard in arkansas .
and gamers are willing to work hard all the time , if they &apos;re given the right work .
we know that we are optimized , as human beings , to do hard meaningful work .
and , needless to say , thank god i wasn &apos;t using a thesaurus back then .
we &apos;ve also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of the guardian .
i have always loved the fact that my hood and my affliction share the same initials .
it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has .
it manifests in each individual differently , hence why remi is so different from sam .
okay , so the next question people always ask me is , &quot; do you get free stuff ? &quot;
here &apos;s me at a slumber party a few days before i shot french vogue .
all because they want to sound like the guy who &apos;s got the 5,000 nuclear warheads , etc .
because in the summer of 2006 , the e.u. commission tabled a directive .
so it gives us virtual access to the lungs , which is where many important diseases reside .
so we went out and found these dodgeball teams and infiltrated them .
but that same shift in perspective leads us to have less tolerance than ever for injustice .
the most mentally sharp older adults are the ones who show this positivity effect the most .
that is that younger people today may not typically experience these improvements as they grow older .
and these goals aren &apos;t necessarily diametrically opposed , but they are at odds .
this is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles into a single system .
now the good news is some of this work has already begun in different parts of the world .
so when i was born , i guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me .
and i saw , &quot; aha , that &apos;s the kidney and the soleus muscle . &quot;
this is the way bonobos do it . bonobos do everything with sex .
i think the greatest adversity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy .
this question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer , by building siftables .
they can do that because when they are very cold they are what &apos;s called superconducting wire .
one effect , paradoxically , is that it produces paralysis , rather than liberation .
i teach wonderfully intelligent students , and i assign 20 percent less work than i used to .
so we collaborated with the egyptian scientists to do coring work , which you see here .
by that i simply mean how fast we &apos;re used to moving in the contemporary day and age .
only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as powerless as i was .
takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurologist &apos;s clinic to do it .
so the last question people ask me is , &quot; what is it like to be a model ? &quot;
who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution ? universities ? forget about it !
you can learn a lot about ancient diet and intestinal disease , but they are very rare .
it &apos;s as though we &apos;re using them as spare parts to support our fragile sense of self .
and as a result , it &apos;s an entirely different use of the technology and the knowledge around you .
it &apos;s already a big advance over many other animals who wouldn &apos;t be able to do that .
the disabled are the largest — yeah , clap for that , man . c &apos;mon .
here we are , four years later , you can &apos;t find a website that gives patients that information .
and within this project , he &apos;s doing a smaller project called &quot; artists in residence . &quot;
and what that is is i imagine explaining a work of art to my grandmother in five minutes .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , at walt disney concert hall .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not do it for content as well ?
because i had to , at a certain point , say , &quot; what am i doing out here ?
they do that because they &apos;re able to follow the broken white line of highway a92 .
so three very tough problems that might be solvable , and so , should be worked on .
and i started to notice a few things that make epic wins so possible in online worlds .
this grew into a passion for finding things , a love for the past and archaeology .
in fact , this week i went to see a very high-quality movie , &quot; argo . &quot;
in fact , i aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy .
and this is the result that is almost like a combination of the european block and the arab city .
and also it has this idea of the public space that uses the outdoors to create activity .
everybody who competes in this contest will tell you that they have just an average memory .
so the question you want to ask is : how come ? why ? what is it about them ?
and i turn around , and it &apos;s this older man . i have no idea who he is .
and , perhaps , until we &apos;re tested , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of .
this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child .
if they get surrounded , they notice that too , they might get a little flustered .
you offer 50 funds -- 10 percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five . why ?
that new piece of capital , that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle .
so on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tremor .
and everybody got insanely bored , actually , because this debate went on for three weeks .
and other research has shown that older people seem to engage with sadness more comfortably .
i believe this wish reflects a painful truth that i &apos;ve learned in the past 15 years .
we &apos;ve got 90 post-op patient years between us , and we haven &apos;t had a single problem .
but for me , absolutely the best point is there is no anticoagulation therapy required .
when we produced that model we turn it into a solid plastic model , as you can see ,
well , the heart beats , rhythmically , tirelessly , faithfully .
and i was longing for several things that i wasn &apos;t getting , or not getting enough of .
i decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year .
but , as a result now , he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes .
i was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook .
so , instead of worrying about them , you just take that . it &apos;s a great thing .
and the answer is that , until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
the reason i &apos;m holding onto my wrist is because that &apos;s actually the secret of the illusion .
all you have to say is , &quot; make words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
maybe we can &apos;t just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18 minute speech .
they &apos;ve changed us culturally , and i would argue that they &apos;ve changed us cognitively .
so , in a frenzy , i corrected everybody &apos;s marks , not imaginatively .
and what we do , we become friends , and we find out what that person wants to do .
i was caught off guard when stephen colbert asked me a profound question , a profound question .
people talk to me about the important new skill of making eye contact while you &apos;re texting .
as a body architect , i fascinate with the human body and explore how i can transform it .
for the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the seas like we clear-cut forests .
and it &apos;s best if multiple succeed , because then you could use a mix of these things .
it is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life .
and the one that is worse was the one where pain was at its peak at the very end .
i had very low -- i had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor .
and because you are possessed , you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be harmed ?
so , you might ask : why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge ?
so just to take some quick examples : people text or do email during corporate board meetings .
also , i gotta tell you , i got 99 problems , and palsy is just one .
words , like numbers , express fundamental relationships between objects and events and forces that constitute our world .
but before long , my supervisor pushed me to push alex about her love life .
so a flight from conversation can really matter because it can compromise our capacity for self-reflection .
we remove ourselves from our grief or from our revery and we go into our phones .
and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions .
are they saying there &apos;s negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things ?
one &apos;s a claim : there has been a great decline in trust , very widely believed .
other teams , we give them money to spend on their dodgeball teammates .
60 percent of our asthma , stroke patients receive incomplete or inappropriate care .
and that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some agriculture .
growing up , there were only six arabs in my town , and they were all my family .
even though adjusting to life in south korea was not easy , i made a plan .
as my team leader wynne once said , it &apos;s like doing a tattoo on someone .
we western donor countries have given the african continent two trillion american dollars in the last 50 years .
in day-to-day life , this translates into greater enjoyment and satisfaction .
i was raised in the forests of british columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut .
but going to mars would follow a political decision with popular appeal , and that will never happen .
but kennedy &apos;s own words at rice university in 1962 provide a better clue .
if there was an oppression olympics , i would win the gold medal .
besides , the best time to work on alex &apos;s marriage is before she has one . &quot;
as you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
and the zambians said , &quot; yes , that &apos;s why we have no agriculture here . &quot;
and just like every sunday , we started reading the secrets out loud to each other . &quot;
and he coined this term e-patients -- equipped , engaged , empowered , enabled .
there are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system .
it just wants to get past you , so it &apos;s often the motorist is not paying attention .
and if i &apos;m going to be really honest , they &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;ll ever be .
co2 is warming the planet , and the equation on co2 is actually a very straightforward one .
and so , recently , scientists have suggested that herodotus &apos;s crazy story is actually true .
and , even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences .
and the question that i want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
the result of which is that everywhere i go now , people treat me like i &apos;m doomed .
you don &apos;t want to pick the wrong mutual fund , or even the wrong salad dressing .
this is &quot; bleak house &quot; by dickens . every column is a chapter .
i was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that i was standing near the cowshed .
on another day we wake up to the news of the assassination of army officers .
i don &apos;t take any drugs at all other than recreational ones that i would choose to take .
and this effect is very pleasant on the mind , and it helps the sentence to feel right .
so , i decided i was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 15 .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re getting queasy , look away , don &apos;t look at the thing .
the symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west .
but these stories bothered me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i did .
and then my supervisor said , &quot; not yet , but she might marry the next one .
go a couple generations forward to where we are , though , and it looks like a completely different world .
well to sum up , it boils down to one thing : don &apos;t negotiate with terrorists .
when paul speaks in a public hearing , he can &apos;t testify without armed guards .
now , if you &apos;re not a gamer you might miss some of the nuance in this photo .
sometimes i see a lot of it , sometimes there &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who aren &apos;t new yorkers , i apologize .
so , we have a dense layer of occupation dating to the middle kingdom at this site .
and i &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
and so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them to thrive .
no , no , if i want to i can say , &quot; i &apos;m a novelist . &quot;
i &apos;m going to fast-forward through a lot of lawsuits and a lot of community engagement .
and so the net result is that we do better in general , objectively , and we feel worse .
when they came in 100 flavors , damn it , one of them should &apos;ve been perfect .
and those of you who are interested , may want to go to marshmallowchallenge.com .
maybe too much time , considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world .
so i thought , this is what i really want to design , not a shopping mall .
i &apos;d like you to notice the color of the door , the material that it &apos;s made out of .
it had never occurred to me , china doesn &apos;t have to be at the center of the world .
no one &apos;s ever refused , and luckily no one &apos;s ever run off with our camera .
and the first idea i got was to use fire , because i thought lions were scared of fire .
but the second answer , and what i really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; why ?
i worked for an italian ngo , and every single project that we set up in africa failed .
there &apos;s plenty of time for us to reconsider how we use it , how we build it .
and we &apos;re afraid , like young lovers , that too much talking might spoil the romance .
and would we revert back to being more like animals , more primal modes of communication ?
&quot; inside this envelope is the ripped up remains of a suicide note i didn &apos;t use .
so with this anatomage table , students can experience the dissection without a human cadaver .
and if you look in that red oval , that shadow was not supposed to be there .
well if 100 , if we think of 100 as being like a square , 75 would look like this .
do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable ?
now i &apos;ve been googling -- i &apos;ve been online since 1989 on compuserv .
if you ask for the happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
and , if this is true , and i think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
think of this : we have a four-letter genetic code -- a , c , g and t .
when each of you in this room were born , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet .
is he picking up on the fact that luke joins an army to overthrow the government ?
in short , in our real lives , we seek to place trust in a differentiated way .
he was the basis for dustin hoffman &apos;s character in the movie &quot; rain man . &quot;
jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive .
and she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five-year-old standing in that exact spot .
now , i live in new orleans , and i am in love with new orleans .
it has very good time resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
there &apos;s a lovely story that i read in a futurist magazine many , many years ago .
the second one is that the partner is willing to work even though he &apos;s not interested in the food .
and in the case of the flora in our gut , these cells may not even be human .
and this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world has never seen before .
and i always just say , &quot; oh , i was scouted , &quot; but that means nothing .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff , like cassava for instance .
other people will do that for you , don &apos;t do it to yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself .
i was imagining a march of the penguins thing , so i looked at miguel .
he &apos;s an amazing guy , three parts charles darwin and one part crocodile dundee .
that &apos;s sort of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet .

what could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children ?
across the last few decades , we &apos;ve tried to construct systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions and professionals and officials and so on that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness .
i would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people , anywhere in the world , particularly in developing areas , who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world .

and in 1992 i participated in a genetic study and found to my horror , as you can see from the slide , that my ascending aorta was not in the normal range , the green line at the bottom .
i want to spend a day in the life of a jihadi gangster who wears his jihad against the communists like popstar bling and uses armed religious intimidation and political corruption to make himself rich .
and i definitely know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption , particularly given the circumstance that i &apos;m in right now in my career .
and there are , fortunately now , dozens of companies , we need it to be hundreds , who , likewise , if their science goes well , if the funding for their pilot plants goes well , that they can compete for this .

john pepper , bless his heart , professor of cardiothoracic surgery -- never done it before in his life -- he put the first one in , didn &apos;t like it , took it out , put the second one in .
i worked with a synthetic biologist , and i created a swallowable perfume , which is a cosmetic pill that you eat and the fragrance comes out through the skin &apos;s surface when you perspire .

you &apos;re doing it for the task itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is , for the thrill of discovery , and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team .
and it turns out that , below an income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , like 600,000 , but it &apos;s a large representative sample , below an income of 600,000 dollars a year ...
but the third thing you can learn , and this is the really important one , this is the point i want to leave you on , is that the title , president of the united states of america , doesn &apos;t sound that humble at all these days , does it ?
so i wrote a story about that too , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; frankenfoods , &quot; why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a haphazard way , was trespassing on nature &apos;s ground .
and there was a time when jeans came in one flavor , and you bought them , and they fit like crap , and they were incredibly uncomfortable , and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times , they started to feel ok .
now , remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nanosecond — that &apos;s how much time it takes for light to travel — but i &apos;m slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion .
and when we &apos;re in game worlds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves , the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s notice , the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again .
our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share our hopes , fears and stories , the people around us can not only help us make better places , they can help us lead better lives .
students can use this as a tool to learn about the complex concepts such as planetary motion , physics , and unlike computer screens or textbooks , this is a real , tangible experience that you can touch and feel , and it &apos;s very powerful .
when charles darwin went across the atlantic in 1832 on the beagle , he saw the turkey vulture , and he said , &quot; these are disgusting birds with bald scarlet heads that are formed to revel in putridity . &quot;
the kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the north korean people when we needed it most , and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we north korean people need .
societies with millions of talented , emotionally stable citizens who are healthier and better educated than any generations before them , armed with knowledge about the practical matters of life and motivated to solve the big issues can be better societies than we have ever known .
and we had a mix of dumb stuff on there -- making sure an antibiotic is given in the right time frame because that cuts the infection rate by half -- and then interesting stuff , because you can &apos;t make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery .
when you think of processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimize processes to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals , new vaccines , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science .
my great grandfather once said before he invented the model t , &quot; if i had asked people then what they wanted , they would have answered , &apos; we want faster horses . &apos; &quot; so the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads .
and taking them down so that they had access astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments , taking them down to the vents , and letting them see , and take samples and test instruments , and so on .
that was when i realized that this sort of benign neglect was a real problem , and it had real consequences , not just for alex and her love life but for the careers and the families and the futures of twentysomethings everywhere .
take , for example , this child of a barasana in the northwest amazon , the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
when i went to the site , the first design operation we did was to extend the existing streets , creating 12 initial blocks similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in barcelona and other cities in europe with these courtyards .
and may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-human futures that i can imagine , as a science fiction fan .
we think that polemics -- -- we think that polemics are not persuasive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world . we get 35 million hits on our website every month .
but we &apos;ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
and it &apos;s within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish . and there are great moments of optimism .
i &apos;m an archeological geneticist at the center for evolutionary medicine at the university of zurich , and i study the origins and evolution of human health and disease by conducting genetic research on the skeletal and mummified remains of ancient humans .
now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
we &apos;ve got quite a few scenes of the men having deep , angst-ridden conversations in this hideout , and the great moment for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and say , &quot; are you coming to bed , honey ? &quot;
why ? because they looked at the curve and said , if the population keeps growing at this rate , to move the population of new york around , they would have needed six million horses , and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with .
how much are we willing to lose from our already short lives by losing ourselves in our blackberries , our iphones , by not paying attention to the human being across from us who is talking with us , by being so lazy that we &apos;re not willing to process deeply ?
finally , one consequence of buying a bad-fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear : the world is responsible . what could you do ?
and then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system -- speakers , cd player , tape player , tuner , amplifier -- and in this one single consumer electronics store , there are that many stereo systems .
but in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big reductions , is only equally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs .
turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate , even when i matched them on every characteristic i could measure , things like family income , standardized achievement test scores , even how safe kids felt when they were at school .
one in particular , a photo of women of all ages , from grandmother to little girl , gathered around a baby , struck a chord , because a similar photo from my family , my grandmother and mother , myself , and newborn daughter , hangs on our wall .
the reason i have a ridiculous pinata there is one of the teams pooled their money and bought a pinata , and they all got around and smashed the pinata and all the candy fell out and things like that .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work , you could actually extend the colonoscopy of patient a by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much .
in my broken english , and with a dictionary , i explained the situation , and without hesitating , the man went to the atm and he paid the rest of the money for my family and two other north koreans to get out of jail .
and yet , i actually think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the enlightenment , to find a time when we battled progress , when we fought about these things more vigorously , on more fronts , than we do now .
what kindergarteners do differently , is that they start with the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , successive prototypes , always keeping the marshmallow on top , so they have multiple times to fix ill built prototypes along the way .
he skinned the dog and improvised a harness , took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled , harnessed up an adjacent dog , and disappeared over the ice floes , shit knife in belt .
how , in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants , do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way , created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
i think morality is much more than what i &apos;ve been talking about , but it would be impossible without these ingredients that we find in other primates , which are empathy and consolation , pro-social tendencies and reciprocity and a sense of fairness .
you might have a lobar pneumonia , for example , and they could give you an antiserum , an injection of rabid antibodies to the bacterium streptococcus , if the intern sub-typed it correctly .
this year is the centennial of his masterpiece , &quot; in search of lost time , &quot; and it &apos;s the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy and just regular competitiveness , my brand , that we can hope to have .
actually , my student thanasis , i have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy .
i thought it was only us italians blundering around africa , but then i saw what the americans were doing , what the english were doing , what the french were doing , and after seeing what they were doing , i became quite proud of our project in zambia .
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma genitalium , that has the smallest genome for a species that can self-replicate in the laboratory , and we &apos;ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome .
i would clean off my arm , and i would show you that there are no wounds , but i think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real , i &apos;m just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
so maybe the idea i want to put out there is , not so much overcoming adversity , as it is opening ourselves up to it , embracing it , grappling with it , to use a wrestling term , maybe even dancing with it .
and this gap has become shorter , shorter , and even shorter , and now this gap is shortened down to less than a millimeter , the thickness of a touch-screen glass , and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone .
what this shows is that at this possible location of itjtawy , five meters down , we have of layer of occupation for several hundred years dating to the middle kingdom , dating to the exact period of time we think itjtawy is .

the spirits can be invoked from beneath the great water , responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living , so that for that brief shining moment , the acolyte becomes the god .
because there are no vultures , there &apos;s been a spread in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites , and when you have feral dogs , you have a huge time bomb of rabies . the number of cases of rabies has increased tremendously in india .
what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down , so that instead of one thing to the next , we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
the oil shortage is fictional , but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve run out of oil . so , when you come to the game you sign up , you tell us where you live .
and then every day , smart , interesting twentysomethings like you or like your sons and daughters come into my office and say things like this : &quot; i know my boyfriend &apos;s no good for me , but this relationship doesn &apos;t count . i &apos;m just killing time . &quot;
now , tom ripley goes from wanting you or wanting what you have to being you and having what you once had , and you &apos;re under the floorboards , he &apos;s answering to your name , he &apos;s wearing your rings , emptying your bank account .
but in our game , instead of just having five people on the dream team , we said everybody is on the dream team , and it &apos;s your job to invent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of health , the future of security and the future of the social safety net .
president nixon declared war on cancer in 1971 , but we soon discovered there are many kinds of cancer , most of them fiendishly resistant to therapy , and it is only in the last 10 years that effective , viable therapies have come to seem real .
the coal revolution fueled the industrial revolution , and , even in the 1900 &apos;s we &apos;ve seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air-conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
and i think if there &apos;s one thing that i want to leave you with , it &apos;s what e.p. , the amnesic who couldn &apos;t even remember that he had a memory problem , left me with , which is the notion that our lives are the sum of our memories .
for her , despite all of this , those photos were the perfect gift back to him , something he could look at again , something he remembered from before that wasn &apos;t still scarred from that day in march when absolutely everything else in his life had changed or been destroyed .
and , because i was born without the fibula bone , and had feet turned in , and a few toes in this foot , and a few toes in that , he had to be the bearer , this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news .
i mean , from this entry , it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them , when , in fact , today i &apos;m celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life has procured .
when we look at its metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me , this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would yield a living cell .
this is how i &apos;ve started to think , and this is certainly how i &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months as i &apos;ve been working on the book that will soon be published , as the dangerously , frighteningly over-anticipated follow up to my freakish success .
we make skinny models skinnier , perfect skin more perfect , and the impossible possible , and we get criticized in the press all the time , but some of us are actually talented artists with years of experience and a real appreciation for images and photography .
if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years , i could pick who &apos;s president , i could pick a vaccine , which is something i love , or i could pick that this thing that &apos;s half the cost with no co2 gets invented , this is the wish i would pick .
over and over i hear , &quot; i would rather text than talk . &quot; and what i &apos;m seeing is that people get so used to being short-changed out of real conversation , so used to getting by with less , that they &apos;ve become almost willing to dispense with people altogether .
and she thought , &quot; you know , if i have a nutrition facts label on the side of a cereal box , why can &apos;t there be something that simple telling every new nurse who comes on duty , every new doctor , the basics about my husband &apos;s condition ? &quot;
i think i should want to , but actually i &apos;d rather just do things on my blackberry . &quot; across the generations , i see that people can &apos;t get enough of each other , if and only if they can have each other at a distance , in amounts they can control .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experiencing self of patient a worse off , and you have the remembering self of patient a and lot better off , because now you have endowed patient a with a better story about his experience .
if we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility , or potency , to be even a little bit more dangerous , we can release the power of so many more children , and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
and it &apos;s well illustrated by a nifty paradox known as the baker / baker paradox , which goes like this : if i tell two people to remember the same word , if i say to you , &quot; remember that there is a guy named baker . &quot;
there are the new world vultures that are mainly found in the americas , like the condors and the caracaras , and then the old world vultures , where we have 16 species . from these 16 , 11 of them are facing a high risk of extinction .
so , not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water purification plant , and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
now the funny thing is that sarah brosnan , who &apos;s been doing this with chimpanzees , had a couple of combinations of chimpanzees where , indeed , the one who would get the grape would refuse the grape until the other guy also got a grape .
now if you give the partner grapes -- the food preferences of my capuchin monkeys correspond exactly with the prices in the supermarket -- and so if you give them grapes -- it &apos;s a far better food -- then you create inequity between them .
and if you would choose a different vacation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious because , if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer .
but it would be worse , except for that i happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when i first started telling people -- when i was a teenager -- that i wanted to be a writer , i was met with this same kind of , sort of fear-based reaction .
because -- in the end it &apos;s like this , o.k. -- centuries ago in the deserts of north africa , people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours , until dawn .
so basically , if you want to meet with me , you know , if you want to meet , don &apos;t call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit -- where you talk about doing some shit .
funding barriers : another big area to be concerned with . a big problem with understanding one of those perspectives : when we first approached one of the big u.k. charitable organizations that funds this kind of stuff , what they were looking at was essentially an engineering proposal .
and through playing music and talking about music this man had transformed from the paranoid , disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown los angeles , to the charming , erudite , brilliant , juilliard-trained musician .
for some time i have been interested in the placebo effect , which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that i do , which is &quot; something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . &quot;
so , what we do is we send that bullet , those packet of photons , millions of times , and record again and again with very clever synchronization , and from the gigabytes of data , we computationally weave together to create those femto-videos i showed you .
and she was thinking about her friends and family who work in chaos-ridden places and developing countries , and she was thinking , what can i make that would be of value to them , in case something bad happens and they have to buy their way across the border or pay off a gunman .
and it really struck me as the years went by , in a very negative way , when i would go to some stream that i &apos;d loved , and was used to walking through this field that was once filled with fireflies , and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it .
now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . foxp2 , for example .
people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , &quot; well yeah , that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there &apos;s a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be bleeding .
what you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to take all the co2 , after you &apos;ve burned it , going out the flue , pressurize it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it stays there .
i believe a significant -- not the only , but a significant -- contributor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they &apos;re at fault .
and she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her , she could collect it and grab it on the page .
and i know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; great , let &apos;s make that language yoruba . let &apos;s make it cantonese .
we traced genealogies back eight generations , and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it , they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we speared him anyway .
and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere , and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations , intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness .
and of course , barring surgery , or the fake tan that i got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is superficial and immutable , has a huge impact on our lives .
and in a miracle , he lifted his own violin , and he started playing , by ear , certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete , mendelssohn , tchaikovsky , sibelius .
and we were talking about this , and you know , tom , for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist , trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses that were totally internalized .
so , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , co2 , that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the services each person &apos;s using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the co2 being put out per unit of energy .
as we did some of our subsequent expeditions i was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them .
so you get in your car , and as you get in your car , your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive -- no more driving around looking for one , which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel in today &apos;s cars in urban areas is looking for parking spots .
and i crack up at this piece , because when i see it i know that &apos;s french angora and all antique german ribbons and wool that i got in a nebraska mill and carried around for 10 years and then antique chinese skirts .
now , all these photos had been damaged by water , submerged in salt water , covered in bacteria , in sewage , sometimes even in oil , all of which over time is going to continue to damage them , so hand-cleaning them was a huge part of the project .
they are constructions , and they are constructions by a group of professionals , by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production , and they build this . that &apos;s not me .
the reason is that they &apos;re getting poisoned , and the reason that they &apos;re getting poisoned is because there &apos;s human-wildlife conflicts . the pastoral communities are using this poison to target predators , and in return , the vultures are falling victim to this .
you know , genocide , the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned , but ethnocide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not condemned , it &apos;s universally , in many quarters , celebrated as part of a development strategy .
he said to me , &quot; i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence , and you &apos;ve been making liar out of me ever since . &quot;
and , one day , he came in to my session -- exhaustive and unforgiving , these sessions -- and he said to me , &quot; wow . aimee , you are such a strong , powerful little girl , i think you &apos;re going to break one of those bands .
and so what we do in the next step is we release one elephant before the other , and that elephant needs to be smart enough to stay there and wait and not pull at the rope -- because if he pulls at the rope , it disappears and the whole test is over .
and then there is a remembering self , and the remembering self is the one that keeps score , and maintains the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question , &quot; how have you been feeling lately ? &quot;
so , she &apos;s running to the house and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the poem passes through her , and she grabs a pencil just as it &apos;s going through her , and then she said , it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it .
on the day after september 11 in 2001 , i heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street , and i grabbed my infant son and i ran downstairs and there was a man doing his paper recycling route like he did every wednesday .
and it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience i &apos;ve ever had , because i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it , because i had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
regarding the word &quot; patient , &quot; when i first started a few years ago getting involved in health care and attending meetings as just a casual observer , i noticed that people would talk about patients as if it was somebody who &apos;s not in the room here , somebody out there .
we have tools at our disposal like &quot; girl power , &quot; and we hope that that will help , but i gotta wonder , is girl power going to protect them if , at the same time , actively or passively , we are training our sons to maintain their boy power ?
in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or , indeed , a prognosis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don &apos;t put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable someone .
but unfortunately i have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired nyu ph.d. student counted all the models on the runway , every single one that was hired , and of the 677 models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non-white .
the neolithic revolution -- which gave us agriculture , at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed ; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood ; we created hierarchy specialization surplus -- is only 10,000 years ago .
if the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides , as if she was yelling frantically , &quot; help ! i &apos;m on fire ! &quot; -- this symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame , but i like to think that way . whichever works for you .
and he said , &quot; we have the cowboys stationed at distinct places all around . &quot; they communicate electronically constantly , and they have protocols and checklists for how they handle everything -- -- from bad weather to emergencies or inoculations for the cattle .
and so by applying ancient dna sequencing and protein mass spectrometry technologies to ancient dental calculus , we can generate immense quantities of data that then we can use to begin to reconstruct a detailed picture of the dynamic interplay between diet , infection and immunity thousands of years ago .
my first gig was driving famous comics from new york city to shows in new jersey , and i &apos;ll never forget the face of the first comic i ever drove when he realized that he was speeding down the new jersey turnpike with a chick with c.p. driving him .
summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me , so i drank deer &apos;s milk , i had hot cups on my back , i was dunked in the dead sea , and i remember the water burning my eyes and thinking , &quot; it &apos;s working ! it &apos;s working ! &quot;
however , there are 6.3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with incurable weakness , tremor , rigidity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
i encourage all of you to read steve &apos;s book , or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bond , and ultimately was instrumental , if you &apos;ll pardon the pun , in helping nathaniel get off the streets .
we have groups of volunteers supporting the enterprise facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion , the energy and imagination of your own people .
so what that means is that people will be able to — people will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with parkinson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .
those may make some contribution , and if they can do better than i expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look daunting , because they all have significant challenges .
v.c.s have always struggled to invest profitably in technologies such as energy whose capital requirements are huge and whose development is long and lengthy , and v.c.s have never , never funded the development of technologies meant to solve big problems that possess no immediate commercial value .
a different book was written not too long ago in the mid-90s called &quot; touched with fire &quot; by kay redfield jamison in which it was looked at in a creative sense in which mozart and beethoven and van gogh all have this manic depression that they were suffering with .
and other times she wouldn &apos;t be fast enough , so she &apos;d be running and running and running , and she wouldn &apos;t get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape , looking , as she put it &quot; for another poet . &quot;
and , of course , the most successful studio of all time continues to crank out classic after classic , every single one of them about the journey of a boy , or a man , or two men who are friends , or a man and his son , or two men who are raising a little girl .
to actually do the software , buy the supercomputer , hire all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a russian reactor to make sure our materials work properly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
but we don &apos;t even blink when we hear somebody say this because we &apos;ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we &apos;ve completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry , in the end , will always ultimately lead to anguish .
and the peculiar thing is that i recently wrote this book , this memoir called &quot; eat , pray , love &quot; which , decidedly unlike any of my previous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , mega-sensation , international bestseller thing .
and then the renaissance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was let &apos;s put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine .
as i looked through the photos , there were some were over a hundred years old , some still in the envelope from the processing lab , i couldn &apos;t help but think as a re<unk> that i could fix that tear and mend that scratch , and i knew hundreds of people who could do the same .
but the process , and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie , the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble , and released it kind of back where it came from , and realized that this didn &apos;t have to be this internalized , tormented thing .
i want fewer quests where my son is told , &quot; go out and fight it alone , &quot; and more quests where he sees that it &apos;s his job to join a team , maybe a team led by women , to help other people become better and be better people , like the wizard of oz .
in your kitchen , the floor has been paved over with a yellow brick road and out of your oven are coming towards you dorothy , the tin man , the scarecrow and the lion from &quot; the wizard of oz , &quot; hand-in-hand skipping straight towards you .
now i had hoped to team up with some of these larger companies in order to defend against this lawsuit , but one-by-one they settled out of the case , even though -- and this is important -- none of these companies infringed on this patent -- not a one of them .
now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full percentage , that will be very tricky , and agreeing on where these co2 quantities should be put will be hard , but the toughest one here is this long term issue .
what simonides figured out at that moment is something that i think we all kind of intuitively know , which is that , as bad as we are at remembering names and phone numbers and word-for-word instructions from our colleagues , we have really exceptional visual and spatial memories .
with an amazing group of women , i co-founded the libyan women &apos;s platform for peace , a movement of women , leaders , from different walks of life , to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace .
on one vancouver morning , we went out on the campus at university of british columbia and we approached people and said , &quot; do you want to be in an experiment ? &quot; they said , &quot; yes . &quot; we asked them how happy they were , and then we gave them an envelope .
and you know that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever i wasn &apos;t in school i was out in the woods , hiking and taking &quot; samples , &quot; frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water , and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscope .
so l.a. times got ahold of it . steve lopez did a story on it and talked to the councilman , and one of the green grounds members , they put up a petition on change.org , and with 900 signatures , we were a success .
we &apos;ve all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory using a set of ancient techniques , techniques invented 2,500 years ago in greece , the same techniques that cicero had used to memorize his speeches , that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books . &quot;
and he &apos;s speeding along , and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of melody , that comes into his head as inspiration often comes , elusive and tantalizing , and he wants it , you know , it &apos;s gorgeous , and he longs for it , but he has no way to get it .
an ad campaign promises that online and with avatars , you can &quot; finally , love your friends love your body , love your life , online and with avatars . &quot; we &apos;re drawn to virtual romance , to computer games that seem like worlds , to the idea that robots , robots , will someday be our true companions .
you know , one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stones polished by rain , taste it in the bitter leaves of plants .
he was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton , and how the dodgers were never going to make the world series , all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement in beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
a very silly , trivial thing to do , but think of the difference on a team that didn &apos;t do that at all , that got 15 euro , put it in their pocket , maybe bought themselves a coffee , or teams that had this prosocial experience where they all bonded together to buy something and do a group activity .
proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd , but it is , at its crux , a quest for knowledge , a quest for truth , painful truth , and actually , where proust is concerned , the more painful the truth , the better .
but the one moment that stands out the most was when i got -- before this moment -- — but the one moment that stands out the most was when i got to perform for the man who floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee , has parkinson &apos;s and shakes just like me , muhammad ali .
they believed that a genius was this , sort of magical divine entity , who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio , kind of like dobby the house elf , and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work .
i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing , it was so ludicrous , but i just i &apos;d just gotten past mangled , and my voice broke , and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed .
now i know we can develop the technology that &apos;s going to make this work , but we &apos;ve got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions -- whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven &apos;t even thought of yet , our overall transportation mix and infrastructure must support all the future options .
go to the website and start yourself on the process of thinking , again , less about &quot; how can i spend money on myself ? &quot; and more about &quot; if i &apos;ve got five dollars or 15 dollars , what can i do to benefit other people ? &quot; because ultimately when you do that , you &apos;ll find that you &apos;ll benefit yourself much more .
no one has traveled faster than the crew of apollo 10 , and blithe optimism about technology &apos;s powers has evaporated as big problems we had imagined technology would solve , such as going to mars , creating clean energy , curing cancer , or feeding the world have come to seem intractably hard .
so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
&quot; everyone who knew me before 9 / 11 believes i &apos;m dead . &quot; &quot; i used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people , so sometimes i didn &apos;t wear panties , and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself . &quot; this next one takes a little explanation before i share it with you .
there &apos;s evidence that neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury , and , perhaps , because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community : they didn &apos;t view these people as broken and useless ; they were seen as rare and valuable .
and , as i &apos;ve been looking over the last year for models for how to do that i &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people , sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity .
the aim , i think , is more trustworthiness , and that is going to be different if we are trying to be trustworthy and communicate our trustworthiness to other people , and if we are trying to judge whether other people or office-holders or politicians are trustworthy .
so we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes , in bars , and your dedicated buddies who will do to you , what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic , somebody who will say to you , &quot; what do you need ?
so you see these astonishing demonstrations : voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity , a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation .
whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape , we either invoke rousseau and the old canard of the &quot; noble savage , &quot; which is an idea racist in its simplicity , or alternatively , we invoke thoreau and say these people are closer to the earth than we are .
if you had early signs of paralysis and you were really good at asking personal questions , you might figure out that this paralysis someone has is from syphilis , in which case you could give this nice concoction of mercury and arsenic -- as long as you didn &apos;t overdose them and kill them .
he doesn &apos;t remember if he stole my chocolate bar , but he remembers the year of release for every song on my ipod , conversations we had when he was four , weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of teletubbies , and lady gaga &apos;s birthday .
descendants of the ancient tairona civilization which once carpeted the caribbean coastal plain of colombia , in the wake of the conquest , these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the caribbean coastal plain .
so the moral of all this is , we need to think much less about trust , let alone about attitudes of trust detected or mis-detected by opinion polls , much more about being trustworthy , and how you give people adequate , useful and simple evidence that you &apos;re trustworthy .
unfortunately after you &apos;ve gone to school , and you have a résumé and you &apos;ve done a few jobs , you can &apos;t say anything anymore , so if you say you want to be the president of the united states , but your résumé reads , &quot; underwear model : 10 years , &quot; people give you a funny look .
but we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome -- it &apos;s over 580,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we &apos;d build them in cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are .
there &apos;s always one continent left out , the assumption being that sub-saharan africa had no religious beliefs . well , of course , they did and voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic diaspora of the slavery era .
i decided when i was 27 years old to only respond to people , and i invented a system called enterprise facilitation , where you never initiate anything , you never motivate anybody , but you become a servant of the local passion , the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person .
and since then , i &apos;ve conducted about 70 design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects , even the ctos of the fortune 50 , and there &apos;s something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and i &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
in fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not , and so it &apos;s through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that , yes , with the right material &apos;s approach , this looks like it would work .
but as they work together , something starts to change , and finally in &quot; the adventure of the six napoleons , &quot; once holmes comes in , dazzles everybody with his solution , lestrade turns to holmes and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not jealous of you , mr. holmes .
now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in afghanistan , but personally i don &apos;t want to paint rainbows ; i want to make art that disturbs identity and challenges authority and exposes hypocrisy and reinterprets reality and even uses kind of an imaginative ethnography to try and understand the world that we live in .
one of the major problems with patent law is that , in the case that when you are sued by a patent troll , the burden of proof that you did not infringe on the patent is actually on the defendant , which means you have to prove that you do not infringe on the patent they &apos;re suing you on .
in the early &apos; 80s , i had a really astonishing assignment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to haiti , infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of duvalier &apos;s strength and tonton macoutes , and securing the poison used to make zombies .
the older ladies sometimes hadn &apos;t seen a scanner before , but within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo , they could give it to us , have it scanned , uploaded to a cloud server , it would be downloaded by a gaijin , a stranger , somewhere on the other side of the globe , and it &apos;d start being fixed .
they sketch and they lay out spaghetti they spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures and then , finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the marshmallow , and then they gingerly put it on top , and then they stand back , and ta-da !
it means that a young kid from the andes who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined .
just be manic enough in which investors who are looking for entrepreneurs that have this kind of spectrum -- you know what i &apos;m talking about -- not maybe full bipolar , but they &apos;re in the bipolar spectrum -- where on one side , maybe you think you &apos;re jesus , and on the other side maybe they just make you a lot of money .
the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years , and there are now efforts to measure the two separately , the gallup organization has a world poll with more that half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences .
over the last few millenia we &apos;ve invented a series of technologies -- from the alphabet to the scroll to the codex , the printing press , photography , the computer , the smartphone -- that have made it progressively easier and easier for us to externalize our memories , for us to essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity .
now , of course , this was a simple ploy on dr. p &apos;s part to get me to do the exercises i didn &apos;t want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year-old in the second floor ward , but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me .
well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
the idea behind the memory palace is to create this imagined edifice in your mind &apos;s eye and populate it with images of the things that you want to remember -- the crazier , weirder , more bizarre , funnier , raunchier , stinkier the image is , the more unforgettable it &apos;s likely to be .
you know , i think that allowing somebody , one mere person to believe that he or she is like , the vessel , you know , like the font and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , unknowable , eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile , human psyche .
in south asia , in countries like india and pakistan , four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered , which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct , and the reason is because they are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a painkilling drug like diclofenac .
&quot; when people i love leave voicemails on my phone i always save them in case they die tomorrow and i have no other way of hearing their voice ever again . &quot; when i posted this secret , dozens of people sent voicemail messages from their phones , sometimes ones they &apos;d been keeping for years , messages from family or friends who had died .
what i &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as i can , is some foundational work , some new technology that we brought to microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago . this is seadragon , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data .
curious historical footnote -- when the moors invaded southern spain , they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from &quot; allah , allah , allah , &quot; to &quot; ole , ole , ole , &quot; which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances .
by shining one laser , we can record one raw photo , which , you look on the screen , doesn &apos;t really make any sense , but then we will take a lot of such pictures , dozens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ?
it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose , then the one that chooses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be chosen .
and i wound up getting involved with the space community , really involved with nasa , sitting on the nasa advisory board , planning actual space missions , going to russia , going to the pre-cosmonaut biomedical protocols , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3d camera systems .
if i can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts , and , instead of thinking about information overload , what i &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible .
but unfortunately , as we &apos;re on our way to solving one monstrous problem -- and as i said , we &apos;re not there yet ; we &apos;ve got a lot of work to do , but i can see where we will -- but even as we &apos;re in the process of doing that , another huge problem is looming , and people aren &apos;t noticing .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the co2 constraints , then the skeptics say , okay , i don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out co2 , i kind of wish it did put out co2 , but i guess i &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than what &apos;s come before .
in the case of gooseberry natural resources , this patent on emailing news releases had sort of a fatal flaw as it pertained to myself , and that was that in the mainstream media world there is only one definition for news release , and it turns out that is press release -- as in p.r .
175 salad dressings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 extra-virgin olive oils and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings , in the off-chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you .
an 18-year-old boy who uses texting for almost everything says to me wistfully , &quot; someday , someday , but certainly not now , i &apos;d like to learn how to have a conversation . &quot; when i ask people &quot; what &apos;s wrong with having a conversation ? &quot; people say , &quot; i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s wrong with having a conversation .
the war and the expatriate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where i take local afghan fox fur and add it to a flack jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashionable neo-traditional vests .
and because fertility rates fell across that very same period that life expectancy was going up , that pyramid that has always represented the distribution of age in the population , with many young ones at the bottom winnowed to a tiny peak of older people who make it and survive to old age is being reshaped into a rectangle .
our experience as people who get sick , need help from other people , is that we have amazing clinicians that we can turn to -- hardworking , incredibly well-trained and very smart -- that we have access to incredible technologies that give us great hope , but little sense that it consistently all comes together for you from start to finish in a successful way .
so , i wrote this piece called &quot; avatar , &quot; which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects , of cg effects , beyond , with realistic human emotive characters generated in cg and the main characters would all be in cg and the world would be in cg and the envelope pushed back .
i made this last year , and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community , so my civic center colleagues and i made a tool kit , and now walls have been made in countries around the world , including kazakhstan , south africa , australia , argentina and beyond .
although there was a 19th-century newspaper editor who defined it rather better when he said , &quot; a snollygoster is a fellow who seeks office regardless of party , platform or principle , and who , when he wins , gets there by the sheer force of monumental talknophical assumnancy . &quot;
so i specialize in twentysomethings because i believe that every single one of those 50 million twentysomethings deserves to know what psychologists , sociologists , neurologists and fertility specialists already know : that claiming your 20s is one of the simplest , yet most transformative , things you can do for work , for love , for your happiness , maybe even for the world .
and i &apos;d like to look at how taking a simple kabul wheelbarrow and putting it on the wall amidst kipling &apos;s call of 1899 to generate dialogue about how i see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday &apos;s colonial rhetoric about a &quot; white man &apos;s burden &quot; to save the brown man from himself and maybe even civilize him a bit .
is he picking up on the fact that there are only boys in the universe except for aunt beru , and of course this princess , who &apos;s really cool , but who kind of waits around through most of the movie so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink to thank him for saving the universe , which he does by the magic that he was born with ?
so our sons are going to have to find some way of adapting to this , some new relationship with each other , and i think we really have to show them , and model for them , how a real man is someone who trusts his sisters and respects them , and wants to be on their team , and stands up against the real bad guys , who are the men who want to abuse the women .
we purified a chromosome from one microbial species -- roughly , these two are as distant as human and mice -- we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome , we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins , and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell -- and you &apos;ll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here .
long before that i had grown up with the war , but alongside weekend sleepovers and saturday soccer games and fistfights with racist children of the confederacy and religio-nationalist demonstrations chanting , &quot; down with communism and long live afghanistan , &quot; and burning effigies of brezhnev before i even knew what it meant .
and the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy , &quot; which makes it sound like a good thing , but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision-making from somebody who knows something -- namely , the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions -- namely , the patient .
but i &apos;m also happy and honored to be up here and i think that it &apos;s great that i got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and i &apos;d had more agency in my career , because maybe then i wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how i got my first job , or maybe i wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how i paid for college , which seems so important right now .
margaret mead , the great anthropologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities .
so when i was writing this talk , i found it very difficult to strike an honest balance , because on the one hand , i felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say , &quot; look i &apos;ve received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor , &quot; and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with , &quot; and it doesn &apos;t always make me happy . &quot;
and so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of , say , coal , and so , if you can deal with the negatives , which are essentially the radiation , the footprint and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
and so , that would be your response to the bjorn lomborg argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth , it &apos;s a stupid waste of the earth &apos;s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
connecting in sips may work for gathering discreet bits of information , they may work for saying , &quot; i &apos;m thinking about you , &quot; or even for saying , &quot; i love you , &quot; -- i mean , look at how i felt when i got that text from my daughter -- but they don &apos;t really work for learning about each other , for really coming to know and understand each other .
no biologists , for example , would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity -- scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity .
this is a reconstruction of notre dame cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from flickr . you just type notre dame into flickr , and you get some pictures of guys in t-shirts , and of the campus and so on . and each of these orange cones represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model .
so with help from old and new friends , i turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chalkboard and stenciled it with a fill-in-the-blank sentence : &quot; before i die , i want to ... &quot; so anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk , reflect on their lives , and share their personal aspirations in public space .
i would like to jump straight to one of noah &apos;s original data-sets -- and this is from an early prototype of photosynth that we first got working in the summer -- to show you what i think is really the punch line behind this technology , the photosynth technology . and it &apos;s not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments that we &apos;ve put up on the website .
we &apos;re on our way to solving -- and as i said earlier , i know we &apos;ve got a long way to go -- the one big issue that we &apos;re all focused on that threatens it , and that &apos;s the environmental issue , but i believe we all must turn all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination to help now solve this notion of global gridlock .
in turn , the word &quot; raheem , &quot; which is known in all abrahamic traditions , has the same root in arabic as the word &quot; rahem &quot; -- womb -- symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity from which the male and the female , from which all tribes , all peoples , have emanated from .
now if i take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trillionth of a second -- which is several femtoseconds -- i &apos;ll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide , and that packet of photons , that bullet , will travel at the speed of light , and , again , a million times faster than an ordinary bullet .
she &apos;s the author of &quot; strangers on a train &quot; and &quot; the talented mr. ripley , &quot; books that are all about how jealousy , it muddles our minds , and once we &apos;re in the sphere , in that realm of jealousy , the membrane between what is and what could be can be pierced in an instant .
it &apos;s going to take awhile , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life evaluation , so we need to have that debate fairly soon , how to enhance happiness , goes very different ways depending on how you think , and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self .
that made me a different human being than my friends amongst the kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of huxwhukw and the crooked beak of heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world , spirits they would have to engage during their hamatsa initiation .
and i helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in albany for 60 cents a kilo , but we found a way to take the fish for sushi to japan for 15 dollars a kilo , and the farmers came to talk to me , said , &quot; hey , you helped them . can you help us ? &quot;
i had this encounter recently where i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone , who &apos;s now in her 90s , but she &apos;s been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural virginia , she would be out working in the fields , and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape .
the computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots -- all taken near grassi lakes in the canadian rockies -- all these shots were taken . so you see elements here of stabilized slide-show or panoramic imaging , and these things have all been related spatially .
and , to dimensionalize this , i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made , for cars , for computers , for phones , for flashlights , for everything , and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses , and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
the volume has this connecting shape that shades itself with three different types of apartments and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood and in the courtyards there are the different facilities , such as a gym and a kindergarten and close by , a series of commercial &#91; spaces &#93; that bring activity to the ground floor .
you put on the uniform , and you become invisible until someone is upset with you for whatever reason like you &apos;ve blocked traffic with your truck , or you &apos;re taking a break too close to their home , or you &apos;re drinking coffee in their diner , and they will come and scorn you , and tell you that they don &apos;t want you anywhere near them .
and i was afraid , not for myself , but i was afraid that i was going to lose him , that he was going to sink into one of his states , and that i would ruin his relationship with the violin if i started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy .
we remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience and figure out why it is meaningful to us , why it is significant , why it &apos;s colorful , when we &apos;re able to transform it in some way that it makes sense in the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds , when we &apos;re able to transform bakers into bakers .
this idea , it saved me when i was in the middle of writing &quot; eat , pray , love , &quot; and i fell into one of those , sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , this is going to be the worst book ever written .
we &apos;re going to fire those bullets of light , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because the packet of the photons , they will scatter in all the directions , and some of them will reach our hidden mannequin , which in turn will again scatter that light , and again in turn the door will reflect some of that scattered light , and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera , but most interestingly , they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot .
in the first volume , swann &apos;s way , the series of books , swann , one of the main characters , is thinking very fondly of his mistress and how great she is in bed , and suddenly , in the course of a few sentences , and these are proustian sentences , so they &apos;re long as rivers , but in the course of a few sentences , he suddenly recoils and he realizes , &quot; hang on , everything i love about this woman , somebody else would love about this woman .
now , like doc edgerton , a scientist himself , science became art , an art of ultra-fast photography , and i realized that all the gigabytes of data that we &apos;re collecting every time is not just for scientific imaging , but we can also do a new form of computational photography with time-lapse and color-coding , and we look at those ripples . remember , the time between each of those ripples is only a few trillionths of a second .
one of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , you know , what salad dressing is ? -- it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better . and what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made , and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made , even if it was a good decision .
and at the end of this amazing initiation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sunrise . and in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory . and the priest steps back and says , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really as i &apos;ve told you .
and if we don &apos;t teach our children to be alone , they &apos;re only going to know when i spoke at ted in 1996 , reporting on my studies of the early virtual communities , i said , &quot; those who make the most of their lives on the screen come to it in a spirit of self-reflection . &quot; and that &apos;s what i &apos;m calling for here , now : reflection and , more than that , a conversation about where our current use of technology may be taking us , what it might be costing us .
i will leave the final word to an english scientist , humphrey davy , who , i suspect , when defending his protege &apos;s useless experiments -- his protege was michael faraday -- said this , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our triumphs are complete , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . &quot;
so , as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects -- along with my adviser pattie , and my collaborator jeevan kalanithi -- i started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop , what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically , arranging it the way we wanted ?
there &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the asmat or in the chilling winds of tibet , but they have , nevertheless , through time and ritual , forged a traditional mystique of the earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it , but on a far subtler intuition : the idea that the earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness .
this is just what medicine requires . &quot; when you go from a world where you treated arthritis with aspirin , that mostly didn &apos;t do the job , to one where , if it gets bad enough , we can do a hip replacement , a knee replacement that gives you years , maybe decades , without disability , a dramatic change , well is it any surprise that that $ 40,000 hip replacement replacing the 10-cent aspirin is more expensive ?
certainly , from a medical standpoint , my legs , laser surgery for vision impairment , titanium knee and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them , not to mention social networking platforms , allow people to self-identify , to claim their own descriptions of themselves , so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing .
the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood , whether it was winning a second grade spelling bee , marching with the girl scouts , you know , the halloween parade , winning my college scholarship , or any of my sports victories , and he was using it , and integrating it into teaching resident students , med students from hahnemann medical school and hershey medical school .
i satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians . &#91; &quot; correspondence in the family of <unk> lei &quot; &#93; i found my role model of an independent woman when confucian tradition requires obedience . &#91; &quot; jane eyre &quot; &#93; and i learned to be efficient from this book . &#91; &quot; cheaper by the dozen &quot; &#93; and i was inspired to study abroad after reading these .
and we also would be well informed to reach out to the people who do that work and get their expertise on how do we think about , how do we create systems around sustainability that perhaps take us from curbside recycling , which is a remarkable success across 40 years , across the united states and countries around the world , and lift us up to a broader horizon where we &apos;re looking at other forms of waste that could be lessened from manufacturing and industrial sources .
so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice hmi , and the client says , &quot; cameron , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
and so what i did in esperance that first year was to just walk the streets , and in three days i had my first client , and i helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage , was a maori guy , and i helped him to sell to the restaurant in perth , to get organized , and then the fishermen came to me to say , &quot; you the guy who helped maori ? can you help us ? &quot;
when you come back to the shore and you say , &quot; we had to do this , and the fiber optic , and the attentuation , and the this and that , all the technology of it , and the difficulty , the human performance aspects of working at sea , you can &apos;t explain it to people . it &apos;s that thing that maybe cops have , or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity , is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience , as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics , or what other people perceive as my disability .
so whether it &apos;s for photography around corners , or creating the next generation of health imaging , or creating new visualizations , since our invention , we have open-sourced all the data and details on our website , and our hope is that the diy , the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obsessing about the megapixels in cameras — — and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging .
now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road , but in the future , we could create cars that avoid collisions with what &apos;s around the bend , or we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows , or we can build endoscopes that can see deep inside the body around occluders , and also for cardioscopes .
the young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years : two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s womb ; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother .
the surgery on offer was pretty gruesome -- anesthetize you , open your chest , put you on an artificial heart and lung machine , drop your body temperature to about 18 centigrade , stop your heart , cut the aorta out , replace it with a plastic valve and a plastic aorta , and , most importantly , commit you to a lifetime of anticoagulation therapy , normally warfarin .
one person wrote in , &quot; when i win , i &apos;m going to buy my own little mountain and have a little house on top . &quot; and another person wrote , &quot; i would fill a big bathtub with money and get in the tub while smoking a big fat cigar and sipping a glass of champagne . &quot; this is even worse now : &quot; then i &apos;d have a picture taken and dozens of glossies made .
i want to look into corruption in afghanistan through a work called &quot; payback &quot; and impersonate a police officer , set up a fake checkpoint on the street of kabul and stop cars , but instead of asking them for a bribe , offering them money and apologizing on behalf of the kabul police department -- and hoping that they &apos;ll accept this 100 afghanis on our behalf .
now we teach entrepreneurship to 16-year-olds in northumberland , and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of richard branson &apos;s autobiography , and the task of the 16-year-olds is to underline , in the first two pages of richard branson &apos;s autobiography how many times richard uses the word &quot; i &quot; and how many times he uses the word &quot; we . &quot;
and i &apos;m telling a story that many of you know , because steve &apos;s columns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with robert downey jr acting as steve lopez , and jamie foxx as nathaniel anthony ayers , the juilliard-trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia .
in fact , i used to argue with my professor , richard evan shultes -- who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the 1930s -- i used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hallucination .
and i think our job in the netflix queue is to look out for those movies that pass the bechdel test , if we can find them , and to seek out the heroines who are there , who show real courage , who bring people together , and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines and to say , &quot; i want to be on their team , &quot; because they &apos;re going to be on their team .
if somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are , then my photo of notre dame cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data , and i can use it as an entry point to dive into that space , into that meta-verse , using everybody else &apos;s photos , and do a kind of a cross-modal and cross-user social experience that way .
the entire art of what is going on in these memory contests and the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life is figuring out ways to transform capital b bakers into lower-case b bakers -- to take information that is lacking in context , in significance , in meaning and transform it in some way so that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things that you have in your mind .
i once travelled 6,000 miles from chengdu in western china overland through southeastern tibet to lhasa with a young colleague , and it was only when i got to lhasa that i understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes , 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the cultural revolution .
i led an initiative by the libyan women &apos;s platform for peace to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law , a law that would give every citizen , no matter what your background , the right to vote and run , and most importantly to stipulate on political parties the alternation of male and female candidates vertically and horizontally in their lists , creating the zipper list .
wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away ; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to : whether it &apos;s the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the penan -- a nomadic people from southeast asia , from sarawak -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers , where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of borneo away to the south china sea , where the japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest -- or , in the case of the yanomami , it &apos;s the disease entities that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
instead , they agreed to use the title &quot; president &quot; for now , but they also wanted it absolutely set down that they didn &apos;t agree with it from a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civilized nations , whether under republican or monarchical forms of government , whose custom it is to annex , through the office of the chief magistrate , titles of respectability -- not bloody president -- and that in the intercourse with foreign nations , the majesty of the people of the united states may not be hazarded by an appearance of singularity , i.e. , we don &apos;t want to look like bloody weirdos .
just to know that jaguar shamans still journey beyond the milky way , or the myths of the inuit elders still resonate with meaning , or that in the himalaya , the buddhists still pursue the breath of the dharma , is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made , albeit successfully , many generations ago .
what makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation , but the elaboration of it . it &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines , harmine , harmaline , mildly hallucinogenic -- to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness -- but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called psychotria viridis .
&#91; &quot; personal history &quot; by katharine graham &#93; &#91; &quot; the snowball : warren buffett and the business of life , &quot; by alice schroeder &#93; i also compare the same stories in different genres -- &#91; holy bible : king james version &#93; &#91; &quot; lamb &quot; by chrisopher moore &#93; -- or similar stories from different cultures , as joseph campbell did in his wonderful book . &#91; &quot; the power of myth &quot; by joseph campbell &#93; for example , both the christ and the buddha went through three temptations .
and what we &apos;re doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradually , one by one , the central revelation of anthropology : that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being .
and whether it is the penan in the forests of borneo , or the voodoo acolytes in haiti , or the warriors in the kaisut desert of northern kenya , the curandero in the mountains of the andes , or a caravans<unk> in the middle of the sahara -- this is incidentally the fellow that i traveled into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of qomolangma , everest , the goddess mother of the world .
