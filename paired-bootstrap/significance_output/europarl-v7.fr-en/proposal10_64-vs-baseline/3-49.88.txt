à la fin des années 1970 , les monétaristes avaient fait le pari que seule une augmentation modeste et transitoire du chômage pouvait contenir l&apos; inflation rampante - et ouverte - de l&apos; occident industriel , et qu&apos; avec le recul le coût du retour à la stabilité des prix effective en aurait valu la peine .

cela signifie que les organismes de retraite et d&apos; impôt doivent être conçus pour prendre davantage en compte les circonstances changeantes auxquelles doivent faire face les différentes générations plutôt que de faire des promesses figées , qui ne pourront très certainement pas être tenues de toute manière , d&apos; un certain rétablissement à l&apos; avenir .
