in no small measure , the failures of globalization can be traced to the same mindset that led to the failures in iraq : multilateral institutions must serve not just one country &apos;s interest , but all countries &apos; .
in many cases , we can establish that the failures of globalisation go back to the same state of mind which is chairing the failure of the iraqi occupation : the pluralist institutions must not be at the service of the interests of one country but of all countries .
