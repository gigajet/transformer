jestliže tak značná část náskoku usa v oblasti produktivity skutečně spočívá v tom , že wal-mart a jeho halové sourozence necháváme vyřádit , co se stane , až tento zdroj růstu začne opadat ?
if so much of the us productivity edge really amounts to letting wal-mart and its big-box cousins run amok , what will happen after this source of growth tapers off ?
indeed , if such a considerable part of the united states of productivity in the field of productivity is that wal-mart and his native courts are not allowed to correct what will happen when this source of growth starts ?
indeed , if such a large part of the us in the productivity sector is in fact the fact that wallis and its homeland are left out of good lines , what happens when this source of growth begins ?

zatímco komunistické strany v polsku a maďarsku zažívaly vnitřní liberalizaci , která dovolovala relativně polooficiální zóny aktivit vně komunistické kontroly , československo se po invazi vojsk varsavské smlouvy v roce 1968 stalo strnulým neostalinistickým režimem .

skepticismus respondentů je stěží neopodstatněný : interní listiny získané v nedávných soudních procesech odhalují , že farmaceutické společnosti často nepředají regulačním orgánům významné informace o bezpečnosti léčiv , jak požaduje zákon , a tyto informace nesdělí ani lékařům a pacientům .
their <<unk>> ticism is hardly groundless : internal documents obtained in recent lawsuits reveal that drug companies often fail to submit critical safety information to regulatory agencies , as required by law , and fail to communicate such information to physicians and patients .

nedávné důkazy , podle nichž se dal počet mrtvých a zraněných značně snížit , pokud by byli vojáci vybaveni lepšími neprůstřelnými vestami , vypovídají o tom , jak může krátkodobá spořivost vést k dlouhodobým nákladům .
recent evidence that deaths and injuries would have been greatly reduced had better body armor been provided to troops suggests how short-run frugality can lead to long-run costs .

jedním důvodem , proč k tomu stále nedochází , je to , že německo je příliš zaneprázdněné všemožnými pokusy o vyloučení polských , českých a maďarských dělníků ze svého trhu práce , než aby bylo schopno účinně tlačit na přijetí takových reforem .
one reason that won &apos;t happen because germany is too busy trying to keep out polish , czech and hungarian workers to press for such reforms .

zemědělská politika eu se začala reformovat a její podíl na rozpočtu eu klesl z více než 60 % na 40 % ; británie se několik let těšila značně vyššímu hospodářskému růstu než ostatní členské státy , takže dnes patří k bohatším zemím eu , a to i ve srovnání s francií a německem ; a nové členské země jsou o tolik chudší než i ti nejchudší ze starých členů , že mají nezadatelné morální právo na štědrý podíl z jakéhokoliv rozpočtu , který lze dojednat .

nejjasnějším příkladem tohoto trendu je maďarsko , kde premiér viktor orbán v rámci své volební kampaně , s níž nakonec jen o vlásek neuspěl , požadoval zrušení tzv. benešových dekretů z roku 1945 , na jejichž základě přišli o majetek i občanství němečtí a maďarští občané československa , kteří tehdy byli deportováni .
the clearest case of this comes from hungary , where prime minister viktor orban demanded an abrogation of president edvard benes &apos; decrees of 1945 ( which confiscated the assets of and stripped citizenship from the german and hungarian populations deported from czechoslovakia at that time ) as part of a re-election campaign that failed narrowly .
the most clear example of this is hungary , where the prime minister , mr orbán , in his election campaign , which , at the end of the time , has not been called for to abolish the so-called decree of 1945 blocs , whose citizenship on the basis of hungarian citizenship and the hungarian people were located at the time , when the prime minister , prime minister , prime minister vicinor orbán , in his election campaign , who , in the end , did not only have called for the withdrawal of the so-called decree of the so-called deira on the 1945 years of 1945 .
the most clear example of this hungary , where prime minister video &apos;s election campaign , which , in the end , was not just about the abolition of the 1945 , of which the prime minister of hungary is the most clear example of this trend , where prime minister video &apos;s prime minister , in his election campaign , with only the governments , in the end , did not only have called for the abolition of the so-called 1945 , of which had been requested by the german hungarian citizens and the hungarian citizens at the time of hungary , in the case of hungary &apos;s citizens .
