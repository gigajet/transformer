základní intuice jana pavla ii. je nicméně správná : postkomunistický svět - na východě i na západě - se nachází v duchovní krizi a papež chce tímto světem otřást , aby si uvědomil důležitost vyšších hodnot .

however , it is about structured cooperation - this means that some european states can deepen the defence - as we are not prepared to allow ourselves to accept more cautious and cautious tragedies of the balkans , when we cannot act with a structured cooperation between the balkans and cannot negotiate with some of the european states in order to deepen the defence of european states - as we are not prepared to admit , as we are not prepared to allow ourselves to allow ourselves to accept a more cautious and rehabilitact or a repetition of the tragedy of the balkans .
however , this is a structured cooperation - some of the european states , in order to further deepen the ability - because we are not willing to allow the more prudent and ridiculous years of the balkans , when europeans have failed to act in a structured manner - to further deepen the european states - because we are not prepared to allow us to recognise the more prudent and reluctant years of the balkans , when they were unable to act for the years to act and resolute by the united states ( the united states of america ) .
