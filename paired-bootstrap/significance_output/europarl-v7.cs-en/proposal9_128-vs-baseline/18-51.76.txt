pokud přesvědčivá fakta prokáží , že irák měl zbraně hromadného ničení při ruce , že byly v nebezpečném rozsahu nachystány k použití a že inspektoři osn měli malé vyhlídky na odhalení a zničení těchto zbraní , pak budeme muset argumenty vznesené bushem a blairem uznat .

indeed , has the chance to persuade mr grademos to convince that he has been a big israel to take a stand which , in any case , had his dream , actually meant the end of the jewish state , or his strategy to build gaza as the first to build power in the first place , meant that gaza was , in fact , the last ?
indeed , the arrogance of arrogance has been abandoned , indeed , to persuade the fact that a large israel , who , if he had been in all his dream , would actually mean the end of the jewish state , or his strategy for the withdrawal of gaza as the first assassination of gaza , actually included gaza as the last one ?

jak znovu prokázal v devadesátých letech miloševič , když tvrdil , že brání nevinné srby v chorvatsku a bosně , ospravedlňování vojenského zásahu pouze na základě morálních principů ponechává příliš mnoho místa pro jejich překrucování a zneužívání .

když prezident požádal americkou národní akademii věd , aby se na tento problém zaměřila , dospěla akademie k senzačnímu závěru ( ostatně k jedinému , k jakému mohla při poctivém přístupu dospět ) : totiž že skleníkové plyny představují hrozbu .

současný boom zažívá nákazu uvnitř trhů i napříč trhy , neboť rostoucí ceny přiživují vzrušení veřejnosti - a potažmo další cenový nárůst - nejprve ve stejném městě a poté v městech dalších , ba dokonce i na druhém konci planety .

když nás v kalkatě oslovilo nějaké mladší dítě a chtělo se zapojit do hry , jíž jsme se s kamarády bavili , dovolili jsme mu to , ale nejdřív jsme zašeptali slova elé belé jeden druhému do ucha . elé belé je účastník hry , který si myslí , že je součástí dění , ale ve skutečnosti pouze dělá prázdné pohyby .
in calcutta , when some younger kid came along and insisted on joining the game my friends were playing , we would let the new kid in , but only after whispering into each other &apos;s ears the words , elé belé . an elé belé is a player who thinks he is participating but , in truth , is merely going through the motions .
however , when there were some younger children in calendar and wanted to be involved in the game that we have taken with the mars , we have allowed him , but we have just asked the other words of a wonderful single person in mr kallas , when he called us a young child in caller , and he thinks that he is part of the game , but in the first place .

skutečnost je však taková , že nikdo žádné kroky k volnějším měnovým politikám nepodniká <unk> zejména s ohledem na nezkušenou evropskou centrální banku , jež zoufale touží vydobýt si věrohodnost bojovníka proti inflaci <unk> a že kroky ke strukturálním reformám jsou nesmělé , váhavé a nevýrazné .
but the reality is that steps toward looser monetary policies are non-existent -- especially with the fledgling european central bank anxious to establish its inflation-fighting credibility -- and that steps toward structural reforms are half-hearted , hesitant , and small .
however , no one is taking any steps to freeze the new policies , particularly with regard to the european central bank , which is desperately trying to fight inflation , and that the structural reforms are difficult to reform .
however , there is no such thing that no action to be taken by the new policies does not , in particular , include the non-european central bank , which is desperately committed to the structural reforms , but it is no one to call for the new policies that do not take into account the new policies that do not take place in particular with regard to the non-european central bank , which desperately harassment , but to deliberate the recovery of the structural reforms to the structural reforms of the non-structural reforms .

foxes will often agree with hedgehogs up to a point , before complicating things : &quot; yes , my colleague is right that the saudi monarchy is vulnerable , but remember that coups are rare and that the government commands many means of squelching opposition . &quot;
however , my colleague is right to remember that the government often agrees to some extent with the lakes , but then complies with the whole thing : my colleague is right that it is vulnerable , but let us remember that the government is taking hasty and that there are many means of colony , as i can see , but then it complies with the whole thing : yes , my colleague is right that he is right to say that he is vulnerable , but he is vulnerable to think that it is ruined , that the racial government is dominant and that there are many of the government that there are a lot of the money that is in place .
however , they often agree to a certain extent , but they are doing the whole thing : my colleague , my truth , is vulnerable , but let us bear in mind the scarcity of the scarcity government , which is often a substitute to a certain extent , but then the whole thing does not take place : yes , my colleague , my truth , is the truth , that it is vulnerable , but that it is vulnerable to the scarcely vulnerable , to the scarcity government , that the scarcest government is a scarcity and a large government that there are a large number of centuality .
