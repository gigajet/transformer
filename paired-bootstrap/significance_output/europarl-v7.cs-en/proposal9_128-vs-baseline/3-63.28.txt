protože však vláda neomezila jiné výdaje a nezvýšila daně , byly tyto výdaje financovány dluhem , jehož úrokové zatížení zvýší rozpočtové náklady o dalších 98 ( konzervativní odhad ) až 385 ( umírněný odhad ) miliard dolarů .
arguably , since the government has not reined in other expenditures or increased taxes , the expenditures have been debt financed , and the interest costs on this debt add another $ 98 billion ( conservative ) to $ 385 billion ( moderate ) to the budgetary costs .
however , because the government has not limited other spending and has not increased taxes , these costs have been financed by debt , whose interest burden will increase the budget costs of other 98 ( conservative estimate ) to 385 ( moderate estimate ) .

téměř každý <unk> snad s výjimkou exxonmobilu , viceprezidenta usa dicka cheneyho , jejich placených služebníků a pomýlených nohsledů <unk> chápe , že když lidé spalují uhlovodíky , uvolňuje se do atmosféry oxid uhličitý , jenž se zde chová jako obrovská duchna , která pohlcuje infračervené záření stoupající zdola , a tím otepluje zeměkouli .
almost everyone -- except the likes of exxonmobil , us vice president dick cheney , and their paid servants and deluded acolytes -- understands that when humans burn hydrocarbons , carbon dioxide goes into the atmosphere , where it acts like a giant blanket , absorbing infrared radiation coming up from below and warming the earth .
in addition to the ex-mobile , the united states vice-president dick , their paid staff and the myth of nobel demonstrating that , when people are spilling hydrocarbons , exxes , the united states vice-president dick and cherry are incurred , they understand that when people are incurring hydrocarbons , they are released into the atmosphere of carbon dioxide , which is like a huge breath of breeding , which is squeezing through the spraisers and famble rables .
perhaps almost everyone is in favour of an excess of exile , the vice-president of the united states , mr dicherck and cherchernobyl , their paid service and the dual watchful trawings , when people see hydrocarbating hydrocarbons , freezes into the atmosphere of carbon dioxide , which is swept into a huge metering , which is baging the red and burning infrastructure .

stejná logika , podle níž dnes potřebujeme svých 70 dolarů více , než budou lidé roku 2100 potřebovat jejich 500 dolarů , tedy velí , že bychom měli více zdaňovat bohatý svět <unk> tak dlouho , dokud bude každých 500 dolarů navíc v podobě daní v bohatém světě generovat pouhých 70 dolarů navíc v podobě příjmů na hlavu v chudých zemích .
the same logic that says we need our $ 70 more than the people of 2100 need an extra $ 500 dictates that we should tax the world &apos;s rich more , as long as each extra $ 500 in first-world taxes generates as little as an extra $ 70 in poor countries per capita incomes .
in addition , the same logic , which we need today 70 dollars more than 2100 500 dollars , that is to say , that more than a long rigid world , is that every 500 dollar in the world will be able to build up to 70 dollars in the form of income in the shape of poor countries , and that is to say , we should be more successful in the rich world as long as every 500 per 500 dollars are in the shape of the world in the rich world , even though it is in the rich in the shape of 70 times .
today , the same logic , according to which we need 70 dollars more than 100 people will need 100 500 dollars , so that we should increase the richer world as long as the 500 in every day in the world , as long as 70 dollars in the world are used in the world , we need 70 people more than 100 500 dollars in the world .

the palestinian leadership could also start down the difficult road of telling the refugees that -- contrary to almost 50 years of palestinian propaganda -- they will not return to israel , but will have to be settled in the west bank and gaza , the areas that will become part of the eventual palestinian state .
it would also be possible for the palestinian leadership to decide on a more difficult path and to tell refugees about what has been announced for 50 years by the palestinian propaganda in israel , but they will have to go back to the west bank and , therefore , in the areas that will become more difficult to take up the path of the future , and that they will have to take part in what has been announced over 50 years , compared to the 50 years of the palestinian propaganda in israel .
