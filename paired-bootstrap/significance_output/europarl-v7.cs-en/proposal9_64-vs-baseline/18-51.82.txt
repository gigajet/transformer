když nás v kalkatě oslovilo nějaké mladší dítě a chtělo se zapojit do hry , jíž jsme se s kamarády bavili , dovolili jsme mu to , ale nejdřív jsme zašeptali slova elé belé jeden druhému do ucha . elé belé je účastník hry , který si myslí , že je součástí dění , ale ve skutečnosti pouze dělá prázdné pohyby .
