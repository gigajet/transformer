hospodářství usa má mnoho jiných silných stránek , mimo jiné vynikající finanční soustavu a přední postavení v high-tech kapitálových statcích , zůstává ale skutečností , že americká výhoda v těchto oblastech zatím není ani zdaleka tak ohromující jako fenomén wal-mart .

protože však vláda neomezila jiné výdaje a nezvýšila daně , byly tyto výdaje financovány dluhem , jehož úrokové zatížení zvýší rozpočtové náklady o dalších 98 ( konzervativní odhad ) až 385 ( umírněný odhad ) miliard dolarů .

téměř každý <unk> snad s výjimkou exxonmobilu , viceprezidenta usa dicka cheneyho , jejich placených služebníků a pomýlených nohsledů <unk> chápe , že když lidé spalují uhlovodíky , uvolňuje se do atmosféry oxid uhličitý , jenž se zde chová jako obrovská duchna , která pohlcuje infračervené záření stoupající zdola , a tím otepluje zeměkouli .
almost everyone -- except the likes of exxonmobil , us vice president dick cheney , and their paid servants and deluded acolytes -- understands that when humans burn hydrocarbons , carbon dioxide goes into the atmosphere , where it acts like a giant blanket , absorbing infrared radiation coming up from below and warming the earth .
perhaps almost every one of the exception of the exxon mobile mobile , the us vice-president dichinner , their paid staff and the pockets of the pockets , who understands that when people are burning hydrocarbons , is freezing into a atmosphere that is amazing as a huge bill , which is buying the storm of the storm , which is stunning the storm of storm , which is storm and smoke .
perhaps almost everyone is in favour of an excess of exile , the vice-president of the united states , mr dicherck and cherchernobyl , their paid service and the dual watchful trawings , when people see hydrocarbating hydrocarbons , freezes into the atmosphere of carbon dioxide , which is swept into a huge metering , which is baging the red and burning infrastructure .

stejná logika , podle níž dnes potřebujeme svých 70 dolarů více , než budou lidé roku 2100 potřebovat jejich 500 dolarů , tedy velí , že bychom měli více zdaňovat bohatý svět <unk> tak dlouho , dokud bude každých 500 dolarů navíc v podobě daní v bohatém světě generovat pouhých 70 dolarů navíc v podobě příjmů na hlavu v chudých zemích .
the same logic that says we need our $ 70 more than the people of 2100 need an extra $ 500 dictates that we should tax the world &apos;s rich more , as long as each extra $ 500 in first-world taxes generates as little as an extra $ 70 in poor countries per capita incomes .
in addition , the same logic that we need today is more than 2100 people need to need their eur 500 dollars , that is to say that we should be more rich the world for a long time as every 500 dollars in the years of genetic dollars in the world will have to be rich in the face of 70 years in the form of genetic dollars in the world .
today , the same logic , according to which we need 70 dollars more than 100 people will need 100 500 dollars , so that we should increase the richer world as long as the 500 in every day in the world , as long as 70 dollars in the world are used in the world , we need 70 people more than 100 500 dollars in the world .

palestinské vedení by se rovněž mohlo rozhodnout pro obtížnější cestu a sdělit uprchlíkům , že <unk> oproti tomu , co téměř 50 let hlásala palestinská propaganda <unk> se už do izraele nevrátí , ale budou se muset usadit na západním břehu a v gaze , tedy v oblastech , které se stanou součástí budoucího palestinského státu .
the palestinian leadership could also start down the difficult road of telling the refugees that -- contrary to almost 50 years of palestinian propaganda -- they will not return to israel , but will have to be settled in the west bank and gaza , the areas that will become part of the eventual palestinian state .
the palestinian leadership could also decide for the most difficult refugees , that , over 50 years , the palestinian state has been going to go back to israel , but they will not have to return to the west bank , so they will have to be able to find a more difficult way for the palestinian leadership , and that the way that it is going to say that , over 50 years , almost 50 of the palestinian state has been reported to israel , but they will have to go back to the west bank and gaza , which is going to the conflict , in the future area , which is going to come into force .

američané sice tvrdí , že nmd není namířen proti nikomu , že usa jen chtějí chránit své občany proti zemím , jako je irák nebo severní korea , ale téměř celý zbytek světa si myslí něco jiného : rusko se bojí , že se amerika pokouší navždy upevnit svou vojenskou převahu ( a podřízenost ruska ) , čína má za to , že prostřednictvím nmd spojené státy naznačují tchaj-wanu , že mu pomohou v boji za nezávislost , zatímco evropa si myslí , že americké plány přispívají k napětí s ruskem a že by mohly spojené státy odloučit od evropy .

while the americans say that the nd is not directed against anyone , the us only wants to protect its citizens , such as iraq or north korea , but almost the rest of the world thinks something else : russia is always trying to strengthen its military coup with russia and russia , because it is responsible for the united states of europe to help the united states of taiwan to fight for the independence of europe , to help the united states and the united states of russia , to help the united states of europe to move away from the united states and to the united nations .
while the us is saying that the nd is not against anyone who want to protect its citizens , such as iraq or north korea , but almost the rest of the world : russia is struggling that the americans are trying to consolidate their military basin and russia ( china ) , that the united states of china , the united states , who wants to protect its citizens , such as iraq or north korea , but almost the rest of the world , is looking for something else : russia is fighting : it is that america is always trying to consolidate its military department by the united states ( russia ) , that the united states of china is committed to the united states , that they think that the united states of europe &apos;s independence and the united states of russia &apos;s independence and the united states , the united states , the united states , that the united states , the united states of america and the united states , the united states , that of the united states , that of europe &apos;s independence of america and
