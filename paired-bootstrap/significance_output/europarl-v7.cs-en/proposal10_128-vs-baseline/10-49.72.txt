základní intuice jana pavla ii. je nicméně správná : postkomunistický svět - na východě i na západě - se nachází v duchovní krizi a papež chce tímto světem otřást , aby si uvědomil důležitost vyšších hodnot .

do doby konání příštích řádných voleb může vyjít najevo , že pro schröderovu politiku neexistovala žádná skutečná alternativa , a dokonce to může dopadnout i tak , že se v té době již projeví předpokládaný přínos bolestných reforem .

however , this is a structured cooperation - some of the european states , in order to further deepen the ability - because we are not willing to allow the more prudent and ridiculous years of the balkans , when europeans have failed to act in a structured manner - to further deepen the european states - because we are not prepared to allow us to recognise the more prudent and reluctant years of the balkans , when they were unable to act for the years to act and resolute by the united states ( the united states of america ) .
