verfechter einer umgänglicheren herangehensweise äußern , die uno werde , wenn sie sich heraushalte , irrelevant werden ; würde sie aber ihren anteil im irak übernehmen , dürfte sie in amerika vertrauen gewinnen , so dass dann , wenn wieder einmal ein streit wie dieser hier ausbräche , amerika sich früher an die uno wenden werde .
advocates of a softer approach say that if the un stays on the sidelines , it will become irrelevant ; by participating in iraq , it will build trust with america , so that the next time a dispute such as this arises , america will turn earlier to the un .
but it would take on board its share in iraq , it should gain confidence in america , so that if there is a dispute like this , the united nations will , if it is to be excluded , then it will be able to take on board the un earlier .
if the un is to be taken into account , it would be irrelevant , but it would assume its share in iraq , it should win confidence in america , so that once again a dispute like this house , america will turn to the un earlier .

sicher jedoch ist , dass das vakuum , das sharons ausscheiden aus der politik hinterlassen hat , umso bemerkenswerter ist angesichts der aus dem von israel geräumten gazastreifen zu uns dringenden bilder des chaos und des sich vor unseren augen abspielenden zusammenbruchs der palästinenserbehörde .

die stã <unk> rke eines kanzlers beruht jedoch nicht primã <unk> r auf den ihm ã ¼ bertragenen verfassungsmã <unk> ã <unk> igen befugnissen , sondern auf dem rã ¼ ckhalt , den er innerhalb der eigenen partei genieã <unk> t .
however , the main source of any german chancellor &apos;s strength is not to be found in the legal powers conferred upon him by the constitution ; it is the actual support he holds within his own party .
however , it is not primarily a matter of primr to the government of the constitution , which has been held by the government of the constitution , but which is not the prime minister , but which is responsible for the rubbish of a company , which is not the prime minister of the government of the constitution , but which is committed to the ringstuffs that he has made in his own party .
however , it is not a matter of great concern to a chancellor that is not the key element of the premise of the violence that he has committed to the constitutional process of justice , but that it is based on the rhindry of justice , that he is strongly committed to the violence that he has committed in his own party .

unzählige details wurden beachtet : thailand flog botschafter in die betroffenen landesteile , damit diese ihren landsleuten hilfe leisten konnten ; man half menschen , die ihr geld und ihren pass verloren hatten bei ihrer heimkehr ; die verletzten wurden versorgt , systeme zur leichenidentifizierung geschaffen und nach lösungen gesucht , um die probleme im zusammenhang mit dem mangel an leichensäcken und gekühlten aufbewahrungsorten für die toten bewältigen .
myriad details were addressed : thailand flew ambassadors to the affected part of the country to help attend to the needs of their citizens , helped those who lost their money and passports return home , provided health care for the injured , set up systems to identify bodies , and dealt with the difficulties posed by shortages of body bags and the lack of cold storage facilities .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , mr president-in-office of the council , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , there are many details that have been taken into account : thailand has been taken of many details : in the midst of the prisoners affected , so that they have been able to help their compatriots ; people who lost their money and their passport in their homes ; the last ones have been offered to identify and seek solutions to deal with the problems in connection with the lack of clarity and friction for the dead .

while it seems to be premature to speak , as some in germany now do , of a &quot; twilight of the chancellor &quot; or to call schröder &apos;s surprising step &quot; the beginning of the end &quot; of his tenure , it is perfectly correct to describe it as a dramatic loss of power .
although it appears that it would appear that it would be necessary to talk about a government of chancellor , as is currently the case with some of us , or to call a crystal clear step from the beginning of its term of office , it would seem to be a dramatic loss of power to be found in this house .
although it seems that it seems that it seems to be fresh to talk of a growing role for the chancellor , as is currently the case on some sides , the issue of the development of the action plan , or the action plan for action , which is the first step of the end of the term of office &apos; its term &apos; , it seems to be quite regrettable that there is a very serious loss of power in such a dramatic loss of power , as in some quarters , at the moment , in the case of the case of the case of a few pages , or the development of the action plan , which is the case , which is the case , the case of which is a failure to take place , which is a major steps forward .
