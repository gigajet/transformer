da die regierung aber weder andere ausgaben beschränkt noch steuern erhöht hat , wurden die militärausgaben fremdfinanziert und so kommen zu den direkten kosten wohl noch einmal zwischen 98 milliarden dollar ( konservativ ) und 385 milliarden dollar ( moderat ) an zinskosten für diese schulden hinzu .
